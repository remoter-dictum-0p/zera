I'd be happy to assist you with that. Here's a Python function to find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array:
```python
def find_min_rotated_array(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return nums[left]
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
* We loop until `left` is no longer less than `right`.
* In each iteration, we calculate the midpoint `mid` using integer division.
* We check if the element at `mid` is greater than the element at `right`. If it is, we know that the minimum element must be in the right half of the array, so we set `left` to `mid + 1`.
* If the element at `mid` is not greater than the element at `right`, we know that the minimum element must be in the left half of the array, so we set `right` to `mid`.
* When the loop exits, `left` will be pointing to the minimum element in the rotated array.

Here's an example:
```python
nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
print(find_min_rotated_array(nums))  # Output: 0
```
This function assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order and then rotated some number of times. If the array is not rotated at all, the function will still return the correct minimum element.

In this function, we first count the occurrences of each element in the tuple. Then, we iterate over the tuple again and append each element to a new list if it occurs only once.

To multiply two integers without using the `*` operator in Python, we can use a simple loop that adds the first number to itself as many times as the second number. Here's an example function:
```python
def multiply(a, b):
    result = 0
    for _ in range(abs(b)):
        result += a
    if b < 0:
        return -result
    return result
```
Here's an explanation of how it works:

1. We initialize a variable `result` to 0, which will store the final product.
2. We use a loop that runs `abs(b)` times, where `abs(b)` is the absolute value of `b`. This is because we want to add `a` to itself `b` times, regardless of whether `b` is positive or negative.
3. Inside the loop, we add `a` to `result` in each iteration.
4. After the loop, we check if `b` is negative. If it is, we return the negative of `result`, because multiplying by a negative number should result in a negative product.
5. Finally, we return the `result`.

To answer your question, here's a Python function that counts the integers in a given list:
```python
def count_integers(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the elements in the list, and the `isinstance` function to check if each element is an integer. The `sum` function then adds up the number of integers found.

For example, if you call the function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 4, 5.5, 6]`, it would return `5`, because there are 5 integers in the list.

Now, let's get to the task at hand. Removing uppercase substrings from a given string using regex can be achieved with the following function:
```python
import re

def remove_uppercase_substrings(s):
    return re.sub(r'[A-Z]+', '', s)

Here's an explanation of how the function works:

* The `re.sub` function is used to replace substrings in the input string `s`.
* The regular expression `[A-Z]+` matches one or more uppercase characters (A-Z).
* The `re.sub` function replaces these matched uppercase substrings with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing them from the input string.

Example usage:
```python
input_string = ""Hello WORLD, this is a TEST string""
output_string = remove_uppercase_substrings(input_string)
print(output_string)  # Output: ""Hello , this is a  string""
```

To sort a list of elements in ascending order using the heap queue algorithm, you can use the `heapq` module in Python. Here's an example function:
```python
import heapq

def heap_sort(lst):
    heapq.heapify(lst)
    return [heapq.heappop(lst) for _ in range(len(lst))]
```
Here's an explanation of how it works:

1. `heapq.heapify(lst)`: This function transforms the input list `lst` into a heap, which is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: the parent node is either greater than or equal to both child nodes.
2. `return [heapq.heappop(lst) for _ in range(len(lst)))]`: This list comprehension pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `len(lst)` times, effectively sorting the list in ascending order.

You can test this function with a sample list, like this:
```python
lst = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 4, 6]
sorted_lst = heap_sort(lst)
print(sorted_lst)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]
```
Note that the `heapq` module provides an efficient implementation of the heap queue algorithm, with a time complexity of O(n log n) for sorting.

```python
def convert_to_float(lst):
    return [float(i) if isinstance(i, (int, str)) and i.replace('.', '', 1).isdigit() else i for i in lst]
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:

1. The function takes a list `lst` as input.
2. The list comprehension iterates over each element `i` in the list.
3. The `isinstance` function checks if the element is either an integer or a string.
4. The `replace` method is used to remove the decimal point (if present) and check if the remaining string consists only of digits using the `isdigit` method. This is to ensure that the string can be converted to a float.
5. If the element is convertible, it's converted to a float using the `float` function. Otherwise, the original element is kept unchanged.
6. The resulting list with converted elements is returned.

Here's an example usage:
```python
>>> lst = [1, '2.5', 'hello', 3, '4', '5.6']
>>> convert_to_float(lst)
[1.0, 2.5, 'hello', 3.0, 4.0, 5.6]

Now, let's get to the task at hand. To find the perimeter of a cylinder, we need to calculate the circumference of the circular bases and add the height of the cylinder. Here's a Python function to do just that:
```python
import math

def cylinder_perimeter(radius, height):
    circumference = 2 * math.pi * radius
    perimeter = 2 * circumference + height
    return perimeter
```
This function takes in two arguments: `radius` and `height`, which are the radius of the circular base and the height of the cylinder, respectively.

You can call this function with the desired values, like this:
```python
radius = 5
height = 10
perimeter = cylinder_perimeter(radius, height)

To find the perimeter of a triangle, we need to know the lengths of its three sides. Here's a simple function in Python to calculate the perimeter:

```
def triangle_perimeter(a, b, c):
    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
        return a + b + c
    else:
        return ""Error: The input values do not form a valid triangle.""
```

In this function, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the lengths of the three sides of the triangle. The function first checks if the input values can form a valid triangle (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the third side). If they can, it returns the perimeter by adding the three side lengths together. If they can't, it returns an error message.

Actually, I think there might be some misunderstanding. You're here to help me, but I'm the AI assistant, and I'm here to help you!

But anyway, I'd be happy to help you with that Python function. Here's a possible solution:
```python
def find_missing_number(arr):

        if arr[i + 1] - arr[i] > 1:
            return arr[i] + 1
    return None
```
This function assumes that the input array is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the array, checking the difference between each element and the next one. If the difference is greater than 1, it means that there's a missing number, and the function returns that missing number. If no missing number is found, the function returns `None`.

Here's an example usage:
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
print(find_missing_number(arr))  # Output: 4

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(find_missing_number(arr))  # Output: None

The problem asks to write a function that finds the nth smart number. A smart number is defined as a number that has an odd number of divisors. 

To approach this problem, we can start by writing a helper function that checks if a given number is smart or not. This can be done by counting the number of divisors of the number. If the count is odd, then the number is smart.

Once we have the helper function, we can write the main function that finds the nth smart number. This can be done by iterating over numbers starting from 1, checking if each number is smart using the helper function, and keeping track of the count of smart numbers found so far. When the count reaches n, we return the current number.

Here's the Python function implementation:

```python
def is_smart(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            if i * i == n:
                count += 1

        return (""Yes""); 
    else: 
        return (""No""); ","Here's my internal reasoning:

The problem asks to write a function that checks if one root of a quadratic equation is twice the other. A quadratic equation is of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The roots of this equation can be found using the quadratic formula: (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. 

To check if one root is twice the other, we need to find the roots first and then compare them. However, this approach is not efficient because it involves complex calculations. 

A simpler approach would be to analyze the conditions under which one root is twice the other. Let's assume the roots are r and 2r. Then, the sum of the roots is -b/a = r + 2r = 3r, and the product of the roots is c/a = r * 2r = 2r^2. 

From these two equations, we can find the value of r as -b/3a and r = sqrt(c/2a). Equating these two values of r, we get -b/3a = sqrt(c/2a). Squaring both sides, we get b^2 = 18ac. 

So, the function should return True if b^2 equals 18ac, and False otherwise.

To find the lateral surface area of a cuboid, we need to calculate the area of all its sides excluding the top and bottom faces. A cuboid has 6 faces: top, bottom, left, right, front, and back. The lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of the left, right, front, and back faces. 

Let's denote the length, width, and height of the cuboid as l, w, and h, respectively. The area of the left and right faces is l*h, the area of the front face is w*h, and the area of the back face is also w*h.
