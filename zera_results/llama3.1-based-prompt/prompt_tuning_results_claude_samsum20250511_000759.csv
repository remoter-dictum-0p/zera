- Judith suggested checking The Home Depot for the orchid bark, as her mom buys planters there for her plants.

- Barney already ordered a replacement pot online, but forgot to order the orchid bark as well. He's hoping Home Depot carries it.

- He wants to replant the orchid properly before his mom returns so she doesn't get too upset, since the plant means a lot to her as an anniversary gift from Barney's dad.

- His friends are giving him a hard time about the situation in a friendly, joking way, but he seems sincerely concerned about fixing his mistake with the treasured orchid.
