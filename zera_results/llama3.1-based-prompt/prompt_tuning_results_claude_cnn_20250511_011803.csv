Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L. Garnett was unable to file a murder charge under state law, and he highlighted how the coroner found that the fetus didn't show any signs of life outside the womb, Garnett said. The victim, Michelle Wilkins, 26, who was seven months' pregnant, survived this month's attack, which occurred when she went to a Longmont home to buy baby clothes advertised for sale on Craigslist. ""Now, I understand that many in the community -- and heaven knows I've heard from a lot of them -- would like me to file homicide charges,"" Garnett told reporters. ""However, that is not possible under Colorado law without proof of live birth. A prosecutor cannot file murder charges when a baby who is killed has not lived outside the body of the mother. For similar reasons, I cannot bring charges of child abuse resulting in death,"" the district attorney said. The fetus' lungs never inflated, Garnett said. The fetus' exact cause of death, however, isn't immediately known and is expected to be revealed when the final autopsy report is released in six to eight weeks, he said. Wilkins and her partner, identified only as Dan, named the female fetus Aurora, the prosecutor said. Lane, 34, appeared briefly in a holding room during an initial court appearance Friday, but she didn't enter the courtroom. Her attorneys waived a formal reading of charges at the hearing, which occurred before the prosecutor's press conference. ""She could get a long sentence and very well could die in prison,"" the district attorney said about Lane, adding he couldn't immediately calculate the maximum number of years she faces if convicted of all counts. Lane was also charged with two counts of crime of violence, two counts of first-degree assault, and two counts of second-degree assault, Garnett said. Lane's next court date, a preliminary hearing, is May 5. She is being held on a $2 million bond. Earlier Friday, the Boulder County Coroner's Office said the fetus wasn't alive on its own after it was cut from Wilkins' womb. The female fetus didn't exhibit ""any signs of life outside of the womb, therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth,"" Coroner Emma R. Hall said in a statement. Friday's finding came a day after prosecutors indicated that Lane wouldn't face a murder charge in the March 18 assault. Wilkins was released from the hospital on Thursday, relatives said. The coroner's office performed an autopsy on the fetus and said Wilkins was 34 weeks pregnant. ""An autopsy has been completed,"" Hall said. ""At this time neither the autopsy or the investigation have provided any evidence that the baby exhibited any signs of life outside of the womb, therefore the circumstance is not being considered a live birth. No evidence of trauma or injuries were found on the body. ""Final autopsy results will be released once all testing and further studies are complete,"" Hall said. The coroner's finding apparently contradicts earlier claims made in police reports that the fetus ""gasped"" and that emergency room personnel described the fetus as viable. David Ridley, the 35-year-old husband of Dynel Lane, told police he found his wife ""covered in blood"" in the family home and later found ""a small baby lying in the bathtub,"" a Longmont police report said. ""He rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath,"" the report said. Ridley took the baby and his wife to the emergency room of Longmont United Hospital, and the hospital told police the baby ""would have been viable,"" the police report said. But on Friday, District Attorney Garnett said that Ridley altered his earlier statement to police. Without referring to Ridley by name, Garnett cited how media accounts took note of the police report and how a ""witness observed Aurora taking a gasping breath."" ""However, upon a more thorough examination of this witness by the Longmont Police Department, the witness clarified that Aurora was still and her mouth was open, but she was not breathing, which is consistent with medical evidence from the autopsy,"" Garnett told reporters. CNN's Amanda Watts contributed to this report.","D.A. acknowledges that some people demand a homicide charge .
""That is not possible under Colorado law without proof of live birth,"" he says .
Dynel Lane is held on $2 million bond in an attack on a seven-months' pregnant woman .","Based on the CNN report, here are the key points regarding the tragic case involving Dynel Lane and Michelle Wilkins:

- Dynel Lane, a former nurse's aide, was charged with attempting to commit first-degree murder, unlawful termination of pregnancy, and other charges for allegedly cutting the fetus from Michelle Wilkins' womb.

- Wilkins, who was 7 months pregnant, survived the attack after going to Lane's home to buy baby clothes advertised on Craigslist.

- The Boulder County District Attorney could not file murder charges because under Colorado law, there needs to be proof of a live birth for such charges. The coroner found no signs the fetus showed any life outside the womb.

- The fetus, a female named Aurora by Wilkins and her partner, did not have inflated lungs. The cause of death is pending the final autopsy report.

- Lane faces a potential long prison sentence if convicted on the charges filed against her, which include assault counts.

- Earlier reports that the fetus gasped for breath were contradicted after further examination of a witness's statement, which aligned with the medical evidence.

Users stay authenticated until they remove their Nymi and the electrical circuit is broke. The Nymi functions on a three-factor security system - the bracelet, a unique heartbeat and an Authorized Authentication Device (AAD), which is a smartphone or device registered with the app. When the Nymi authenticates a user it looks at the shape of their ECG wave, not their heart rate. It can therefore adjust to typical variations in heart rate, even if the wearer has an irregular ECG as a result of a medical condition. The product's site said: 'Nymi offers security without compromising convenience, putting you, and only you, in control of your identity. 'As you head out the door, you’ll be able to interact with the world around you through the power of simple gestures. 'With accurate and convenient authentication technology there is no end to the possibilities. 'The Nymi can replace everything from the PIN on your credit card to the account information on your gaming console without sacrificing security, privacy or convenience.'

The bank - owned by Lloyds Banking Group - said the technology  only works when worn by the account owner and the band has to be paired with the device being used to access the account. Lloyds recently updated its online banking app with a similar feature that pairs and recognises the phone or tablet it is being used on. This removes the need to enter the username, password and memorable information every time. Instead the app just asks for the latter. The Nymi bracelet can be pre-ordered for $79 (£50).

Three days after watching his team score three tries from 12 clean line breaks against Scotland, Catt bristled more at the suggestion something needs fixing than at any residual annoyance at the raft of chances that went begging at Twickenham. With 11 tries in four RBS 6 Nations games so far — and France to come on Saturday in a game that could see England break their run of three successive runners-up finishes by winning the championship — Catt believes they are not being given enough credit for a sustained intent to keep the ball in hand while others prefer to look skywards in hope. England coach Mike Catt wants England to be more ruthless when it comes to scoring points . ‘Ninety-nine per cent of the things were very good,’ said the World Cup winner turned skills coach. ‘Obviously not transferring the stuff we created into points was something we were all very frustrated with. ‘At international level, the guys have to understand you only have two or three opportunities. You might not get five or six like we had on the weekend. ‘We need to make sure we convert those into points. The players are more frustrated than anybody but we are not going to throw anything out with the bath water. It is all about us sticking to what we are doing, because it is working.’ Stuart Lancaster looks on as his England side prepares for Saturday's crucial clash with France . Northampton Saints flanker Calum Clark will want to see some action during the crucial Six Nations clash . With three wins from four games and a small points advantage over nearest challengers Ireland, it is hard to argue, even considering their no-show in Dublin. England’s build-up play was, at times, exceptional against Scotland, even if their decision-making with the try line in view bordered on the dim-witted. Stuart Lancaster names his side to face France on Thursday, when Leicester duo Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up for the first time in this championship. The French made countless errors in dispatching Italy on Sunday and will have just six days to rest up for their final match, which kicks off last at 5pm and will see England knowing what is required to deliver the first notable piece of silverware of Lancaster’s reign. Jonathan Joseph and George Ford must be at their creative best to defeat a strong-tackling French midfield . England’s players watched helplessly hours after thrashing Italy as Ireland narrowly beat France in the final game last season to snatch the title from their grasp. Many believe the staggered kick-off times to suit television undermine the tournament. Catt added: ‘We don’t control it. It’s very tough because international matches are brutal. And when you are travelling a lot of the time, that can take three days out of your preparation time and recovery. It impedes you a bit.’ England will take comfort from knowing if Ireland run up a big score against Scotland to leave them needing to chase the game against France, they have stumbled upon a backline capable of cutting teams to ribbons. VIDEO Robshaw sets sights on France following Scotland win . England practice their scrummaging during the training session ahead of their upcoming physical battle . Jonathan Joseph, playing because of injuries to Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt at the start of the tournament, has been a revelation. He is the championship’s leading try-scorer with four in four games and, at 23, looks to the manner born. His performances at outside centre have been so good he is now regularly compared to the prince of English centres Jeremy Guscott, and the Bath three- quarter is confident of England’s chances, despite Saturday’s missed opportunities. Captain Chris Robshaw knows his side face a tough test against the French if they want to claim a crucial win . England duo Richard Wigglesworth (left) and Robshaw will be hoping they can lift the coveted trophy . ‘It was frustrating and a lot of negatives have been drawn from that game (Scotland), but as a team we created a lot,’ he said. ‘We feel we have come on massively in terms of putting defences under stress. ‘We’re happy with what we have created. Now it is just a case of doing the last bit. The easier bit is the finishing. It’s something we’ll work on. I don’t think there is any need to panic.’ VIDEO England v Scotland - extended highlights . Mike Brown, who missed games because of injury, is a vital player for England and his return is a real boost .","England can break their run of three successive runners-up finishes .

Geoff Parling and Tom Youngs appear certain to be in the line-up .","Here are a few key points from the article:

- Mike Catt, England's attacking skills coach, is frustrated that England didn't convert more of their chances into points against Scotland, but overall he is pleased with England's attacking intent and feels they are creating good opportunities.

- Catt wants England to be more clinical in taking their chances, as they may only get 2-3 opportunities per game at the international level.

- England have scored 11 tries in 4 Six Nations games so far, showing their attacking potency, but there is still room for improvement in execution.

- Jonathan Joseph has been a standout at outside center, leading the tournament with 4 tries so far and drawing comparisons to Jeremy Guscott.

- England are well-positioned for a potential Six Nations title with 3 wins from 4 games going into the final match against France.

- The staggered kickoff times are seen as disruptive to preparation, but England cannot control that.

- There is confidence in the England camp about their attacking abilities, they just need to be more ruthless in taking their scoring opportunities against France.

In summary, while not completely satisfied, Catt sees plenty of positives in England's attack and believes they have the firepower to potentially win the Six Nations if they can be more clinical against France.",0.49545454545454554,You are a helpful AI assistant.,Hello!

Afghanistan veteran Edward Keteca told service police he had heard Gunner Gary Doyle say 'something derogatory' about his wife Aimee as they walked home from an officer's mess party. The court heard that the 35-year-old then hit a female colleague who had attempted to break up the resulting drunken brawl at Larkhill Royal Artillery Barracks near Salisbury, in Wiltshire. Afghanistan veteran Edward Keteca (pictured leaving court with his wife Aimee) told service police he heard a fellow soldier call Mrs Keteca fat . Sgt Keteca claimed he had been worried the Gnr Doyle and the 'prominent bunch' of soldiers who had been out drinking with him in nearby Amesbury until 1.30am, might do something to his wife. He said: 'He (Gnr Doyle) turned and said something derogatory about my wife so we exchanged words on that. 'Until today I keep trying to remember what he said to me but he did say something to me because we stood there exchanging words. 'That's when the scuffle started. Words had been said and that's all led to one thing after another.' Sgt Ketaca claimed had heard Gunner Gary Doyle (pictured) call his wife fat and the two became involved in a drunken brawl . Bulford Military Court Centre heard that Gnr Doyle's comrades Gnr Samantha Palmer and Bombardier Andrew Radford had attempted to break up the drunken scuffle. After he being pulled away from Gnr Doyle, the court was told that Sgt Keteca had floored Gnr Palmer, 26, who got back up and told him: 'I'm a girl. You've just hit me.' The female gunner had to be taken to hospital the next day for treatment of a swollen eye. But the sergeant claimed he had struck her in self-defense after the 6ft tall, 17 stone rugby player grabbed his shoulders from behind. He told the court martial he punched her to free himself without realising she was a female. He said: 'I do accept making contact with the person coming from behind and I feel bad. 'I wasn't really sure what his intentions were - female or male. 'I was thinking about safety to myself and because I had my wife there as well. Who's to say they wouldn't do something to my wife?' Sgt Keteca's wife of six years Aimee, 29, added that the main aggressors in the incident on February 22 last year were the other soldiers. The mother-of-two said: 'The men jumped on my husband and they got involved in fisticuffs. 'My husband was being kicked the c*** out of on the ground. 'I was quite upset and I was thinking 'what's going to happen to my husband?' He was on the ground being kicked and punched. 'My husband was defending himself. He had men kicking and punching him and he was doing what any normal person would do.' Sgt and Mrs Keteca were described as a 'calm, happy couple' by comrades who knew them at Larkhill for over a year, who also labelled Sgt Keteca 'professional, reliable and highly respected'. Under cross examination, Gnr Doyle admitted describing Mrs Keteca as 'large' but denied calling her 'fat' or anything on the night of the incident. Gnr Doyle, of the 101 Regiment Royal Artillery, said: 'I never spoke no words. He just lunged towards me and I thought 'hang on'. 'He struck me a few times and I put my hands up to defend myself and we got into a big of a scuffle. 'I ended up falling over as he's hit me.' Gnr Doyle's comrades Gnr Samantha Palmer and Bombardier Andrew Radford (pictured) had attempted to break up the fight . Afghanistan veteran Edward Keteca (left) told service police he heard a fellow soldier say 'something derogatory' about his wife Aimee (right) as they left an officer's mess party . He added: 'It was a bit pathetic - it was just two drunken men.' Gnr Palmer - now a Lance Bombardier in the 265 Battery - had cried as she recalled being hit for the first time in her life. She told the court martial: 'People have a choice in life and I have never hit anybody so why should anybody hit me?' L Bdr Palmer, who denied making  derogatory remarks about Mrs Keteca, said the sergeant had thrown 'sloppy' and 'drunken' punches at Bdr Radford once he had also stepped in. She added that the case would never have come to court had she received an apology over the incident. 'One little apology and the person's career wouldn't be on the line,' she said. The drunken brawl happened at Larkhill Royal Artillery Barracks near Salisbury, in Wiltshire (pictured) Sgt Keteca always accepted he hit Gnr Palmer but but denied affray on the grounds of self defence. Today he was cleared by a board of three officers who deliberated for a little over an hour and joked with his defence barristers about sharing a bottle of champagne with his wife to celebrate. Sgt Keteca, of the 14th Regiment Royal Artillery, declined to make any further comment outside court.","Sgt Edward Keteca had been cleared of attacking two of his fellow soldiers .

Sgt Keteca then hit colleague Gnr Samantha Palmer who tried to intervene .","Based on the details provided, it seems this was an unfortunate incident stemming from a misunderstanding and drunken altercation between soldiers. Here are a few key points:

- Sergeant Edward Keteca claimed he heard Gunner Gary Doyle make a derogatory comment about his wife's weight, which sparked an argument and physical fight between them.

- In the ensuing scuffle, Sgt. Keteca struck a female soldier, Gunner Samantha Palmer, who tried to break it up. He claimed he hit her in self-defense without realizing she was a woman.

- Gunner Doyle admitted calling Sgt. Keteca's wife ""large"" but denied using the word ""fat."" 

- Sgt. Keteca was cleared of charges related to the altercation by a court martial, likely because he acted in perceived self-defense during a drunken brawl after the alleged insult to his wife.

- His wife Aimee supported his account that the other soldiers were the main aggressors.

While drunken fights and insults are unbecoming of soldiers, it appears the court accepted Sgt. Keteca's claim that he reacted after hearing a derogatory remark about his wife and acted defensively when others got physically involved.

But today turning 40, is no longer a harbinger of middle age but for many it's just another phase of our ever extending youth with all the anxieties of opportunities not taken and plans left undone. Here three generations of women discuss how they felt about the big 4-0, and how society's view of women as they age has changed for the better over their lifetimes. Sarah (top right) with her mother Helen (left), grandmother Mollie (centre) and one-year-old daughter Matilda, pose for a family selfie. The 39-year-old says talking to her mother and grandmother about turning 40 has helped her feel less downhearted about ageing, going grey and being more critical of her appearance . Sarah, right, with her mother Helen Ivens and one-year-old daughter Matilda . THE GRANDMOTHER . Mollie Guillaume, 87, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex with her sister, Joan, 84. She says: . 'Back then, once a woman turned 40 she was expected to dress in a more subdued way, get a shorter haircut and generally become quite staid in appearance. 'Nowadays of course it seems like anything goes on the wardrobe front until you die - I see some old biddies these days who look ridiculous, showing off their scrawny legs in clothes meant for teenagers and coated in thick, gaudy make-up. 'I've always liked wearing tailored, comfortable clothes in flattering colours so my appearance hasn't changed too much from birthday to birthday. 'I don't like the idea of getting older; I don't feel 87. But I've always eaten carefully, kept active, travelled the world and spent quality time with my family and friends - and I have my health after getting cancer in my 50s - so instead of moaning about it I just feel very, very lucky I'm still here. 'My daughter Helen looks in the mirror and can't believe there's an old woman staring back at her, but I'm used to it so it's not a shock for me any more. 'As my granddaughter hits 40, she should really be thinking ""I'm halfway done now, if I'm lucky, so let's enjoy this life!"" Four generations together: From left to right, Helen Ivens, mum Mollie Guillaume and Sarah with her son William, who's now three . THE MOTHER . Helen Ivens, 65, is retired and lives in Chigwell, Essex, with her husband Keith, 66. 'I didn't want a big party for my 40th birthday, so my husband took me for a romantic weekend in a Paris, without the children, who were 14, eight and two at the time. 'But I wasn't depressed. In fact I remember feeling happier than I ever had in my life. Turning 40 coincided with a great sense of relief that my life was stable and on an even keel after a difficult first half. 'In fact 40 was a great turning point for me, and it's been good ever since. 'The catchphrase at the time - on cards, badges and banners - was Forty and Over the Hill, so I was quite surprised, as the big day loomed, how not elderly I felt. 'When I was a teen, when someone turned 40 I considered them very much past it and on the verge of old age. But physically I looked and felt okay. 'I had a big Charlie's Angels perm and a penchant for shoulder pads and fuschia, but that was the style of the time. My daughter thinks I look better now. 'In the 1980s, when I turned 40, I was definitely the oldest mum at the school gates. The other fortysomethings waiting there were grandmas. Helen Ivens, now 65, with her daughter Sarah, who is about to turn 40, on holiday in the Cotswolds last year. Helen says that when she turned 40 in the 1980s, it felt like a new phase of her life was beginning, 'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life' Helen Ivens, centre, aged 40 with her children, from left:  James, William (sitting on her lap) and Sarah . 'But of course this is all different now, and my daughter Sarah is not unusual that she is turning 40 with a one-year-old daughter. 'Having a daughter who is turning 40 is quite a milestone for me. In fact, it's a bigger shock to the system than when I turned 40. 'In my head I still feel about 38, so to have a child of 40 is a startling reality check. But I'm excited for her to reach this landmark age. 'If you have good health and enough money to be comfortable, it can be a great phase of your life. In fact, in a way, life begins at 40. Helen Ivens holds her new granddaughter, Sarah's second child Matilda . THE DAUGHTER . Sarah Ivens, 39, lives in London with her husband Russell and children William, three, and Matilda, one. 'My dad recently told me that 60 is the new 40, so 40 must be the new 20. I think he was trying to cheer me up but I just thought ""Oh please no, I haven't got the energy to live my 20s again!"" 'But I think that has more to do with having two young children than the amount of candles I'm about to blow out on my birthday cake. 'It's been very reassuring to talk to my mother and grandmother about turning 40 though because I have been surprised at how downhearted it's made me feel. 'I feel a real sense of loss, about things gone by, opportunities not taken. I feel like I get to turn a giant egg timer over once more and then that's it. I'm half way done. 'But as my sensible grandma said to me ""darling, the alternative to turning 40 is much worse so just get on with it."" Mollie (second from right), with her daughter Helen (far left), sister Joan and granddaughter Sarah (far right) says when she turned 40 in 1968 women were expected to dress conservatively and become quite staid in appearance with a shorter haircut, despite the women's liberation movement sweeping across Britain . 'I've never paid much attention to my appearance but suddenly I'm studying everything in cruel, minute detail. 'In the last year I've gone quite grey and I've started to notice wrinkles and lines that I don't think were there before. They may have been of course, but I just wasn't looking for them. And I just don't feel as bouncy. 'My body definitely takes longer to recover after exercise, and that extra slice of pizza will now puff out the tummy that once stayed resolutely flat. 'Most of my friends have already turned 40 and I've noticed the trend to throw parties as big as weddings in a giant celebration of yourself. 'I love going to these things because you really see how far people have come. I normally get quite overwhelmed with emotion. 'My mum said she thinks me and all my friends, many of whom she's known for over 20 years, look better now than we ever have. I don't think she's just saying that. 'I think along with added wrinkles, we've added confidence - and certainly we're making better make-up and hairstyle choices.'","Mollie Guillaume, 87, turned 40 in 1968 as women's lib swept Britain .
Her daughter Helen Ivens, now 65, hit the milestone birthday in the Eighties .
As granddaughter Sarah turns 40 the women compare their experiences .","Here are a few key points I gathered from the perspectives shared by the three generations of women about turning 40:

The Grandmother (Mollie, 87):
- When she was younger, women were expected to dress more conservatively and subdued after 40
- She doesn't like the idea of getting older, but has accepted it gracefully by living an active, healthy life
- She advises her granddaughter to enjoy life after 40 since she's potentially halfway through

The Mother (Helen, 65):
- Turning 40 was a great relief and positive turning point in her life after some difficulties
- It didn't make her feel old, contrary to expectations when she was younger
- Having a daughter turn 40 is more of a shock, as a reality check of her own age
- But she's excited for her daughter and sees 40 as the start of a new great phase

The Daughter (Sarah, 39):
- She feels downhearted about opportunities missed and being ""halfway done"" 
- She is newly critical of her aging appearance like graying hair and wrinkles
- But talking to her mom and grandma has been reassuring about embracing this stage
- Her friends seem to be celebrating 40 as a major milestone with big parties

Dawn Jackson has warned others not to leave phone chargers plugged in after a blaze at her home in Derby . All of Ms Jackson's three dogs - Labradors Marley and Riley (pictured) and the whippet-cross Dylan - died .

I want to warn people, and highlight the dangers of using extension leads. 'The main cause of the fire was the phone charger in the extension lead. This has been a wake-up call - we'll never leave anything plugged in while we're out again.'

1) Never leave phone chargers or electrical devices plugged in and unattended when leaving the house. Unplug them to prevent fires from faulty wiring or overheating.

2) Be very cautious about using extension leads with multiple outlets - don't overload them.

3) Install working smoke alarms on every level of your home and test them regularly. Early detection is crucial.

4) Keep pets safely confined when leaving them home alone to prevent tragedies.

The massively popular superhero entertainment factory has the third ""Captain America"" movie on the way, ""Civil War,"" which will include Iron Man and quite possibly, the new Spider-Man. It's based on a story arc from almost a decade ago, which tackled issues of freedom versus security, with the two heroes going toe to toe against one another. This summer, Marvel plans to revisit that storyline as part of the much larger return of ""Secret Wars,"" its biggest crossover event of the 1980s. The effects of this will be huge to the comics, ending 33 of the company's titles. CNN spoke to writer Charles Soule, who has gained acclaim for his work on ""Superman/Wonder Woman,"" ""Swamp Thing,"" The Death of Wolverine,"" ""She-Hulk"" and more. He gave us the scoop on the return of ""Civil War,"" one year before it hits the big screen. CNN: What can fans expect from your ""Civil War"" storyline? Soule: ""Secret Wars"" is an opportunity to revisit some of the great Marvel stories of the past. One of those is ""Civil War,"" and I got the call to work on that. ""Civil War"" happened in 2006 and 2007, and in that story Captain America and Iron Man went after each other based on an ideological difference on superheroes in the world. What I'm doing is taking that story in a different direction. CNN: Will this be a way for those who are interested in the upcoming movie to dive into that story? Soule: Absolutely. If you look at the ideas that that story had, Iron Man thought superheroes should have to register with the government, and become something of a police force. Captain America thought that that was restricting the central freedoms of this country. It was a debate of security versus freedom. We're taking that basic idea and expanding it to a larger canvas. The Registration Act is all in the past at this point. It's more of a world drastically changed based on a superhero war, and it's a huge story and it's fun to be able to involve every Marvel character there is. CNN: Is this one of the biggest stories you've worked on? Soule: I've been on big books but this one feels huge. It affects every character in one way or another, and it deals with some central issues to the modern world. That's not always something you get to do in a Marvel story. CNN: So this will have many twists and turns away from the original story? Soule: The idea is to take some of the events in the original storyline and spin them off into entirely new stories. Without spoiling, this deals with a world that has been ravaged for quite some time when we pick up the story. I felt the original ""Civil War"" explored those questions very well. If I was going to play in this sandbox, I wanted to ask my own questions.","This summer, the popular 1980s ""Secret War"" comic book storyline will return .
Story will affect every Marvel comic, ending 33 titles .
2000s ""Civil War"" story will also be revisiting, pitting characters against each other .","Here are a few key points about Marvel's upcoming ""Civil War"" comic book storyline tied to the upcoming Captain America movie:

- It is revisiting the classic 2006-2007 ""Civil War"" storyline where Captain America and Iron Man were divided over the issue of superhero registration with the government. This ideological conflict split the Marvel heroes into two sides.

- Writer Charles Soule is putting a new spin on the ""Civil War"" concept, depicting a world that has already been ravaged by a superhero war over the registration issue. It explores the aftermath rather than just retelling the original story.

- Soule says it allows him to involve all the major Marvel characters and ask new questions related to security vs freedom that are relevant to modern times, rather than just following the original storyline.

- It ties into the huge ""Secret Wars"" crossover event that is ending several Marvel comic series, allowing Soule to take the ""Civil War"" story in an entirely new direction on a bigger canvas.

- While inspired by the original, it seems designed to differentiate itself enough to be fresh material, not just a straight adaptation of the 2006 comics in preparation for the movies.

So in summary, it's using the popular ""Civil War"" concept as a launching point to tell a new, bigger Marvel story about a post-superhero war world for the comics universe. This gives Soule creative freedom while still tying into the hype for the upcoming film.",0.8550000000000001,You are a helpful AI assistant.,Hello!

The Black Cats have managed only 23 goals in their 28 Barclays Premier League fixtures to date this season, a return which has left them perched perilously close to the relegation zone as the season reaches crunch-point. Perhaps even more worrying is the fact that Gus Poyet's pool of frontmen has contributed just nine of those goals, a record Wickham knows simply has to improve if they are to avoid a second successive scramble for top-flight survival. Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe has only managed two goals since his January arrival from FC Toronto . 'I wouldn't say the criticism of the strikers is unfair,' admitted Wickham, speaking to the Northern Echo. 'Strikers are going to get the most at any club because they are the money-makers, they are the ones that the fans are relying on to score the goals. That's where the criticism can come. 'Chances come and you do need to put them away. We are creating chances. The way we set up, we are setting up to attack at times when we get the ball. We do try to break as quickly as we can when we get the ball. Connor Wickham, who has scored just three league goals this season, says Sunderland attack must do better . Wickham, 21, scored one of his three Premier League strikes this term against champions Manchester City . 'We have done it in games but we have to get more consistent with it and get in to the box more. We will climb away from the rest of the group down there if we can start to put our chances away.' Scotland international Steven Fletcher is currently leading the way for the strikers with four goals - the same number as midfielder Adam Johnson - with Wickham having managed three and January arrival Jermain Defoe two. Danny Graham is yet to score for the club, while Jozy Altidore, who left the Stadium of Light for Toronto in an exchange deal with Defoe in January, did so having found the back of the net just three times in 52 appearances in all competitions. Sunderland face Aston Villa - the only Premier League club to have scored fewer goals with just 15 to date - at the Stadium of Light on Saturday with three points crucial for both sides. Villa, who ended a run of seven league defeats on the trot with a 2-1 home victory over derby rivals West Brom on March 3, currently sit three points clear of the bottom three with their hosts a point better off.

- Sunderland's strikers have only scored 9 of the team's 23 Premier League goals this season, which is a poor return.

- Connor Wickham admits the criticism the strikers are facing is fair, as goalscorers are relied upon to produce goals.

- Wickham says the strikers need to be more clinical and put away the chances they are creating.

- Jermain Defoe has only scored 2 goals since joining in January from Toronto FC.

- Steven Fletcher is Sunderland's top scorer in the league with 4 goals, the same as midfielder Adam Johnson.

- Wickham and Defoe are the only other Sunderland strikers to have scored in the league this season with 3 and 2 goals respectively.

- The poor goalscoring record of the strikers is a major reason why Sunderland are hovering dangerously close to the relegation zone.

- Their upcoming match against Aston Villa, the league's lowest scorers, is crucial for both clubs in their fight for survival.

Claire Perry said many women found it a real struggle to shift the pounds while raising small children and needed incentives to ‘motivate’ them. But she rejected calls for sanctions on people who are overweight. Her remarks come just weeks after the Prime Minister called for people who are too fat to work to be stripped of their benefits if they refuse to go on weight-loss regimes. Scroll down for video . Tory minister Claire Perry said many women found it a real struggle to shift the pounds while raising small children . However, Mrs Perry said she ‘preferred to see incentives’ rather than taking people’s benefits away. She said: ‘If it was all about willpower I would weigh eight stone. We live in a world where dietary advice is incredibly confusing, every week we read it’s carbs, it’s not carbs, it’s fat, it’s starvation – whatever it is. ‘People are busy, running around looking after their children. Everybody would like to be slimmer and healthier. What our welfare system could do is encourage people to make those choices.’ Mrs Perry added: ‘I’d prefer to see real incentives for people to get healthy, get more active. We know that increased exercise is associated with increased mental health. ‘I think for many women who are struggling having to lose weight after children it is a real problem and anything we can do to motivate people and give incentives to do. I prefer to focus on carrots for healthy choice rather than sticks.’ The transport minister’s intervention comes after Mr Cameron said people who cannot work because they are too fat – or addicted to drugs or alcohol – should have their benefits cut if they refuse to get treatment. Mrs Perry, appearing on the Daily Politics show today, said she ‘preferred to see incentives’ to encourage people to lose weight rather than taking people’s benefits away . Almost 2,000 people are registered as long-term sick because of obesity. Ministers are considering forcing them to go on a diet or lose their benefits . The proposed overhaul of the benefits system could save Britain £500million a year in sickness payments. The Prime Minister has asked a government health adviser to ‘rapidly’ review the Conservatives’ plans. Speaking last month, he said: ‘Too many people are stuck on sickness benefits because of issues that could be addressed but instead are not.’ Under one plan being looked at, almost 2,000 people registered as long-term sick because of obesity would face having their benefits docked unless they agreed to lose weight. Around 56,000 people on the register say their primary condition is alcoholism. Almost 34,000 cite drug dependency. On average these 90,000 people get about £100 a week in sickness benefits and are entitled to other payments, such as housing and council tax benefits. They are already offered treatment, such as courses and medication, to kick their habit and get back to work. But there is no legal requirement to accept the help. Mr Cameron’s plan has been attacked by senior Tories. Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the influential Commons Health Committee, said she was 'infuriated' by the 'illegal and unworkable' proposal, announced last month.","Claire Perry said many women found it a real struggle to shift the pounds .

The state's Department of Motor Vehicles says nearly 877,000 vehicles among more than 19million cars, pickup trucks and motorcycles registered in Texas carry a specialty plate. But a state motor vehicle board turned down a request by the Texas division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans for a license plate with its logo bearing the battle flag, similar to plates issued by eight other states that were members of the Confederacy, as well as Maryland. Pictured above is the design of a proposed Sons of Confederate Veterans license plate.  The Supreme Court will weigh a free-speech challenge to Texas's decision to refuse to issue a license plate bearing the Confederate battle flag . The justices are hearing arguments on Monday over whether the state violated the group's First Amendment rights.

The First Amendment dispute has brought together some unlikely allies, including the American Civil Liberties Union, anti-abortion groups, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, civil libertarian Nat Hentoff and conservative satirist P.J. O'Rourke. 'In a free society, offensive speech should not just be tolerated, its regular presence should be celebrated as a symbol of democratic health — however odorous the products of a democracy may be,' Hentoff, O'Rourke and others said in a brief backing the group. Sons of the Confederate Veterans claim that Texas is violating the group's First Amendment right of freedom of speech by not allowing them to have their logo, bearing the battle flag, on license places (file photo) The case could be important for how the Supreme Court determines whether the speech at issue belongs to private individuals or the government. Texas's main argument to the Supreme Court is that the license plate is not like a bumper sticker slapped on the car by its driver. Instead, the state said license plates are government property, and so what appears on them is not private individuals' speech but the government's. The First Amendment applies when governments try to regulate the speech of others, but not when governments are doing the talking. Sons of Confederate Veterans claim on the group's website that it  'is preserving the history and legacy of these heroes so that future generations can understand the motives that animated the Southern Cause' Even if the court disagrees that license plates are government speech, the state said its rejection of the Sons of Confederate Veterans license plate was not discriminatory. The motor vehicle board had not approved a plate denigrating the Confederacy or the battle flag so it could not be accused of giving voice to one viewpoint while suppressing another, the state said. The ACLU suggested the court view license plates as a mix of private and government speech. For example, drivers who seek a personal touch and buy the specialized plates know the government has approved their issuance. Eleven states are supporting Texas because they fear that a ruling against the state would call into question license plates that promote national and state pride and specific positions on such controversial issues as abortion. A decision in Walker v. Sons of Confederate Veterans, 14-144, is expected by late June.","Drivers spent $17.6million last year to choose from among more than 350 messages the state allows .

- The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether Texas violated the free speech rights of the Sons of Confederate Veterans group by refusing to issue license plates featuring the Confederate battle flag.

- Texas allows over 350 specialty license plate designs, which brought in $17.6 million in revenue last year, but rejected the Confederate group's proposed plate design featuring their logo with the battle flag emblem.

- The case hinges on whether license plate designs represent private speech (which would be protected by the First Amendment) or government speech (which the state can control).

- Texas argues that license plates are government property and what appears on them is the government's speech, not private individuals' speech.

- The Sons of Confederate Veterans group claims the license plate denial violates their First Amendment free speech rights.

- The case has drawn support for the Confederate group from unexpected allies like the ACLU and anti-abortion groups, who argue that offensive speech should be tolerated in a free society.

- Eleven states have backed Texas, fearing a ruling against the state could threaten their own specialty license plate programs promoting state pride or controversial issues.

- A decision in the case is expected by late June 2015.",0.82,"Analyze the given text thoroughly to extract essential information.

The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. ""They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old,"" Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. ""They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people,"" Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. ""I only got information of the attack on my village last night,"" said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba ""lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri.""","Young victims in the village of Njaba, ages 13 to 19 were singled out for killing, witness says .

Lauren Searle, 17, visited Egypt with her family for eight days and mistakenly thought she had a £120 limit on her contract with O2. But when the shop worker, from Bridgwater, Somerset, returned home she was horrified when her mother Sharon - whose name was on the contract - received a £4,908.69 bill. Distraught Lauren - whose family can't afford the repayments - felt so guilty about the bill she went to the doctors and was prescribed anti-depressants. Lauren Searle, 17, pictured with her mother Sharon Searle, after she ran up a £5,000 phone bill in Egypt . Mother Mrs Searle, 51, said: 'My daughter has had to go on anti-depressants since she got the bill. It has really affected her. 'She's been really upset. She didn't realise that this was happening. The contract is in my name and she feels guilty. 'You don't expect your 17-year-old daughter to be on anti-depressants. 'Lauren is really worried that we won't be able to pay it back and the bailiffs will be round. 'They said we can pay £100 a month. That is too much. We can't afford it. We could maybe afford £50, but that would take years. I think they could do more. 'I don't know what to do. I've cried, I've been angry. What the hell will I do? The family flew to Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, for a Christmas holiday on December 22 and Lauren thought she was using the hotel Wifi to keep in touch with friends on Facebook. She was sent a text asking if she wanted to increase her bill limit to £120 - or 200mb of data - and she agreed. The family headed to Sharm El Sheik, Egypt for a Christmas holiday and Lauren chatted with her friends . Lauren, pictured with her mother and her mother's partner Leigh (right), thought her bill was capped at £120 . But when she got a second text later to say she had reached that limit, she agreed to remove the data restriction, mistakenly thinking she still couldn't go above £120. She thought the bill would be more than covered by the £200 she set aside before her holiday, so was astonished to return home to a £3,704.34 bill on January 2. However, not all data she used on her iPhone 6 to browse the web and Facebook was included in the first bill, and it was upped to £4,908.69 on February 27. Lauren is now taking anti-depressant citalopram every day and is nervous the bill will tear the family apart. Mrs Searle, an administrator, who was on holiday with her partner and his son, added: 'If I had known I would have told her to stop. Lauren thought she was still within the £120. She had no idea. 'I just got an email to say the bill was £3704.34. I was so shocked. 'They put it up in February. They said they hadn't included everything in the January bill. When I rang in January saying I needed help they said 'unlucky'. 'I was ringing them every day. How do you bill for something in January and then again in February?' She had set aside £200 for her bill while she was abroad, but the family now face years of paying it off . Since the huge bill was sent, O2 has slightly dropped the cost to £3,191.97 as a gesture of goodwill. A company spokesperson said: 'To help protect customers from higher costs charged by overseas networks we cap data usage at £40. 'Customers need to tell us if they want to increase this limit and confirm to us again if they want the cap removed completely. 'We received two separate notifications from Ms Searle's mobile asking us to do just that. 'We are clear with customers on the cost of overseas charges and would always advise customers to think carefully before choosing to remove the usage caps.'","17-year-old used phone while on  holiday to chat with friends back home .

Prioritize factual correctness over strict length constraints.",5,"Manchester City and Chelsea are set to challenge Manchester United for the services of Gareth Bale this summer. The pressure on Bale at Madrid has intensified in recent weeks and a move back to the Premier League is on the cards. It has been assumed that if Bale does leave Madrid then a move to United is a 'shoo-in'. But both Chelsea and City are in need of attacking stimulus, especially in the context of Champions League football. Gareth Bale is attracting criticism in the Spanish capital and Chelsea and Manchester City are interested . The reality is that it will be how each club manage to finance a £100million deal plus near £300,000-a-week wages and stay within FFP rules. And in the case of Manchester United they have priorities in other areas of the pitch. Chelsea, on the basis of transfer sales and turnover, will have the ability to push the boat out to get Bale. The Blues are also looking to sign Real Madrid centre-half Raphael Varane. Chelsea could demand as much as £20million this summer to let Petr Cech leave the club. In what may well be a merry-go-round of elite goalkeepers this summer, Cech is a target for Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Manchester United, Real Madrid and PSG. Although Cech is now Chelsea’s No 2, he is still just 32. Former Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann has urged the Gunners to sign Cech, arguing that he could well be entering the best period of his career. Petr Cech is wanted by a raft of top clubs and Arsenal have been urged to sign him by Jens Lehmann . Liverpool are prepared to play poker with Raheem Sterling and his advisors over a new contract. And the Merseyside club remain convinced they will win. The Reds don’t believe there is genuine, firm interest from clubs such as Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Chelsea or Manchester United as has been reported, as talks over a new £100,000 a week deal have repeatedly stalled. Certainly Liverpool believe that if they slap a £50million-plus price tag on the England forward then none of those clubs would make a move this summer. Raheem Sterling is reportedly wanted by Europe's elite, but Liverpool aren't buying that . Talks on a bumper £1000,000-a-week deal have stalled between Sterling and Liverpool . Indeed the club believe Sterling constantly being linked with a range of 'platinum' clubs is part of a strategy from the player’s camp to force their hand and offer wages of up to £140,000 a week - the sort of level Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez were on. But the view of the Liverpool hierarchy is that in stages of progression Sterling does not yet command such a figure in the context of their wage structure nor in how they deal with FFP regulations. The club want Sterling to understand that the current offer is generous, especially given that despite his rapid emergence he has yet to prove himself as a consistent force, and that a new £100,000-a-week five-year deal would have re-negotiation stages built in. The obvious concern of the club is that if they bow to the demands of Sterling’s advisors now, they could have a talented 20-year-old player on their hands who suddenly lacks sufficient motivation and incentive to fulfil his potential. Brendan Rodgers bluntly told Sterling not to wave goodbye to Liverpool . It was telling that manager Brendan Rodgers said pointedly on Saturday: ‘I think it is quite obvious when you look at it is that anyone with his [Sterling’s] best interests at heart knows his best option is to sign a new deal for Liverpool.’ The club also doesn’t want to unsettle the rest of the squad by bowing to Sterling's demands. Liverpool are also relaxed about the situation not least because Sterling’s current contract does not expire until the summer of 2017. Sam Allardyce's days are numbered as West Ham manager. The club are set to sever his contract on May 25, the day after the last game of the season against Newcastle. Even if the Hammers have a good end to the season there is no way back for Allardyce whose current contract expires in July. The 3-0 defeat at Arsenal took West Ham's Premier League run to just one win in 12. Sam Allardyce looks aggrieved during West Ham's latest capitulation at the Emirates . The West Ham board still harbour hopes of luring Carlos Tevez to the club next season from Juventus in their last season at the Boleyn Ground before moving to the Olympic Stadium. The club’s hierarchy see former cult hero Tevez as a platinum signing that can help attract a new fan base. Carlos Tevez is wanted by the Hammers as a marquee signing in their final year at Upton Park . Everton could move for Chelsea’s misfit striker Loic Remy this summer if they decide to cash in on wantaway Romelu Lukaku. Radamel Falcao, as revealed by the Football Grapevine, will not stay at Manchester United beyond this season’s loan deal from Monaco, where indeed the Colombian could well be playing his football again next season. Radamel Falcao could return to Monaco after a frustrating first year in the Premier League . I am hearing . Tottenham’s Danny Rose is set to get an England call-up for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania later this month to prevent him opting to declare for Jamaica. BTW . Luis Suarez last week claimed it was English media which forced him to quit Liverpool last summer and join Barcelona. Utter tosh. The main reason Suarez left Liverpool is because he had been hankering for a dream move to Spain for over a year. And he also wanted to nearly double his salary. Luis suarez looks glum as Liverpool's title hopes evaporate on a crazy night at Selhurst Park last year . Suarez grins from ear to ear as the Uruguayan is turning it on for La Liga leaders Barcelona . Yes the press reported various indiscretions by the Uruguayan, including a race row, a propensity to dive and a habit of assaulting opponents from time to time. That’s part of the job. What did Suarez expect? High fives? Or flowers? Yet for all that, the English press still honoured Suarez last season when the Football Writers Association (FWA) voted him as their player of the year. That’s hardly hounding a player out, is it? I-Say . Jamie Carragher labelled the behaviour of Chelsea players in Champions League defeat by PSG as a ‘disgrace’. Fellow Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness described the manner in which the Chelsea players pressurised referee Bjorn Kuipers to send off Zlatan Ibrahimovic as pathetic. Ibrahimovic called the Chelsea players ‘babies’. I can’t disagree with any of those verdicts. I just found it embarrassing. Yet in the commentary box, Gary Neville almost paid the Chelsea players a compliment by calling them ‘shrewd’. Really? Chelsea players surround Bjorn Kuipers as the Dutch official sends off Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Matches between Manchester United and Tottenham have often been entertaining and full of goals down the years, although this season’s encounter at White Hart Lane ended 0-0. Coral offer 12-1 on the same outcome. For the more adventurous, they offer 50-1 for 3-3. Harry Kane is 6-1 to be first scorer. Shrewd is being clever, not cheating then is it? Does an employee of the Football Association - Neville has a role as England boss Roy Hodgson’s assistant - advocate cheating? Let’s not forget one of the main roles of the FA is to act as custodians of the game, uphold discipline and even offer a moral lead. Once again there would seem a conflict of interest with Neville being an opinionated media pundit AND a senior member of the England coaching staff. After all, do we want to see England players acting in the same pathetic manner, as Souness put it, as the Chelsea players did last week? I think not.","Gareth Bale's suitors now include Chelsea and Manchester City .
Chelsea may put a £20m price tag on Petr Cech .
West Ham want a sensational reunion with Carlos Tevez .
Liverpool are convinced there is no interest from Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Chelsea or Manchester United in Sterling .

Police became aware of the 16-year-old student after his friends alerted school authorities about worrying texts he had sent them, with a search of his home finding explosives, blueprints of explosives and plans to carry out a mass killing at Edmond North High School. Charles Martin's son, Michael, is a freshman at the school, which has 2,437 students. But rather than feel anger toward the student and his plan, Mr Martin, a writer, said he felt compassionate. He subsequently penned a letter to the boy titled 'To The Teen Who Planned To Kill My Son'. Scroll down to read the letter . Sympathetic: Charles Martin wrote a letter to a 16-year-old Edmond North High School student who was caught allegedly plotting to stage a mass killing at the school where Mr Martin's son goes . 'Instead of mourning, my son, his brother, and I are going to have a long, happy spring break,' Mr Martin wrote in the letter about his son, Michael (right) Compassionate: The letter was posted to Facebook after Mr Matin's company website crashed from all the clicks it was receiving . The letter is an attempt to understand what the teen was going through as he planned the alleged attack. It questions whether the area's harsh winter had anything to do with it, and suggests he may have never intended to actually go through with the plan. Mr Martin believes he may have wanted to get caught. 'The first thought just goes back to what it’s like being a teenager,' Mr Martin told KFOR. 'It’s a brutal, brutal time. 'Even if what he was going to do was monstrous, he is a human being. 'I hope he can find his way back to something even close to normal, that he can just survive this hole that he’s in and find something better on the other side.' Writer: Charles Martin said the first thing he thought about after hearing of the alleged plot was how 'brutal' it is to be a teenager . Scene: The 16-year-old allegedly planned to set off explosives at Edmond North High School in Oklahoma . The student is now being treated at an in-patient treatment facility. He has not been charged, but may get convicted on possession of explosives charges. He will not be returning the school. Mr Martin owns a small publishing company, and posted the letter to his website, Literati Press. It quickly went viral, causing the site to crash. He then posted it to Facebook, where it continues to circulate.","Teen, 16, was caught Friday with alleged plot to go on a killing spree at Edmond North High School in Oklahoma, which has 2,437 students .

The attorney earlier indicated such a bail was probably higher than his client could post. Knight bent over in his chair at the defense table, with his attorney beside him, and two deputies rushed to him as he was facedown. Moments earlier, the judge ruled that Knight ""has a great potential to flee and apparently has so in the past."" ""In this court's opinion, $25 million is reasonable, and it is so set,"" said Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ronald S. Coen. Attorney Matthew Fletcher told CNN affiliate KABC that Knight hit his head on a chair and knocked himself out. Fletcher later saw Knight in the holding cell, and ""he was dripping sweat ... like somebody threw a bucket of water on him,"" Fletcher told the station. ""And he wiped the sweat off his head and said, 'I haven't had my medication,' and I said since when, and he said since yesterday. That's when I went back in and told the judge 'You need to make an order that he gets his medicine and he hasn't been fed' and the judge said, 'Well, they offered him food at some point today,' and I said well that's not what I've heard,"" Fletcher told the affiliate. Knight, who suffers from diabetes and blood clots, was taken to the hospital, the attorney said. Knight's condition was not immediately available. He has collapsed before while in custody. Knight has been held in solitary confinement, Fletcher added. When asked about the $25 million bail, Fletcher said, ""It's just laughable."" The bail in other prominent murder cases ""at most is $5 million,"" Fletcher told the affiliate. ""The heads of the Mafia, $5 million (bail),"" Fletcher said. Prosecutors sought the $25 million bail, he added. A preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 13. Knight, 49, has pleaded not guilty to several charges that accuse him of running over two men -- killing one of them -- in January after an argument. Knight is charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and two counts of hit-and-run, with an allegation that he committed a serious and violent felony while out on bail, prosecutors said. The man who died was Terry Carter, 55, a former rap record label owner. The second man is Cle ""Bone"" Sloan, 51. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. At the time of his most recent arrest, Knight was free on bail in a robbery case. CNN's Rosalina Nieves, Paul Vercammen, Carma Hassan and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","""It's just laughable,"" Knight's attorney says about high bail .

Custom additions like the shag pile  seat covers and floor rugs turned the vehicle into a 'personal pleasure machine' ideal for the drive-in movies. 'Suddenly your van becomes a personal pleasure machine ... and it won't turn into a pumpkin if you're not home by midnight.' 'Let the good times roll.' According to Mysandman.com.au, a website dedicated to the classic wagon, the Sandman was 'a warning to parents everywhere that your daughters were no longer safe going to the drive-ins.' Original posters for the Holden Sandman appealed to Australian's love of surf and the great outdoors . 'Built for new horizons:' The original Sandman panelvan  as it first appeared in Holden adverts . 'Make yours a Vroom:' The Freedom Machine as it was originally advertised by Holden . The Holden Sandman was advertised as care for the 'fun folk' with a little 'gypsy' in them . Peter Keley, Holden’s  Director of Sales,  says the opportunity to bring back the Sandman was irresistible. 'The Holden Sandman has been synonymous with the great Australian surf safari for decades and perfectly reflects our country’s laid back, yet adventurous attitude to life. When the opportunity came to revive Sandman, we jumped at it,' Mr Keley said. 'The reborn Sandman is a statement and reflection of the Australian way of life. Most importantly, it’s about having fun.' Kate Burling, a long-time fan of the Holden wagon, says she can't wait to see the new model. 'My  first love at 17 was my Holden Kingswood, then it was the pano,' Ms Burling told Daily Mail Australia. 'I never owned a Sandman but I just love it, it's such a classic car for the ultimate  aussie road trip, I can't wait to see what the new one looks like.' The HX Sandman panelvan was the ultimate surf mobile . After more than twenty years in the darkness, Holden reinvented the Sandman as a concept ute at the Sydney International Motor Show, 2000. But the ute was discontinued in 2006 due to slow sales. The 2015 Sandman launches on the heels of other recently revived Holden classics like the Collingwood Dore and Craig Lowndes, as the company tries to boost Commodore sales before it ends local production in 2017. Holden reinvented the Sandman as a concept van at the Sydney International Motor Show in 2000,  pictured here with Mambo artwork. The limited edition Sandman wagon will be unveiled at the Rip Curl Pro surf competition at Bells Beach in Victoria next weekend . Holden spokesman  Sean Poppitt says the new Sandman is sure to be a hit with Holden fans at Bells Beach next weekend. 'I’m sure it will spark great memories for a lot of Australians and help create new memories for others,' he says. 'Let the good times roll again.'","Holden has reinvented its classic '70s Sandman, the original 'shaggin' wagon'

In the aftermath of Chelsea's Champions League exit to Paris St Germain, former Liverpool manager and current Sky Sports pundit Souness was highly critical of them, referring to some of Chelsea's actions as 'pathetic'. He continued his complaints, with Mourinho responding in a press conference on Friday, calling the Scot a 'frustrated man'. Graeme Souness labelled Chelsea's gamesmanship during PSG defeat as 'pathetic' The Sky Sports pundit, pictured with Thierry Henry (right), has refused to back down over criticism . Using his hands to gesture, Mourinho raised his left hand above his head to illustrate Souness' high level as a player and whacked his left on a low desk to signify his own career. When it came to management, the Portuguese's right hand was raised high and his left, for Souness' management career, wavered just above the desk. Mourinho said: 'The difference between me and Souness is this - Souness as a player, up there. Jose Mourinho as a player, down here. Jose Mourinho as a manager, up here. Souness as a manager, down there. 'With another difference: I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man.'

Diego Costa trains at Cobham ahead of Chelsea's Premier League clash with Southampton on Sunday . But writing in the Sunday Times, Souness was sticking to his guns. 'He had his say about me at his press conference on Friday and he is entitled to his opinion, but it won't change mine,' he said. 'When he reflects on what went wrong against PSG and addresses it , I hope - yet doubt - that will include the obsession with gamesmanship. 'It seemed more important to Chelsea than getting on the ball and taking on PSG in a game of football, which they were more than capable of winning. They are a far better team than they showed.

Steve Ashton, 50, was awarded just £3,125 after a two-year legal battle. Mr Ashton, who was repeatedly abused by the late DJ from the age of ten, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I would have got more for whiplash. 'It makes you wonder how many more of Savile’s victims have been fobbed off with such a derisory amount.’ Victim: Steve Ashton (left) who was abused by Jimmy Savile when he was 10,  was awarded £3,125 after a two-year legal battle . Mr Ashton said his case was not about the money, but he felt the figure was a snub to all victims. ‘What is this going to show to other people in this situation?’ he asked. ‘Do they want to go through years of absolute hell for such an amount? Hundreds of people who have yet to come forward will think, “I’m not having my life made into an open book for such a small amount.” It’s a disgrace. ‘No money can make up for Savile’s effect on my life. But there should be some recognition from the authorities of the damage done.’ Mr Ashton added that his payout, which had been contested by the NHS Charitable Trust, ‘is probably one day’s work for the law firm that represented me’. He added: ‘You hear of celebrities receiving £50,000 after having their phones hacked, but how does that compare with being sexually molested as a ten-year-old boy again and again? ‘I’ve been going through this for 40 years and I still feel Savile laughing at me.’ Mr Ashton’s award was calculated using a compensation ‘tariff’, which sets payouts at between £1,500 for indecent assault over clothing to £40,000 for rape. Victims are entitled to more if they can prove lasting psychiatric damage or repeated abuse. The compensation scheme, set up jointly by Savile’s estate, the BBC, the NHS, children’s charity Barnardos and lawyers acting for the victims, was finally approved by the Court of Appeal three months ago. Payments capped at £60,000 have been awarded to more than 200 people who applied. Each claim triggers payments of up to £16,000 to lawyers. ‘My law firm was very caring, but they will come out of this far wealthier and happier than I did,’ Mr Ashton said. He added that he was advised he might be able to secure more by continuing his fight in the High Court, but decided not to as success was not guaranteed. Savile befriended Mr Ashton at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, where the victim’s mother Pamela worked as a spinal injuries researcher. The abuse happened in the Porter’s Lodge and in Savile’s private room at the hospital. Mr Ashton recalled: ‘He used to say, “This is our secret.” ‘If everywhere was busy he would take me to the mortuary. He once pointed at the fridges and said, “If you’re a naughty boy for Jimmy, this is where you’ll end up”.’","Repeatedly abused victim said he would have 'got more for whiplash'

- Steve Ashton, 50, was repeatedly sexually abused by Jimmy Savile from age 10 and was awarded just £3,125 compensation after a two-year legal battle with the NHS.

- Ashton feels the amount is ""derisory and insulting"", stating he would have received more for whiplash, and worries it will discourage other victims from coming forward. 

- The compensation was calculated using a tariff system, with payouts ranging from £1,500 for indecent assault to £40,000 for rape, plus more for proven psychiatric damage or repeated abuse.

- Over 200 victims have received payouts capped at £60,000 from a scheme involving Savile's estate, the BBC, NHS, and victim lawyers, who can get up to £16,000 per claim.

- Ashton says no money can make up for Savile's impact but there should be recognition of the damage done. He considered continuing his court fight but decided against it.

- Savile befriended Ashton at Stoke Mandeville Hospital where Ashton's mother worked, and abused him in areas like the porter's lodge, threatening him with the mortuary.",0.78,"Analyze the given text thoroughly to extract essential information.

Prioritize factual correctness over strict length constraints.",5,"Frustrated Red Bull team boss Christian Horner was left to reflect on 'a s****y Sunday' and the fear fans will turn off Formula One after Mercedes' domination of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. After winning the constructors' and drivers' titles for four years from 2010-2013, with Sebastian Vettel at the helm, Mercedes have taken up the mantle of F1 powerhouse. After winning 16 of 19 grands prix in 2014 to claim the constructors' crown, and with Lewis Hamilton clinching his second championship, the start to 2015 was a breeze for Mercedes. Lewis Hamilton (right) and Nico Rosberg finished first and second respectively at the Australian Grand Prix . Hamilton races to victory in Melbourne as Mercedes dominance of Formula One rolls on . The two Mercedes team-mates celebrate their winning start to the new season with some champagne . Re-live every lap of the Melbourne race . Hamilton beat team-mate Nico Rosberg by 1.3secs, with Vettel third on his debut for Ferrari, but 34.5secs off the pace. Predicting 'a two-horse race at every grand prix this year', Horner has called on the FIA to act to prevent an F1 yawn, and he is fully aware of how his comments will be viewed given Red Bull's past success. 'When we were winning - and we were never winning to the advantage they have - I remember double diffusers were banned, exhausts were moved, flexible bodywork was prohibited, engine mapping mid-season was changed,' said Horner of the steps taken to negate his team's performance. 'Anything was done, and that wasn't just unique to Red Bull, but Williams in previous years and McLaren etcetera. 'Is it healthy to have this situation? The FIA, within the rules, have an equalisation mechanism and it is perhaps something we need to look at. Red Bull chief Christian Horner is concerned that Mercedes dominance will be unhealthy for the sport . Horner's Red Bull team won consecutive titles between 2010-2013 with Sebastian Vettel behind the wheel . Red Bull driver Daniil Kvyat was forced to retire early in what was called a 's****y weekend' by Horner . 'Mercedes, take nothing away from them, they have done a great job and they have a good car, a fantastic engine, and two very good drivers. 'The problem is the gap is so big you end up with three-tier racing and that's not healthy for Formula One. 'The FIA have the facts and they could quite easily come up with some form of equalisation otherwise I fear the interest will wane. 'I didn't see Mercedes much on the TV, and I can only imagine that's because it's not interesting watching a procession and the producer was looking to pick out other battles in the race.' Referring to the fact Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger conducted the podium ceremony, Horner added: 'The highlight for me was seeing Arnie on the podium!' Horner's comments were borne out of exasperation at the job power-unit supplier Renault have done since the system came into force at the start of last season. The hope was Renault would have closed the gap to Mercedes over the winter, but instead they appear to have fallen further steps back. Hollywood actor Arnold Schwarzenegger interviewed winner Hamilton after the race in Australia . The former governor of California raises a smile from third placed Sebastian Vettel now of Ferrari . An angry Horner, who saw Daniil Kvyat retire on the formation lap with a gearbox issue, said: 'It's been a tough weekend and a very tough weekend for Renault. 'The engine is quite undriveable and you can see and hear that from the comments the drivers are making. 'They need to have a clear vision and they need it quickly because it's frustrating we are effectively further back than we were in Abu Dhabi in both power and driveability. 'It's disappointing and been a s***y Sunday for us. We can only get better and get our heads down and work harder at it.' 1. Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes 1:31:54.067 . 2.

Dyke is facing opposition to his plans from the Premier League but UEFA president Platini said the European body would work to help him. It comes as Dyke said it was 'depressing' to read Rio Ferdinand's newspaper column claiming that managers such as Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho may not be giving young English players a chance. UEFA president Michel Platini agrees with Gerg Dyke's plans to increase number of homegrown players . The FA chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 . While there is a slight increase in the number of English players in the Premier League this year — up from 32% last year to 35% — that is largely down to Burnley being promoted. If they were to be relegated and replaced by Watford — second in the Championship — the proportion would fall to 31%. However, only 22% of the starters in the current top four teams are qualified to play for England, compared to 28% last year. In 2014, just 23 English players appeared in the Champions League group stage, compared with 78 Spaniards, 55 Germans and 51 Brazilians. This season the three English clubs that reached the knockout stages of the Champions League started only 10 English players, compared to 12 French and nine Spanish in those three sides. In the last two weeks only five English players started in the second legs of the knockout stage. In 2010 England Under 17s won the European Championship, beating Spain in the final. Of that 18-man match-day squad, only four have gone on to play more than 20 top-flight games, while double that from the Spanish squad have done so in La Liga. Of the 12 clubs who have played in each of the last five Premier League seasons, the average number of home-grown players per squad has gone from 11.4 to 9.4. Only 62% of current home-grown players are qualified to play for England. Platini, speaking after the UEFA Congress in Vienna, said: 'This is a position we defend. We're not only talking about England, we're talking all of Europe. Mr Dyke's struggle with the FA is something we share and we agree with him. 'With the new leader of the European Commission it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect home-grown, grass-roots young players in the different countries. We share the same perspective. We will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one. 'There is free flow of workers but there are some things that doesn't work well and we need to address it.' UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino admitted that its similar rule of eight home-grown players in European squads was not working as well as it should and called Dyke's initiative 'fantastic'. He added: 'We are at eight out of 25 and we see it is not really as great as it should be so whatever move in favour of increasing home-grown players is something we can only support. Congratulations to England.' Dyke's proposals are set to be discussed at a Premier League chairmen's meeting on Thursday as well as the FA board. They also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than 21. The FA chairman said: 'I thought Rio Ferdinand's column was in some ways quite depressing. It virtually said Mourinho is virtually saying he is not going to play the kids anyway. Why have an academy then? 'It's not fair on the kids. It was always tough for kids to get through but it seems unfair now.' Asked if he had looked at how the FA could force the new rules through despite opposition, he replied: 'We have but that's not the way we want to go. We have looked at it yes.' Former England defender Rio Ferdinand claimed that youngsters were not being given a chance at Chelsea . Chelsea' s Ruben Loftus-Cheek is highly rated but has found chances limited under Jose Mourinho . Dyke said all the proposals were open for discussion. He added: 'I think it's more about the clubs than the leadership if you want my honest opinion. It's the unfairness of a system that is massively improved because of the EPPP (Elite Player Performance Plan) which was introduced by the Premier League led by Richard Scudamore, he has done a great job. 'The trouble is that it is only any good if the kids get through the system - if they can't get through the system why bother? 'We are open to discussions on all of it. This is a set of ideas which we think will work.'","FA chairman proposed raising the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 at Premier League clubs .
Greg Dyke's plans also include 'home-grown' players having to train in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than 21 .

- Very few English players are getting chances in the Champions League, with only 10 starters from English clubs in the knockout rounds compared to 12 French and 9 Spanish.
- England's youth teams have had success but few of those players go on to get first-team opportunities at top clubs.
- The number of home-grown players in squads of long-term Premier League clubs has actually declined from 11.4 to 9.4 on average over the last 5 seasons.  
- UEFA acknowledges its own home-grown player rules are not working well enough and supports Dyke's ""fantastic"" initiative.

The hoses outside the front  of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission. News of their existence emerged via CBS News this week, triggering outcry from the wider community. Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night - 'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources'. Against building regulations: The main cathedral in San Francisco has been ordered to take down a sprinkler system used to deter homeless from sleeping in its porchways . Discreet: The hoses outside the front of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently installed two years ago without necessary planning permission . Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless, added that the time-triggered mechanisms were 'certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings.' However, the church defended the sprinkler idea stating that it wasn't safe having homeless people and drug addicts lurking when families were visiting. Chris Lyford, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, told CBS that staff tried to find other forms of accommodation for those without shelter. 'We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,' Lyford said. 'To Saint Anthony's soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes.' Wrong move: Some branded the sprayers - which used hundreds of gallons of water every night - 'shocking', 'rude', 'inhumane' and a 'waste of resources' Roughing it: A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas . Lyford claimed he did not know about the sprinkler system until it was brought to his attention but another church staff member said the spouts were installed over a year ago. According to CBS, the rain showers ran for 75 seconds every 30 to 60 minutes. A homeless man named Michael revealed that some people were not deterred by the water and merely ventured out with umbrellas. 'You've got some pretty hardcore homeless people who actually don’t care... so they’ll go in there and sleep.' Robert, another homeless San Francisco inhabitant, said that as well as the water systems there were signs pasted up stating 'No Trespassing.' Time-triggered mechanism: According to CBS, the rain showers ran for 75 seconds every 30 to 60 minutes. However, now the sprinklers will be taken down as they reportedly violate the San Francisco Department of Building Inspection code. The church has 15 days to comply and remove the system. Bishop William Justice, the rector of Saint Mary's Cathedral, issued a statement apologizing for any upset the church's homeless deterrent had caused. He said the sprinklers were modeled on similar systems used in the city’s Financial District 'as a safety, security and cleanliness measure to avoid the situation where needles, feces and other dangerous items were regularly being left in these hidden doorways. 'The problem was particularly dangerous because students and elderly people regularly pass these locations on their way to school and mass every day,' he added. Justice said since the archdiocese has learned the system may violate the city’s water-use laws, work to remove it would be 'completed by the end of the day'.","The hoses outside the front of Saint Mary of the Assumption were apparently  in violation of building regulations .

Kalou, who is now at Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin, was filmed chiseling the Wall by German terrestrial broadcaster ARD in a preview video for Hertha's game against Schalke on Saturday. The clip, which was filmed in the autumn, was shown in the Olympic Stadium before the game, and repeated on ARD's Saturday night highlights show Sportschau. Former Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou was filmed taking a piece out of the Berlin Wall . TV presenter Gerhard Delling was left stunned after seeing Kalou take a chunk out of the Berlin Wall . The Ivory Coast international could be hit with a £7,100 fine after smashing lump out of Wall . The producers had come up with the idea of the hammer and chisel as a metaphor for Kalou's task of smashing his way into Schalke's rigid defence, with the Berlin Wall representing Schalke coach Roberto Di Matteo's unpopular defensive style. The former Chelsea man obliged unquestioningly, and set about attacking a section of the East Side Gallery, an open air graffiti exhibition which is one of the longest remaining sections of the Wall. The Ivorian was apparently unaware that the Gallery, which attracts more than a million tourists a year, is protected under German monument protection law. Not only that, but the gallery is beloved of many Berliners, with hundreds joining David Hasselhoff and Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to protest against its partial dismantlement last year. Kani Alavi, head of the artist's initiative in charge of East Side Gallery, was particularly incensed by Kalou's actions. 'When I initially saw the pictures, I nearly fell off the sofa,' Alavi said. 'Some celebrity is promoting himself at the cost of a monument, and public broadcasters are playing along. It shows a lack of respect. I'm very disappointed.' ARD producers came up with idea ahead of Hertha Berlin's match against Schalke in reference to Roberto Di Matteo's defensive approach . Hertha Berlin striker Kalou played the full 90 minutes of his side's 2-2 draw with Schalke . The initiative has now made an official complaint to the police, and is looking to sue Kalou for around €10,000 (£7,100) worth of damage. The actual extent of the damage, and whether or not Kalou or the broadcaster will be held responsible, remains unclear. 'It's not the first time it's happened,' Alavi told BZ. 'We had a case a few years ago where someone was caught daubing the wall without permission, and they were ordered to pay €2,500 (£1,800) by the court. Alavi was not the only one shocked by the clip. When it was broadcast on Sportschau, presenter Gerhard Delling was visibly taken aback, saying 'he's really taken a piece out of the Wall, there. The beautiful, old Berlin Wall!'. Delling's comment led to even more uproar, and the presenter was forced to defend himself against accusations of nostalgia for the oppressive Wall.","Salomon Kalou was filmed chiseling the Berlin Wall by TV station ARD .

A food shop owner who was back using a food mincer less than an hour after it had sliced off the fingers of a part-time employee has been ordered to pay out more than £25,000. Akthar Khan - who used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean the machine - was also handed an eight month suspended sentence after earlier admitting a single breach of health and safety regulations. Judge James Burbidge QC described Khan's management as 'woeful', and said: 'It is beyond belief the machine was still being used even after a man lost his fingers.' Birmingham Magistrates Court had previously heard Aston's Ash Food Fare's meat slicer had lost its safety guard a month before Mr Iqbal lost his fingers in October 2012. Staff had been using a plunger to insert meat since the breakage, the city's magistrates' court heard. Fellow workers heard Mr Iqbal screaming  as he placed his right hand inside the machine, which continued to operate as an ambulance crew rushed to the shop. A paramedic only recovered three of Mr Iqbal's fingers after the machine was dismantled. But an hour later a police officer arrived to find the machine was back in use and one of the employees said washing liquid had been used to clean it. Khan, 57, then admitted he had used Fairy Liquid. Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Abdul (the manager) said he used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean it, which was fairly inadequate. 'He then passed vegetables through it before using it. There was no safe system of work here at all. 'We have looked and we can't find any steps he (Khan) took to protect his staff from the unguarded mincer.' Simon Morgan, defending, maintained Khan, of Witton, Birmingham, knew nothing of the missing hand guard - but said he fully accepted responsibility and 'bitterly regrets the injury caused'. 'He is 57 years of age, has no previous convictions, he is very highly regarded,' Mr Morgan said. 'He has worked extremely hard all his life.' Mr Morgan said Khan had also carried out good work for the benefit of the community spanning two decades. Suspended: Khan, 57, was a 'woeful' manager, according to Judge James Burbidge QC . Judge Burbidge said: 'You should have been more proactive and should be well attuned, given your position in the community, to follow basic safety procedures. 'If you had been, Mr Iqbal would not have suffered that traumatic amputation.'

And now a sketch for the project has revealed the habitat the first astronauts on Mars could reside in - if they ever get there. It includes living quarters, a laboratory, a greenhouse and even a holodeck to give the crew the best conditions possible on the red planet. Hover cursor over the image below to zoom in . Danish space architect Kristian von Bengtson revealed his sketch for Mars One's habitat on the red planet (shown). The concept includes living quarters, a laboratory and even a holodeck. There are two habitats in total, one for 'living' (left) and one for 'work' (right). Credit: Kristian von Bengtson/MarsOne . The concept, drawn up by Mars One's Capsule and Outpost Manager, Kristian von Bengtson from Denmark, consists of two long cylindrical inflatable habitats - with a total area of 2,150 square feet (200 square metres). In February 100 people - including five Britons - were shortlisted for the questionable Mars One mission, which claims it will send people to live on the red planet. They are hoping to be chosen to be among the final crew of four who are set to begin their new lives in just 10 years time - and ultimately die on Mars. The team is scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a gruelling seven-month journey from Earth. 'The large cut in candidates [from 200,000 to 100] is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to Mars,' said Bas Lansdorp, co-founder of the Dutch Mars One mission. 'These aspiring Martians provide the world with a glimpse into who the modern day explorers will be.' The Mars 100 Round Three candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews. They include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round. At the front, each has a module to which a lander can attach and the crew can enter. One of the habitats is designed more for living, while the other seems to be geared more towards work. In the residential habitat, there is a kitchen for food preparation with a total area of 320 square feet (30 square metres). Moving further into the habitat and you come to a social area of a similar area, which has a ‘holodeck’ to keep the crew entertained. This appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat, to simulate being in another environment. Further along, are the private crew quarters, measuring about 65 square feet (six square metres). And finally, the crop section, which grows the food the astronauts will need to survive, is found at the end. It has a watering system and humidity controls to keep everything in working order. In the ‘work’ habitat, there is a laboratory and science section for various experiments - including an insects cabinet and biology laboratory. There’s also a storage area to keep cargo, while the section is also curtailed by a crop system as well. Mars One made headlines around the world in February when it revealed the final longlist of 100 applicants who will train on Earth for a one-way mission to the red planet in 2025. But the proposed mission has been widely criticised ever since it was first announced in 2011 - and experts have said this latest announcement does nothing to silence the sceptics. Lack of funding, no signs of development and an overly ambitious ‘reality TV’ approach have all been cited as reasons that Mars One will never be more than a pipe dream. ‘You have to applaud the ambition, but sadly the whole project feels very much like wing-and-a-prayer stuff when you start to look into the details,’ Giles Sparrow, author of Mars: A New View of the Red Planet, told MailOnline. ‘They say they can put a first crew on Mars for $6 billion [£3.9 billion], which is a shoestring budget compared to the Apollo programme which cost $25 billion [£16.2 billion] - and that was in 1960s money!’ It could be you: Pictured are some of the Mars One hopefuls, who will be spending eight years in training ahead of what they think will be a mission to Mars, although the mission has been widely criticised for the lack of a feasible plan to actually get to the red planet . In the sketch the habitat has a social area with a ‘holodeck’ to keep the crew entertained. This appears to consist of screens on the walls of the habitat, to simulate being in another environment - so it'll likely be a bit more primitive than the holodeck used in Star Trek (shown) Dr Lewis Dartnell from the Space Research Centre at the University of Leicester added: ‘‘There are a large number of technological considerations for safely sending a human mission to Mars. ‘These include the long-term reliability of life-support systems and how to grow sufficient food and for a balanced diet, and these necessary technologies are not yet mature enough or well-tested in less risky situations -such as on a moon base. ‘But even the first step of securing enough large rockets to launch the mission to Mars has not been demonstrated by Mars One.’ However CEO and co-founder of Mars One responded to the criticism, telling MailOnline he believed they ‘have a good plan and we can overcome the challenges.’ Later in February, though, the production company Endemol announced they would no longer be making an accompanying TV show for the venture. This would have documented the training and lives of the astronauts on the red planet. Mars One said they were now working with a new production company to record the colonists’ progress. The latest sketch seems to be a bit different to previous concepts shown by Mars One. This one shows habitats and a rover on the surface. Who will build these habitats is not quite clear, although they appear to bear some similarity to SpaceX's proposed Red Dragon capsule .","Danish space architect Kristian von Bengtson revealed his sketch for Mars One's habitat on the red planet .

That's what a team of international researchers is hoping after finding a genetic marker linked to PTSD in the blood samples of Marines stationed in conflict zones. ""We'll draw the blood and have a way to do this very rapidly and start to tease apart who is a little more at risk and who is a little more resilient for PTSD,"" says principal investigator Dr. Dewleen Baker of the University of California-San Diego. ""It's exciting."" PTSD can occur after many types of trauma: rape, torture, child abuse, natural disasters and car, plane, and train wrecks, to name a few. According to the PTSD Alliance, more than 13 million Americans have PTSD and the societal cost is in the billions. Women are about twice as likely as men to develop the disorder. Symptoms tend to cluster into three areas: . •Reliving the event via nightmares or vivid images, along with an extreme reaction such as uncontrollable shaking, chills or heart palpitations. •Avoiding reminders of the event, including becoming emotionally withdrawn and detached from friends, family and everyday activities. •Being hyperaroused, easily startled, irritable, angry, or having difficulty sleeping or concentrating. As one might expect, service members are hardest hit. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates 30% of all Vietnam vets have experienced PTSD. Among troops recently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, PTSD can run as high as 20% in any given year. But why does severe emotional trauma trigger PTSD in some people and not others? The idea that your genes play a role in whether you develop PTSD is a popular focus of recent research. Scientists have discovered genes that help regulate fear reactions in mice. The lack of a fear-regulating brain chemical called gastrin-releasing peptide led to greater fear response among the rodents. In another study, mice without a protein necessary to form ""fear memories"" were less likely to freeze up and more willing to explore unknown spaces. Studies of twins show heredity accounts for about 30% of the differences in response to trauma, with identical twins much more likely to both develop PTSD than fraternal twins. Other research has looked into the role of inherited brain differences, mental disorders, or addictive tendencies. An unusual avenue of research is how our immune systems may contribute to the development of PTSD symptoms. Prior studies of people diagnosed with PTSD compared to control groups without the disorder suggest differences in genes related to inflammation may play a role. ""The body is built to keep us alive and it functions as one big system,"" says Baker, discussing the interface between stress and immune chemicals. ""The systems all talk to each other."" The recent study, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, is unique because it compares blood samples from 188 Marines taken before and after they were deployed to combat zones. Another group of 96 Marines was also studied to verify the results. ""Under this experimental design, not only can we identify differences between U.S. Marines with PTSD and without, but we can go back in time, so to speak, to see if any of the Marines who eventually developed PTSD"" showed evidence that it would emerge, says the study's co-senior author, Christopher Woelk. ""In this vein, we are able to start labeling findings as being putatively 'causal' in nature."" In the blood of Marines ultimately diagnosed with PTSD, the study found biomarkers associated with gene networks that regulate innate immune function -- the body's first line of defense -- and interferon, a protein responsible for kicking the immune system into action. In addition, this hypervigilant immune response occurred before and after exposure to trauma. ""Why do certain people start out with slightly higher immune response and others have less? Is it somehow just built in or have they been exposed to some kind of pathogen?"" asks Baker. Instead of pathogens, another possible explanation is that the inflammatory response is activated by the stress of going off to war. ""You could try to dampen down the activation and see if that improves symptoms or prevents development of PTSD,"" says Baker. Baker stresses these questions are purely hypothetical at this time and that the study needs to be replicated and expanded. ""We're early in the process of having some clues as to what might predict risk and resilience, and with more research we'll begin to have effective preventions and treatments,"" says Baker.","More than 13 million Americans have PTSD .
Genes account for about 30% of risk .
Immune system plays a role in risk and resilience .","Here are the key points summarized from the article in a concise, multi-sentence format:

The study found a potential genetic marker linked to PTSD risk by analyzing blood samples from Marines before and after deployment to combat zones. Those who ultimately developed PTSD showed biomarkers associated with gene networks regulating the innate immune system's inflammatory response - both before and after trauma exposure. This suggests a hereditary predisposition toward an overactive immune response may contribute to PTSD vulnerability. However, the findings are preliminary and need further replication and research. If confirmed, a simple blood test could potentially identify those genetically more prone to PTSD, allowing preventive measures or treatments to be explored. The study provides new clues about how the body's stress response and immune function may interact with genetic factors in the development of PTSD.",0.8523809523809524,"Thoroughly analyze the given text to identify and extract the essential information, key events, important facts, and logical implications.

A heroin addict is facing a long jail sentence after he admitted killing an 11-year-old girl in a hit and run crash while on bail. Christopher Hannah was high on drugs when he ploughed into Sophie Brannan, her friend and her friend’s uncle as they walked home from local shops on November 14 last year. Hannah, 33, lost control of his hired Vauxhall Astra, mounted the pavement and hit the three victims so hard from behind they were thrown over the car. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury. Hannah, the son of a bankrupt businessman, fled the scene in Sandbank Street in Glasgow’s Maryhill – but later called a friend to say he had been ‘driving like a madman’ and had hit someone. At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, the father of three pleaded guilty to culpable homicide and was remanded in custody for sentence next month. The court heard Hannah’s car, which he had hired a month earlier, mounted the pavement and hit the gable end of a nearby building before careering into Sophie and her companions. Prosecutor Allan Nicol said: ‘This caused them to be thrown onto the bonnet, windscreen and roof of the vehicle before falling onto the ground. Another motorist witnessed the carnage and immediately turned back to help poor Sophie.’ Witnesses saw Hannah speed into Maryhill Road, with his badly dented car being ‘driven erratically’ before he crashed into a taxi. The cab driver tailed Hannah, who eventually stopped a short distance away. Mr Nicol said: ‘At that point, the accused was trying to pull the damaged front bumper, then he stopped and walked away before starting to run off. ‘Both the taxi driver and his passengers noticed he was under the influence of some substance.’ Paramedics took Sophie to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones. Tributes left at the scene after the crash last year. Hannah fled scene but pleaded guilty at High Court in Glasgow yesterday . She remained in intensive care overnight, but died the following day. The court heard Sophie’s friend suffered a serious leg break which will require long-term physiotherapy. Mr Nicol said: ‘She also suffers episodes of withdrawal and angry outbursts. She is due to attend for psychiatric assessment in order to come to terms with her injuries and the loss of Sophie.’ The girl’s uncle also suffered a number of fractures, but was initially released from hospital two days later. However, he eventually required surgery and is likely to have ‘long-term restriction’ in movement to his right shoulder. The court heard Hannah stayed on the run for two days after Sophie’s death, despite promising his partner he would hand himself in. When police finally arrested him, they found heroin hidden inside his boxer shorts. Sophie suffered catastrophic head injuries and died the following day in hospital. Her ten-year-old friend had a badly broken leg and the 36-year-old uncle suffered a serious shoulder injury . Accident investigators later concluded Hannah was solely to blame for the crash. They said he took ‘a conscious decision’ to drive while impaired and failed to stop because he knew he had taken drugs and was ‘aware of the ramifications’. Hannah also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin. He has 14 previous convictions for crimes including possessing an offensive weapon and road traffic charges and was on bail at the time, having been freed from Glasgow’s Justice of the Peace Court two months before the crash. Hannah’s advocate Thomas Ross said: ‘He has asked to state publicly his apologies for those affected by this terrible tragedy.’","Christopher Hannah, 33, was high on drugs when he hit Sophie Brannan .

The former Major League Baseball pitcher recently fired off a series of fastballs and mowed down a group of Twitter trolls who made the mistake of tweeting vulgar and sexually-explicit comments about Schilling's teenage daughter. The drama started, innocently enough, on February 25, when Schilling played the role of a proud father. He sent a tweet congratulating his daughter, Gabby, on being accepted to Salve Regina University, where she'll play softball. It read: ""Congrats to Gabby Schilling who will pitch for the Salve Regina Seahawks next year!! — Curt Schilling (@gehrig38)"" Almost immediately, responses came in from young men, complete strangers who apparently followed Schilling on Twitter. The tweets quickly went from immature, to creepy, to repugnant. Threats of rape were common. The tweets were deleted, and the accounts were closed after this story went viral. But not before Schilling captured some of the images and posted them on his blog. What was said about 17-year-old Gabby Schilling wasn't just obnoxious. It was vile and obscene. What was said wasn't just mean and ugly. It was threatening and scary. As a parent, it's the kind of thing that makes you rethink your opposition to public caning as a logical punishment for such transgressions. These misogynistic cowards may have thought they could hide in the darkness of anonymity, the sort that many have come to expect from social media sites, where you feel free to be a  despicable human being because, you think, no one will ever find out who you really are and hold you accountable for your words. If so, they thought wrong. They couldn't hide. They were found out, and they got the throttling they so richly deserved. Thanks to dad. According to Schilling, who made it his mission to track down these cretins and make sure those they associate with know who they really are, two people have already paid a price due to their tweets. One was a student disc jockey at a community college in New Jersey, who was suspended, and the other was a part-time ticket seller for the New York Yankees, who was fired. Concerned that this is an example of exactly the kind of cyberbullying that leads some teenagers to commit suicide, Schilling is also thinking about taking legal action against some of the other people involved. Bravo for him. I'm sure that, all across America, dads with daughters -- after reading some of the horrible things that were said about this young girl -- are marveling at Schilling's self-control. I have two daughters of my own, and he's a better man than me. If ever there was a case where profanity-spewing malcontents deserved to have their mouths washed out with soap, this is it. So what additional insights can we draw, and what larger lessons can we learn, from this unexpected but predictable collision of old-fashioned parenthood and newfangled media? There are a few. The first is about accountability, the very thing that the young men who posted these hurtful messages were trying to avoid. But Schilling wouldn't let them. At their best, social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and others allow the sharing the information and the building of a sense of community. At their worst, they become digital sandboxes and locker rooms where people think have a license to misbehave without having to worry about consequences. We need to applaud efforts like this that promote greater online accountability. There's also something to be said about protective parents, and how essential they are to a working society. We should still be concerned about those overprotective parents who hover like helicopters from little league to job interviews. We shouldn't bubblewrap our kids, and keep them from playing outdoors, and then sit around wondering why they're soft, timid, and risk-averse. But protective parents -- the kind who shield their kids from real danger -- never go out of style. A parent's top job is to protect his children. Schilling did his job. Finally, it's worth reminding everyone that freedom of expression does not mean freedom from rules, standards, and expectations that should guide your behavior. There are things you don't say. There are boundaries, ways that we expect you to behave so you don't terrorize other people or bring shame upon yourself, your friends, and your family. If you don't have social skills, you don't belong on social media. The tweets make you wince. But in this story, you'll still find plenty to smile about. This whole drama unfolded because Schilling was proud of his daughter. Now, given how he reacted, we all have reason to be proud of him. ​ .","Ruben Navarrette: Schilling deserves praise for taking on online haters for offensive comments about his daughter .

In what was meant to be an incredibly proud day for the family, quickly went sour on February 25 with vile responses to the baseball legend's original tweet. Schilling wrote on his blog post: 'And tweets with the word rape, bloody underwear and pretty much every other vulgar and defiling word you could likely fathom began to follow.' Mr Schilling told GMA on Tuesday: 'Anybody that reads those tweets and says it's just a joke, they are not fathers of kids.'

'The student has been summarily suspended and will be scheduled for a conduct hearing where further disciplinary action will be taken. The Brookdale Police are actively investigating this matter.'

'I know every one of their names, their parents, where they go to school, what they do, what team they are on, their positions, stats, all of it.' He said that the guys behind the bullying are not thugs or 'kids who had it rough', but they are 'pretty much' all white, affluent, college-attending children. Following the incident, he said a few of the other trolls wrote to him apologizing after they were suspended from their college sports' teams, and two others have since deleted their Twitter accounts. One Twitter user, Mike Kelly from Utah, wrote to Schilling asking if he felt good to have gotten kids 'kicked off' their sports teams. Schilling responded: 'Not sure I can tell you how good. Being able to defend my daughter. Someday when you understand honor, integrity, you'll get it.' In his protective-father mode, he also wrote as a reminder to those who went after his daughter that 'the real world has consequences' and that 'we're at a point now where you better be sure who you're going after'. At the end of his post he said that he apologized to Gabby, who he said might be embarrassed by it all, but  like any dad, he just wants her to head to college knowing how much he loves her.

Official figures out yesterday also show a decline in families living wholly off state handouts. Along with a report last week showing record numbers in work, the figures provide fresh evidence that Iain Duncan Smith's reforms are nudging more welfare claimants into jobs. The Work and Pensions Secretary's apparent success was obscured however by the fall-out of David Cameron's decision to quit by 2020 – and the continuing focus on politicians' kitchens. Official figures show 15.9 households have no-one in work, down from almost 19 per cent in 2010 . Mr Duncan Smith's introduction of universal credit and a £500 a week benefit cap have been heavily criticised by the Left and the poverty lobby which claim families have been impoverished. But yesterday's figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate the reforms are helping to switch large numbers of people from a life on welfare handouts to jobs and earnings. The count showed that the number of jobless households with at least one working age adult fell from 3,763,000 in the last three months of 2010 to 3,149,000 at the end of last year. The 16 per cent drop was a result of unemployed people finding jobs and the economically inactive – those previously uninterested in working – moving into the labour market. The number of homes where no one has ever worked, the hard core of benefit-dependent individuals and families, fell from 275,000 in the final months of 2010 to 245,000 in the same period last year. There were 372,000 fewer children in jobless homes than in 2010, and the number of children in families where no one has ever worked, over 302,000 at the end of 2011, was down to 221,000 at the end of last year. Mr Duncan Smith said: 'The primary aim of our welfare reforms has been to support everyone who is able to work into jobs, to give people the skills as well as the opportunities to be part of the economic recovery. And we've seen remarkable success – with an average of 1,000 more people in work for every single day that this Government has been in power. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures showed that almost 2million people are now enjoying the 'self-esteem and financial security that a job brings' 'In total, 1.9million more people with the self-esteem and financial security that a job brings. 'These figures reveal that the number of workless households has fallen by over 600,000 under this Government. Most significantly, there are 272,000 fewer households living in social housing without work. 'And the proportion in social housing where someone does now work with a breadwinner and a role model, is the highest since records began.' Mr Duncan Smith added: 'Behind these figures are countless stories of hard work and determination. By sticking to our long-term economic plan our welfare reforms are transforming the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities.' The worklessness count came on top of last week's record employment figures and a zero inflation rate likely to be good news for families at a time when incomes are beginning to rise again in the wake of the recession. A think tank founded by Mr Duncan Smith, the Centre for Social Justice, called yesterday for changes to the way child poverty is measured. It said that narrow financial measures of poverty are meaningless and have no bearing on the realities of children's lives. The poverty line, usually put at 60 per cent of average income, is 'unrealistic, narrow and naïve', it said. Christian Guy, the centre's director, said: 'Despite some outstanding recent progress on job creation and social justice measures, the official child poverty targets don't help the Government to change the lives of the poorest children. 'Poverty is about more than money. For too many families it is about addiction, worklessness, family breakdown, failing schools and debt traps.' Last Wednesday, figures revealed that 73.3 per cent of working-age people are employed – the highest rate since records began in 1971. The jobless total is 1.86million, the lowest level since the summer of 2008. The unemployment rate is 5.7 per cent compared with a European Union average of 9.8 per cent.","Official figures reveal decline in families living wholly off state handouts .

""I was very surprised to learn of the double standard,"" former Ambassador to Kenya and Air Force General Scott Gration told CNN. Gration noted that Cheryl Mills, the then-State Department Chief of Staff ""obviously knew Secretary Clinton was using commercial email, yet she stated my use of Gmail was one of the reasons I had to move on."" The retired Air Force Major General, who flew 274 combat missions over Iraq as a fighter pilot and served as President Obama's Special Envoy to Sudan, recalled he had been ""prohibited from sending a Gmail message to a State Department computer except in an emergency."" Considering that ""Department of Defense dot mil accounts, USAID accounts, and every Kenyan account used the same routers and security firewalls as a Gmail account,"" he took issue with State Department protocols. ""It didn't make sense to me that the State Department would ban my 'Gmail.com' while letting all other commercial and foreign accounts through its computer firewall,"" he told CNN. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton declined comment. Spokespeople at the State Department repeatedly declined to address whether any sort of double standard had been applied and instead continually noted that in the State Department Inspector General report  about the U.S. embassy being run by Gration there were ""several concerns with management and leadership"" discussed, not just about his use of private email. The Inspector General report charged that Gration ""lost the respect and confidence of the staff to lead the mission"" and ""damaged the cohesion of Embassy Nairobi's country team."" Gration said he makes ""no apology for 'rocking the boat' in the State Department to improve physical security, to enhance cyber policy, and to conduct several other initiatives that the State Department Inspector General misrepresented to build the case that Secretary Clinton's Chief of Staff used to terminate my tenure as the U.S. ambassador in 2012."" The State Department's continued referencing of the other allegations against Gration came amidst fruitless attempts by CNN to ask the department spokespeople to explain why it was acceptable for Secretary Clinton to use private email to conduct official business given that the 2012 Inspector General's report against Gration repeatedly hammered him for the use of ""commercial email for official government business"" which was considered to be ""flouting of direct instructions to adhere to Department policy."" As CNN reported Thursday, the report stated clearly that It ""is the Department's general policy that normal day-to-day operations be conducted on an authorized information system, which has the proper level of security controls,"" the report stated. ""The use of unauthorized information systems increases the risk for data loss, phishing, and spoofing of email accounts, as well as inadequate protections for personally identifiable information. The use of unauthorized information systems can also result in the loss of official public records as these systems do not have approved record preservation or backup functions. Conducting official business on non- Department automated information systems must be limited to only maintaining communications during emergencies."" Asked if he was subsequently surprised to see this controversy erupt about his then-boss doing essentially the same thing, Gration told CNN ""I'm not surprised when any political issue becomes a controversy.  I learned long ago to do your best, do what was right, and to have a thick skin.  I still wake up each day without regrets because I still have my integrity.  That said, illegal, immoral, or unethical activities should be investigated properly, not just for political gain, but because we demand this of our public leaders. That's the only way we can preserve trust in our system of governance.  Punish crimes and forgive mistakes."" Gration said that his ""experience was somewhat different than Secretary Clinton's use of her commercial account, yet I was 'fired' for the use of Gmail in the U.S. Embassy, my insistence on improving our physical security posture, and other twisted and false allegations.  I've chosen to move on and to be better, not bitter."" He said that ""the State Department Inspector General investigators and Diplomatic Security cyber investigators conducted a full and formal investigation into my use of Gmail and the State Department computers"" and ""they dismissed the allegations against me."" The former ambassador and his wife currently live in Kenya, where he is executive chairman of a company that works to bring international investment and innovation to Kenya and East Africa. He is no longer involved in US politics and diplomacy.","Fmr. ambassador forced to resign in 2012 amidst criticism over personal email use at the State Department.
Claims accusations against him unwarranted. He took issue with State Dept. security protocol because they used the same firewall as Gmail.
Although his experience was somewhat different than Hillary Clinton's, he was ""was very surprised to learn of the double standard.""","Here is a multi-sentence summary of the key points from the article:

- Former U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Scott Gration was surprised to learn that Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State when he was fired in 2012, also used a private email account for official business - a practice for which he was criticized.  
- Gration says he was ""prohibited from sending a Gmail message to a State Department computer"" due to security concerns, but Clinton's team allowed her to use a private email server.
- The State Department Inspector General report cited issues with Gration's leadership and stated private email usage violated policy, though Gration claims the allegations were twisted to justify his termination.
- Gration maintains he did nothing illegal or unethical, and an investigation cleared him of allegations about his Gmail use, but he was still fired while Clinton faced no consequences for similar conduct.

Li (circled) was caught on CCTV eating the poisoned lolly before he played hide and seek . This is the spot where Li picked up the poisoned lolly . Deadly: This is the lolly that Li ate, reportedly . Tragically, the lolly was covered in a substance 100 times more toxic than cyanide. His pals ran to get help and found Li's dad Jin Hsueh, 45 who discovered his son, still unconscious, was bleeding from his eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth. He said: 'They told me that Li was lying behind a bush where he had been hiding from them during a game. 'When I got there he was hardly breathing and I knew something terrible had happened.' Li was rushed to the nearby Jining Affiliated Medical School Hospital, where medics quickly realised the condition was critical. Heartbreak: Li's father found his son in a critical condition, bleeding from his eyes, ears, nostrils and mouth . The lolly that Li put in his mouth was covered in TETS, or tetramethylenedisulfotetramine. It's an odorless and tasteless poison that's fatal for humans in quantities of just 7 to 10mg and above. It is 100 times more toxic than cyanide and there is no known antidote. It was banned around the world in 1984 but still finds its way into China in rat poison, as it's very easy to produce. A hospital spokesman said: 'His internal organs had been destroyed by the poison and his blood had turned black.' Doctors fought to save him for two days before little Li succumbed to the poison and died. Tests carried out on the lollipop which the boy still had on him showed that it had been coated in TETS, a highly lethal neurotoxin found in rat poison. Its use worldwide has been banned since 1984 but is still readily available in China, although illegally. Now police suspect someone close to the family may have been responsible for his death. A police spokesman said: 'We have checked the location of where the lollipop was in the family's yard and we found a couple more. 'The only way they could have got there is if someone walked in and put them there as it is impossible to reach from the road. 'And if they had been thrown over the wall, they would have broken.

The tool works in a similar way to its 'tailored notifications' and involves scanning tweets for abusive or offensive words, threats or signs of harassment. It will automatically remove these tweets from a user's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site. Twitter's 'Quality Filter' will scan tweets for abusive or offensive words and threats. It will automatically remove these tweets from a user's notification timeline and repeat offenders may be suspended from the site. It was spotted by Twitter user Anil Dash (pictured) and is only currently available to verified users . The tool was first spotted by Twitter user Anil Dash who wrote: 'Well, that's an interesting and welcome addition, Twitter! (Was prompted about this on opening the app.)' Mr Dash is a verified Twitter user, meaning he has a blue tick on his account. These blue ticks are to confirm that the accounts of high-profile, influential people and celebrities are real and not parodies, for example. A Twitter spokesman said the feature is only currently available for these verified users and did not reveal if it will be rolled out further. It is likely due to the fact such celebrities fall victim to more abuse and harassment than regular users, but Twitter did not confirm this. From Mr Dash's tweet it appears the filter is opt-in. Last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its new rules (pictured) say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. The site said it will verify complaints and suspended abusive users . Reports recently claimed Twitter will  start banning trolls and abusive users by tracking email addresses and phone numbers. When people sign up by email they are also given the option to add a phone number (pictured). In the future, Twitter may  ban accounts accused of abuse until they provide this number . Twitter already lets people block, report or mute people who are sending them abusive messages. Last week the site took aim at the rising levels of revenge porn and stolen nude photos posted to the social network. Its rules now say that users must not 'post intimate photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent'. Twitter said an affected user can report a post if they believe it contains photos or videos posted without their consent. Stories of abuse, threats and internet trolls have become commonplace on Twitter in recent years. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the social platform last year after being sent disturbing images in the wake of her father's suicide. Feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian was threatened with rape, sexual violence and death by Twitter trolls during the 'Gamergate' saga after she criticised the way women are portrayed in video games. In the UK, journalist Caroline Criado-Perez also received rape threats after she voiced her support for the campaign to introduce Jane Austen as the new face of the £10 note. Twitter users Isabella Sorley and John Nimmo admitted sending the messages to Ms Criado-Perez and both were jailed last year. Under copyright laws the video or photos technically belong to the person who took it and who can, in theory, distribute it as they see fit but Twitter's rules additionally considers the people in the footage. It will ask the person reporting the abuse to verify they are the person in the post and that it was posted without their permission. Twitter said 'agents will then act on content posted in violation of the policy', including removing the post or suspending the accounts of repeat offenders. The changes follow reports Twitter would start banning users who violate its rules by tracking  email addresses and phone numbers. This means that if an offender attempts to sign up for other accounts using these details Twitter will be able to intervene. Last month an internal memo sent by Twitter's chief executive Dick Costolo revealed the 51-year-old thinks his site 'sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls'. In the memo, Mr Costolo said  he is embarrassed by the way the company handles abuse and that it must take stronger action in the future. Mr Costolo's comments were posted on an internal forum among Twitter employees, after one employee raised the question of what more could be done to tackle online abuse. In December, a blog post titled 'Building a safer Twitter' revealed  Twitter is working on ways to make it easier to block and report abuse. The site has since improved the reporting process to make it more mobile-friendly, and it now requires less initial information. It has also improved the ways in which abuse can be reported to law enforcement.","Twitter is currently trialling the feature on accounts of verified users only .

A furniture boss is facing jail after his company produced a cot that nearly caused the death of two young children. Philip Dickens admitted his company, Baumhaus, supplied an unsafe item at Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire, today. The firm produced the Nutkin cot bed which was blamed for incidents where two children 'came very close to very serious harm or death,' the court heard. Dickens, described as 'the king of DIY' on a profile on the Baumhaus website, could now face a jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000. The site says the solid hardwood Nutkin cot, a modified version of which is still being sold, is suitable for children aged 0 to 12 years as it 'transforms easily from cot into stunning sleigh bed.' It says the cot is 'extremely versatile' and can be set to three different heights. In 2013, Baumhaus released a product recall for the original design of the cot, explaining that parts of the bed, particularly the gaps at the top, had been identified as a potential trap-hazard. A notice published online by consumer watchdog Which? said there is a 'risk of children trapping their head and neck in the gaps at the top.' It added: 'A child's legs or arms could become trapped between the end slat of the drop-down side of some products sold.' The company, which produces a number of ranges of furniture, has since modified the design and it is available from a number of retailers for around £500. The company, which produces a number of ranges of furniture, has since modified the design of the cot and it is available from a number of retailers for around £500. Above, the three-drawer Nutkin cot . Appearing in court today on behalf of Baumhaus, Dickens was told he could face up to 12 months behind bars or a fine of up to £20,000 for the offences. Baumhaus recalled the cot bed in December 2013. At the time, consumer watchdog Which? released a notice detailing the risks presented by the bed, advising readers to stop using the cot immediately. The risks included: . Alex Greenwood, prosecuting the case on behalf of the Trading Standards Institute, told the court, sitting at Amersham, Buckinghamshire, that Baumhaus and its director had been neglectful. Mr Greenwood said: 'As a result, three individuals received that product and used it. In the case of two children they came very close to very serious harm and/or death. 'They placed it on the market and it was subsequently supplied and the incidents occurred.' Entering pleas on the company's behalf, Dickens pleaded guilty to two counts of placing an unsafe product on the market between January 2010 and July 2013. Dickens was referred to personally in one of the charges. Mr Greenwood said: 'This is a small company. He is the director. Anything that has been done is attributable to his neglect.' Judge Karen Holt told Dickens they were 'serious' offences. She said: 'You know what happened to those two young children. All options ought to be considered.' Dickens, from Burnley, Lancashire, was released on bail to return for sentencing on April 13.","Philip Dickens admitted his company, Baumhaus, produced unsafe item .

Researchers have shown that light pollution can impact the natural environment in complex ways that may be hard to predict. Given that cities are lit up 24-hours-a-day in many developed countries, there are fears that such ecological impacts may be widespread. Researchers have shown that light pollution can impact the natural environment in complex ways that may be hard to predict. This image shows the two different types of light treatment used - ‘white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating a type of sodium street lamp . Researchers from the University of Exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing a community of invertebrates at night. They exposed them to two different types of light treatment - a ‘white' light similar to newer commercial LED street lighting systems and an 'amber' light simulating the type of sodium street lamp still found in much of the UK and further afield. The experiments investigated the effects of the lighting on the population density of a species of pea aphid. The low intensity amber light was shown to prevent flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid-summer. The study showed that low intensity amber light caused by street lighting in cities (a stock image of London at dusk is shown) prevented flowering in a wild relative of peas and beans called greater bird's foot trefoil, which is a key source of food for the pea aphid in grasslands and road verges, especially in mid summer . Bright lights in Europe’s cities may be causing urban blackbirds to reach sexual maturity quicker their country cousins. Animal biologists from Glasgow University and the Max Planck Institute for Orntihology in Seewiesen, near Munich, fitted tiny light loggers to the backs of 100 blackbirds in the city of Munich and in a nearby forest. The light loggers tracked the amount of light birds in both environments were exposed to each day and sent the data to experts. They found that the additional light from artificial sources caused the city birds to perceive the days to be longer by 49 minutes on average. The additional light had an effect on the city birds’ photoperiod, which is the part of the day that organisms use to time their daily and seasonal biology. As a result, the birds in early March experienced the day length that their country counterparts experienced in late March, according to the study published in journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. The city birds’ perception that they were living at a later point in the year caused them to reach sexual maturity in anticipation of breeding season 19 days earlier than the forest birds. Study leader Dr Davide Dominoni of the university, said: ‘Artificial light at night is one of the most obvious environmental changes affecting the habitat of wild animals. ‘The global increase in light pollution poses new challenges to wild species, but we’re very much in the early stages of understanding the effects of exposure to light at night.' They found that the number of aphids declined under the light treatment in mid-August due to the limited amount of food available. Professor Kevin Gaston, Director of the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI) said: ‘These are the first findings from major long-term experiments … and already reveal how profound the impacts of artificial night time lighting can be on even simple communities of organisms.’ Dr Jonathan Bennie added: ‘Our results suggest that by lighting up our night time environment we trigger complex effects on natural food webs. ‘While we are all aware that street lights often attract insects at night, we show that they may have more permanent, widespread impacts on wildlife and ecosystems.’ Another study carried out at the university, along with Bat Conservation Ireland, revealed that bats don’t like streetlights either and that activity was generally lower in street-lit areas than in dark locations with similar habitat. The findings have important implications for conservation, overturning the previous assumption that common bats benefited from street-lights because they could feed on the insects that congregated around them. The research, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, found that the activity of soprano pipistrelle, noctule and serotine bats was similar or lower in areas with street lighting compared with dark areas. An increase in the activity of the UK’s most common bat, the common pipistrelle, was only seen in locations where there was also a high amount of shelter from trees or hedgerows. The only species for which lighting appeared favourable was Leisler’s bat, a species common in Ireland but rare in Britain. Dr Fiona Mathews said: ‘People rarely see bats, and when they do it is usually because they are silhouetted by a light. ‘Because clouds of insects accumulate around lights, there has been an assumption that the bats were getting an easy lunch. Another study carried out at the university, along with Bat Conservation Ireland, revealed that bats don’t like streetlights either and are less active around them. An increase in the activity of the UK’s most common bat, the common pipistrelle (stock image), was only seen in sheltered locations . ‘What our work shows is that they are actually usually just as active, if not more so, in adjacent dark areas. ‘We already knew that lighting was bad news for rare species such as horseshoe bats. ‘Now we have demonstrated that, for the common species of vital importance to our ecosystem, lighting is not helpful. Over recent decades, the number of streetlights, and the brightness of lighting, has grown enormously. ‘We also use increasingly powerful lights to illuminate outdoor areas around our homes. We urgently need to reverse this trend.’ The research analysed large-scale surveys conducted in Britain and Ireland, involving more than 265,000 bat calls at over 600 locations. The links between lighting and bats were explored at several spatial scales including car-surveys conducted by volunteers across Ireland, to shorter surveys conducted by bicycle, and detailed monitoring over multiple nights at specific sites. Despite frequently being depicted as blind, bats have good eyesight that is adapted for low light conditions. Dr Mathews explained: ‘When we walk out of a lit house into the dark, it takes a while for our eyes to adapt to the darkness. ‘The same is true in bats – they are dazzled by bright light and it takes time for their eyes to re-adjust. This could affect their ability to navigate. ‘In addition, it seems that their ability to hunt insects is reduced in the light. So although a bat may be seen flying round and round a streetlamp, it may actually be struggling to catch anything.’ In Februrary, a study claimed that humans and the urban enviornments we've created have affected the evolution of a whole host of species - triggering the growth of enormous spiders, the shrinking of fish and the emergence of birds with no fear of man. And the changes are happening faster than previously thought which ‘may have significant implications for ecological and human well-being,’ according to one expert. Maria Alberti, of the University of Washington College of Built Environments, said that until recently, it was assumed that evolutionary change would take too long to affect ecological processes immediately. ‘We now have evidence that there is rapid evolution. These changes may affect the state of the environment now. This is what's called eco-evolutionary feedback,’ she said. A new study claims that animals living in cities have evolved rapidly because of human influence. For example, Pacific salmon (b) have become smaller, blackbirds (d) have changed their migratory behaviour, Crespis sancta (e) disperses less seeds in built-up areas, earthworms (f) have become tolerant to metal, while white-footed mice (c) are carrying more ticks, leading to increased cases of Lyme Disease in humans . Professor Alberti explained that the number and variety of animals living in cities has not simply decreased, but humans are causing them to evolve rapidly. ‘Many species of mammals, birds, fishes, and insects have learned novel behaviours, such as diet, foraging skills, and anti-predator behaviour,’ the study says. For example, it cites research that found the bodies of fish changed in response to the construction of dams and that Pacific salmon have become smaller in urban areas. In contrast, a study published in August last year found that spiders are growing larger in cities than in rural environments. Professor Alberti said that changes in animals have an effect on ‘ecosystem functions such as biodiversity, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, detoxification, food production and ultimately on human health and well-being.’ In addition to the growing spiders and shrinking salmon, she cited earthworms with increased tolerance to metals and seeds of some plants dispersing less effectively. Earthworms have adapted genetically to a series of soil contaminates, including arsenic and certain plants also have also developed an increased tolerance for heavy metals in brownfield sites in cities. Worryingly, the study also points to evidence of changes in a type of urban mouse, that may have health consequences for humans. Some white-footed mice in New York were found to be a ‘critical host’ for black-legged ticks that carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Professor Alberti’s study says that thriving mouse populations allow more ticks to survive and lead to predictable spikes in human exposure to the illness. It also discusses how songbirds are becoming tamer and bolder, as well as changing their tunes to ensure their acoustic signals are not lost in the noisy urban background.","Researchers from the University of Exeter simulated the effects of street lighting on artificial grassland plots containing insects .
They exposed them to two types of light spewed out by streetlamps .
Found amber light stopped a wild relative of peas flowering .
Plant is a key source of food for aphids and their numbers declined .
Other studies have shown that bats are less active around artificial lighting and that blackbirds reach sexual maturity faster .","Here is a multi-sentence summary of the key points from the article:

- Research shows artificial light at night from street lamps and other sources impacts plant growth, flowering patterns, and insect populations in complex ways. 
- Experiments found low-intensity amber street lighting prevented flowering in a plant that is a key food source for pea aphids, causing aphid populations to decline in mid-summer due to lack of food.
- Studies on urban birds like blackbirds revealed artificial light exposure caused them to reach sexual maturity earlier than rural birds by altering their perception of day length.
- While thought to benefit from insects attracted to lights, research found most bat species actually had similar or lower activity levels in street-lit areas compared to dark environments.
- The increasing prevalence and brightness of outdoor lighting is negatively impacting many common urban species vital to ecosystems.
- Rapid evolutionary changes are occurring in urban animals like shrinking fish, larger spiders, seed dispersal changes, and mice carrying more disease-spreading ticks due to human influences.",0.0,"Carefully analyze the given text to comprehend the key events, central ideas, and supporting details.

Speaking to ABC News, Joshua Kinlaw said 'it hit my heart' when he found out his friend had been involved in the bloody arrest outside the Trinity Irish Pub in Charlottesville early on Wednesday. 'There is nothing he could've said or done that could provoke an officer of the law to assault him in such a manner,' he said. He added that contrary to the officers' suspicions, Johnson did not have a fake ID and had presented his real identification when a bar employee asked to see it. Scroll down for videos . Defense: Joshua Kinlaw, pictured speaking to ABC News, said 'it hit my heart' when he found out his friend, Martese Johnson, had been involved in the bloody arrest early on Wednesday morning . 'So the ID that he actually showed to both the bouncer and to the ABC [Alcoholic Beverage Control] officers was his real ID,' he said. 'Now because the age on that ID shows him to be 20 years old, I think that's when dispute and discrepancies came in.' After being turned away from the bar and questioned by police, Johnson was forced to the ground and pinned down. His bloodied face, caused by a gash to his head, was captured on camera and shared across social media. The student was charged with public intoxication and or swearing and obstruction of justice for the St Patrick's Day night incident outside the Trinity Irish Pub. He was released Wednesday morning. Kinlaw said he believed the incident was race-related because so many other students on campus try to get into bars when they are underage but do not face the same sorts of assaults. On Thursday, Johnson's lawyer, Daniel Watkins, shared the same story. Hurt: Johnson can be seen on the pavement after the scuffle with officers in the early hours of Wednesday . He explained that Johnson, a junior at UVA, was standing near the Trinity Irish Pub after midnight when a bouncer approached him and asked for his ID. He asked Johnson about his zip code, and Johnson gave his mother's current zip code in Chicago, which is different from the old one listed on his current Illinois license, Watkins said. Officers then questioned Johnson about being in possession of false identification, even though the ID was his, Watkins said. 'At no point during the encounter ... did Martese present a fake ID,' Watkins said. They forced him to the ground, pinned him down and handcuffed as his head began bleeding, Watkins said. Johnson did not speak at the news conference, but Watkins read a statement on his behalf, saying: 'I trust that the scars on my face and head will heal but the trauma from what the ABC officers did will stay with me forever.' He said he planned to fight the charges. Johnson, seen here on Thursday, was charged with public intoxication and obstruction of justice. He said through his lawyer, right, that he was 'shocked that my face was slammed into the brick pavement' The student (center) reportedly said the ZIP code of the address where his mother (left center, with son Michael, left) currently lives rather than the one listed on the ID he gave to Alcoholic Beverage Control officers . 'I still believe in our community. I know this community will support me during this time,' he said in the statement. Protests erupted at the campus following the arrest. On Wednesday night, a thousand students gathered on the prestigious campus to demand justice for their classmate. Johnson, a full scholarship student who had 10 stitches across his forehead, joined the protests, although he did not refer directly to the incident on advice of his lawyer. 'Regardless of your personal opinions and the way you feel about subjects to please respect everyone up here, we're all part of one community,' he told the crowd. School President Theresa Sullivan made a brief appearance on the grassy field, but only spoke to several reporters and did not make any formal remarks to the crowd. She released a statement saying that she was 'deeply concerned' 'contacted the Governor's office to ask for an independent investigation of the incident.' On Wednesday night, hundreds of students gathered at the University of Virginia campus to demand justice for Johnson. There was also a separate march through the town . The hashtag #JusticeForMartese was posted thousands of times on Twitter and student protesters have used the phrase 'black lives matter' and said that the arrest of Johnson (second from left) was racially motivated . 'The safety and security of our students will always be my primary concern, and every member of our community should feel safe from the threat of bodily harm and other forms of violence,' the statement read. Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo is expected to attend an open dialogue with UVA students on Friday to discuss his force's relationship to them. The Virginia State Police Association said Thursday that it was launching an administrative review and criminal investigation into the incident. Police will conduct the criminal investigation along with the City of Charlottesville Commonwealth's Attorney. The officers involved in the incident have been put on desk duty. Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe's office had released a statement Wednesday that called for state police to examine 'the use of force' by liquor control officers. ABC agents in Charlottesville have been accused of heavy-handed actions in the past. The state of Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement last year with a UVA student who was arrested after her purchase of water was mistaken for beer. Johnson, pictured left, is an honor student at the university, which has seen a string of controversies this year . Scene: The incident  occurred as Johnson stood outside Trinity Irish Pub just blocks from the campus . Elizabeth Daly fled in terror outside a Charlottesville supermarket in April 2013 when her vehicle was swarmed by state ABC agents who mistook her just-purchased carton of sparkling water for an alcoholic beverage. According to Daly's lawsuit, badges worn around the casually dressed ABC agents' necks were not clearly visible and the defendants did not verbally identify themselves as officers. Daly was charged with eluding police and assaulting a police officer after her SUV grazed two of the agents. The arrest provoked a public outcry, and the charges were dropped. Johnson is scheduled to appear in court on March 26. See below for video . Tragedy: University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, 18, pictured, was found dead in October . Murdered student Hannah Graham . University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, 18, went missing in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving a bar at 2am on September 13. The sophomore's remains were discovered buried in a shallow grave in a densely wooded area of Albemarle County, eight miles from Charlottesville, in mid-October following a month-long search. Jesse Matthew Jr.has been charged with first-degree murder. Rolling Stone fraternity rape allegations . The University of Virginia fraternity was hit with allegations of gang rape in a Rolling Stone article. A police investigation  turned up no evidence of the alleged sexual assault. Phi Kappa Psi was suspended in November, after Rolling Stone published a story featuring a UVA junior named 'Jackie' who claimed to have been brutally gang-raped by a group of men at the fraternity during her freshman year. All fraternities and sororities at the Charlottesville, Virginia campus were temporarily suspended in the wake of the controversial article, which provoked protests on campus over the school's relaxed prosecution of sexual assault reports. Loss: Peter D'Agostino, 20, pictured, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound last year . However, the article later came into question when the Washington Post highlighted several discrepancies in the story - throwing doubt on whether the incident. D'Agostino heir takes his life . Tragedy struck the already reeling University of Virginia campus in November when a 20-year-old student and heir to New York City supermarket fortune took his life.

The officer fired two shots when the man charged at him, said Cedric Alexander, the public safety director of DeKalb County. But given that the man was not carrying a weapon, the police department immediately turned over the case to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations for an independent probe. ""What I have requested here [is] a result of what's going on currently across this country as it relates to police shootings,"" Alexander told reporters. The officer was white; the deceased man was African-American, Alexander said. The incident took place Monday afternoon at an apartment complex in Chamblee, a suburb of Atlanta. Someone called 911 to report a man ""acting deranged, knocking on doors and crawling around naked,"" Alexander said. When the officer arrived, the man charged at him, Alexander said. ""The officer called him to stop while stepping backward, drew his weapon and fired two shots,"" he said. The man, struck twice in the upper body, died. Police later learned he was a resident at the complex. ""I can only reasonably assume that if he was running around the apartment  complex naked, I believe we can make the assumption there may have been some mental health experience that he might have been having,"" Alexander said. DeKalb County police officers undergo some degree of training on how to deal with the mentally ill. But this, and other incidents, highlight the need for more, the public safety director said. ""That's becoming more and more apparent,"" Alexander said. ""We have already, as many departments have begun to do, look at how to expand our mental health training when we find it certainly necessary to do so. Because it appears that we're seeing more and more of these cases across the country in which police are engaging with those who appear to be in distress."" Police did not release the officer's name, but said the seven-year veteran was placed on administrative leave. During the incident, the officer had access to his stun gun and pepper spray, Alexander said.  Why he chose to draw his weapon will come out during the investigation. ""I think in all fairness we need to wait and see what the outcome of the investigation is because I can't tell you, beyond what I have told you so far, what kind of measures that officer may have taken,"" he said. As fatal police shootings come under increased scrutiny in the current climate, police departments also appear to be more forthcoming in proactively releasing information for transparency's sake. Such is the case in Madison, Wisconsin, where Madison Police Chief Mike Koval has been out front and outspoken about the shooting death of  19-year-old Tony Robinson at the hands of an officer. And it seems to be the case in this DeKalb County incident. ""If you look at the state in this country and the things we're going through right now across this country with police-involved shooting, certainly it's a concern to many Americans. And there has certainly been recommendations that have been made in regards to moving towards more independent type of investigations,"" he said.","Police: Officer fired two shots when the man charged at him .

David Bland was researching Mr Weston's history when he discovered that he had never received his gongs and wrote to the Ministry of Defence last month. Just a few days later  shiny Defence Medal and War Medal arrived at the home Mr Weston shares with his wife Margaret.

Mr Revett, 49, said: 'They do look like little mushroom men. 'It's really strange how their shape makes them look like they have a head and arms. That's what drew my attention to them.' Despite first spotting them in 2000, the fungus was dismissed as a species of earthstar fungi which is prevalent in Norfolk. Having been interested in mycology - the study of fungus - for more than 40 years, Mr Revett sent them off to Kew Gardens for testing. The fungus, found in Cockley Cley, Norfolk, has fleshy off-shoots that appear to resemble human heads, arms and legs . However, 15 years later, mycologists in Spain carried out DNA sequence analysis and have just confirmed they differ slightly. Mr Revett - who runs the mycology website fenfungi.com - said: 'It felt brilliant knowing I'd found something new. 'I wouldn't normally question the experts but I just knew these were different. 'I go back to the site every year doing tours and they're always there.

But is it a patriotic photograph or desecration of the American flag? Navy veteran Vanessa Hicks, a Virginia Beach photographer whose website is filled with sweet images of babies and their parents, shot the picture of the sailor and his baby and posted it to her Facebook page. ""I do believe that this picture right here shows what it means to be an American,"" Hicks told CNN affiliate WTKR.""That flag, the uniform, that baby -- exactly what every service member is out there fighting."" Not everyone agreed with Hicks, herself a Navy wife whose husband is deployed. A Facebook page titled ""You call yourself a photographer?"" posted her photo and said that the use of the flag as a prop was a desecration -- and a bad picture. The U.S. Flag Code does state that the flag should never be used as ""wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free,"" according to a Congressional Research Service report (PDF). Nor should it be ""used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything."" The threatening private messages, which she has reported to Facebook, saddened her. But she decided to keep posting the picture and to take pictures of other members of the military who request the same picture with their babies and the flag. Most people posting to the critical Facebook page disagree with the criticism of the picture. Wrote one poster, ""I am a veteran and find this picture beautiful. Clearly the military member loves his country and baby."" ""The photo is making a point,"" another photo fan posted. ""The flag represents our republic, the republic is supporting our future.

It turns out a lot more than most of the rest of us. Gross, 65, has started to make up for the five years he spent imprisoned in Cuba by traveling abroad, attending the State of the Union address as a guest of the Obamas and last week meeting Pope Francis at the Vatican to personally thank him for his role in helping to win Gross' freedom. After five years of being disconnected from the outside world, Gross now frequently posts on social media, writing of family reunions, eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in Cuba. ""I can't get away from Cuba,"" Gross wrote after hearing a Cuban song playing in an airport on his travels. While visiting Israel, he posted a photo of Cohiba cigars advertised for sale in a Tel Aviv tobacco shop. In 2009, Gross was arrested by Cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island. Gross said he was merely helping the island's small Jewish community get online, but Cuban officials accused of him being part of a U.S. government plot to destabilize the island's single-party Communist government. Cuba has highly restricted Internet access, and most people are not able to access the Web in their homes or on their phones. On December 17, 2014, Gross was freed, along with three Cuban intelligence agents and a Cuban man convicted of spying for the United States. It was part of a deal between the Cuban and U.S. governments to reestablish diplomatic relations after five decades of Cold War animosity. Gross, his wife, Judy, his attorney and three U.S. congressmen flew from Havana to his home state of Maryland aboard a U.S. military jet, one of the smaller versions of Air Force One used to transport President Barack Obama. The image of Gross celebrating his freedom aboard the flight home with CNN reporting the news of his release on a TV screen in the background became the picture he would use on his @AlanPGross Twitter page. The night of his release, he enjoyed a meal of spicy Thai food with family and friends, a far cry from the bland rations he was forced to eat in prison. In January, Gross changed the status of his Facebook page to read that he had left his job as ""hostage"" at the Carlos Finlay military hospital where had been held in Havana. Later, he shared pictures of a visit to the dentist's office to replace the teeth that he lost while he was held in Cuba. With his dental concerns met, he moved on to food. Gross also recounted savoring long-denied bowls of chili and bagels loaded with lox and cream cheese. Many of the posts are the daily jottings of a man returning to his life after an extended absence: Gross renewing an expired driver's license or visiting a Starbucks for the first time in five years. But in other posts, he writes about taking in a sunset on the beach in Israel, seeing the snow fall in Washington and believing citizens in every country should have unimpeded access to the Internet. A spokeswoman for Gross turned down a CNN request for an interview with him but confirmed that the social media accounts are his. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat representing the Maryland district Gross hails from, called it ""incredibly moving"" that a man who spent five years in a Cuban prison has since sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and met the pope. More than that, he's come to signify the changing dynamics between officials in Washington and Havana. ""Alan did not ask for this special role in history,"" Van Hollen said, ""but he's become a catalyst for this new chapter in American and Cuban relations."" The photos that Gross posted online show a smiling man, slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison, no longer the gaunt-faced, hollow-eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in Cuba. ""The distance we've come since December 17th 2014 has been a rewarding journey,"" Gross wrote in a Facebook post Saturday. ""For which we're grateful.""","Rep. Van Hollen: Alan Gross became ""a catalyst"" for next chapter in U.S.-Cuba relations .

- Alan Gross, a U.S. State Department subcontractor, has been actively traveling and engaging in activities since his release from a Cuban prison three months ago after being held for five years on accusations of trying to destabilize the Cuban government. 

- Since his release as part of a deal to restore diplomatic ties between the U.S. and Cuba, the 65-year-old Gross has been reconnecting with aspects of life he missed in prison, like enjoying particular foods, meeting influential figures like the Pope, and frequently posting about his experiences on social media.

- Gross's case and release have symbolic significance, with a U.S. Congressman describing him as a ""catalyst"" representing the new chapter in U.S.-Cuban relations after decades of tensions - his posts and activities highlight his journey in resuming his life while still carrying reminders of his Cuban imprisonment.

- Key details are provided about Gross's activities since release, including renewing his driver's license, getting dental work, savoring foods he missed, meeting political figures, traveling internationally, and reflecting on his experiences through frequent social media posts capturing both mundane and profound moments.",0.0,"Analyze the given text thoroughly to extract the key information and logically connect the different components.

The latest figures from Roy Morgan  show that socioeconomic status and family income have a significant impact on foods consumed. At the top end of the scale, children eat more salad and rice, but as income decreases more chips, wedges, chicken nuggets and noodles are consumed. New research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads . In the wealthiest households, 62 per cent of kids aged 6-13 will eat rice every week, while 55 per cent will also have salad at some stage. Less than half will eat hot chips, fries, or wedges, while just over a third will consume noodles. Around a quarter of these children will eat chicken nuggets during an average week. However at the other end of the spectrum childrens' eating habits change quite dramatically. With each successive drop in socioeconomic status, children in the household are less likely to eat rice or salad, and more likely to eat noodles or chicken nuggets. Kids from wealthier families will see more salad on the table, with 55 per cent consuming the greens in an average week . At the lower end of the scale 60 per cent of children will consume chips, wedges or fries, but only 44 per cent will eat a salad during an average week. Noodles are on the menu for 55 per cent of these kids, chicken nuggets are eaten by 40 per cent, and just half of these children will see rice on their table. 'While the food that parents buy and give to their children is heavily influenced by the affordability of groceries, there may be many other issues at play such as the number of children (and parents) in the household, working hours, accessibility of fresh produce in the local area, as well as underlying attitudes and tastes,' Michele Levine, CEO, Roy Morgan Research said. The presence of rice at mealtimes has increased, and 62 per cent of kids at the higher end of the spectrum have it each week . 'For example, price alone does not fully explain the inverse changes in popularity for rice and noodles among children across socio-economic quintiles.' The research also revealed that more parents are trying to make a conscious choice about purchasing additive-free food, which is up to 50 per cent from 45 last year. However figures in this section also show that as socioeconomic status declines, so does the amount of parents making the decision to buy additive-free foods. Noodles and hot chips are eaten more frequently than salads in lower socioeconomic households . Despite this, increasing numbers of parents are paying closer attention to what they put on the table for their children. 'More than five million Australians are parents with children under 16 in the home. Our research into health attitudes shows that over the last five years an increasing proportion of parents are mindful of their own calorie, fat, dairy, and red meat intake, but are slightly less likely to be trying to limit how much sugar their kids eat,' Michele Levine said. 'Our Single Source survey can connect parents' demographics and household status with their health attitudes, grocery shopping behaviours, exercise habits and food consumption rates to deliver a 360-degree view of the changing lifestyles of Australian families.' Noodles are on the menu each week more often for children whose parents earn a lower income, over wealthier families .","New research shows children from lower income families are more frequently consuming chips than they are salads .

- Children from wealthier families are more likely to consume salads and rice, while those from poorer households eat more chips, wedges, chicken nuggets, and noodles on a weekly basis. 
- The research revealed an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and the consumption of healthier foods like salads and rice versus unhealthier options like chips and noodles.
- While affordability plays a role, other factors such as family size, working hours, accessibility to fresh produce, and attitudes/tastes also influence the dietary choices made by parents for their children across different income levels.
- The data showed that higher-income families had 62% of children eating rice and 55% eating salads weekly, compared to only 50% having rice and 44% having salads in lower-income households.
- On the other hand, 60% of kids from poorer families ate chips/fries weekly versus under 50% in wealthier homes, and noodle consumption was 55% for lower-income children but lower for affluent families.
- The findings also indicated a trend of more parents consciously choosing additive-free foods, but this practice declined along with socioeconomic status.
- Overall, the research highlighted significant disparities in the diets of Australian children based on family income levels and socioeconomic backgrounds.",0.8800000000000001,"Analyze the given text thoroughly to extract the key information and logically connect the different components.

Her vow  to fight online harassment came after she says she was attacked for expressing an unpopular opinion about a basketball game on Twitter. Judd, a diehard Kentucky Wildcats fan who regularly attends March Madness games, told MSNBC that her tweet to the effect of ""I think Arkansas is playing dirty"" was met with vile language and sexually charged threats. Judd retweeted messages that are too explicit to include here. ""Everyone needs to take personal responsibility for what they write and not allowing this misinterpretation and shaming culture on social media to persist,"" Judd said. ""And by the way I'm pressing charges."" The actor, who is also an advocate for women's rights, added: ""The amount of gender violence that I experience is absolutely extraordinary, and a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that's directed at me on social media."" Twitter, trolls and sports collided recently in another high-profile social media fight involving former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling. Schilling had congratulated his daughter on joining her new college's softball team in a tweet that was met with sexually menacing replies. He tracked down some of the men who sent inappropriate tweets, resulting in one reportedly being fired from his part-time job with the New York Yankees. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has admitted the company has a less than stellar track record for cracking down on abusive tweets. ""We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform and we've sucked at it for years,"" Costolo wrote in a February memo. He told employees that he was embarrassed and took ""personal responsibility"" for the company's failure to address abuse. Costolo said he was committed to addressing the issue. This month the company updated its terms of service to directly combat so-called ""revenge porn"" that is posted to the site. Revenge porn is sexually explicit material posted online without the consent of one or more participants. Just today, the company debuted a new feature it says will make the process of reporting abusive tweets to law enforcement more seamless. The site will now email a report that can be shared with law enforcement after a user reports an abusive tweet. ""While we take threats of violence seriously and will suspend responsible accounts when appropriate, we strongly recommend contacting your local law enforcement if you're concerned about your physical safety,"" Twitter says.

Yet, it struggles to attract and retain girls. How can football serve as a tool of socialization when it remains the domain of young boys and men? Algeria coach Christian Gourcuff, who has a coached a number of Ligue 1 clubs, notes that for a long time, women's football ""was a sport totally marginalized."" Stereotypes abounded that the sport was too rough, too masculine for girls to play. They were much more likely to compete in basketball, ride horseback, or dance, such as Maïmouna Coulibaly, whose dance company, Les Ambianceuses, is internationally recognized (though overshadowed by her brother, Amedy Coulibaly, the kosher supermarket shooter in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo massacre). But change is afoot. Since the late 1980s, the French Football Federation (FFF) has promoted the sport to women and girls. ""Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable development of the women's game,"" said Gourcuff. Former player and ex-Paris Saint-Germain official Jean-Michel Moutier concurred. Over the past decade ""girls have significantly increased the level of play,"" he said. ""I am agreeably surprised by the quality of certain female football matches."" The sport's increased television presence helps significantly, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup. ""That has changed a bit the image of women's football,"" Gourcuff said, ""notably among young girls."" Farid El Alagui, who now plays for Scottish club Hibernian, noticed a dramatic difference in how women's football is perceived back home. ""If you look at the French national team,"" he said, ""they've been really good."" Les Bleues are presently third in FIFA's world ranking and hopes are high for their success at the women's World Cup in Canada between June 6 and July 5. The professional women's league is also responsible for encouraging more girls to play. ""There are big clubs like Paris Saint-Germain,"" El Alagui said, ""who are very good and the level of play is quite high."" Such examples foster confidence to try to the sport. ""I think a lot of girls want to play football,"" he said. ""They're just scared."" However, enrollment statistics paint a less exuberant portrait. At ASVCM only seven out of 345 players in the club's football school are girls, and two more play with the club's youth teams in competitions. Such statistics are mirrored nationally. During the 2013-14 season, there were 50,516 licensed girls in the Under-6 to Under-20 demographic, as compared to 997,511 for boys of the same age. While few in number, the young girls at ASVCM -- a local sports club based in a town 12 kilometers south of Paris -- are welcomed and respected, observed Catherine Ledemé, who has volunteered with the club for more than a decade. ""They are often the 'mascots' of the team,"" she said. Moreover, they excel on the field. The football section's president Marc Girard proudly boasted that two of ASVCM's young players are in formation with PSG's women's team. For Ledemé, who week-in and week-out ensures the club's conviviality, ""football has strong social values."" She supports girls playing football, regardless of the game's stereotypes or image, a sentiment indicative of changing or changed attitudes. More is needed, but the continued success of the women's league and national team will perhaps inspire more girls to take up the sport.","French women's football has long been marginalized, stereotyped as a sport that is too rough and masculine for girls to play .
In recent years an increased television presence has raised the profile of the game, especially broadcasts of the women's World Cup .

However, efforts by the French Football Federation since the late 1980s to promote the sport to women and girls have helped change perceptions. 

- Over the past decade, the increasing quality and television exposure of women's football, particularly the French national team's success and the women's World Cup broadcasts, have significantly improved the image and appeal of the sport for young girls. The growth of the professional women's league with top clubs like Paris Saint-Germain has also encouraged more girls to play.

- While enrollment statistics still show far fewer licensed girls than boys playing football in France, the young girls who do play are welcomed and respected at local clubs.

Read the full open letter from Marvin Gaye's children below: . An Open Letter from the Children of Marvin Gaye 3/18/15 . We want to extend our deepest appreciation and gratitude for the outpouring of love and support we have received from all of our father's fans and friends, as well as artists and industry folks who contacted us surrounding the recent events concerning his song, ""Got to Give It Up.""  Your kindness and encouragement gave us incredible strength and perseverance. We are so incredibly grateful for your support as well as the hard work and dedication of our amazing legal team and experts.  We thank you all. We especially want to thank our mom Jan for her belief in what we were doing all along, and for her never ending support. We will celebrate what would have been our dad's 76th birthday next month, and though we miss him every day -- just like the many thousands of well-wishers who have expressed their heartfelt goodwill - it is through his music that we find our compass and our paths moving forward.  We are his children, but we too are his fans and we hold his music dear. It is in that spirit and on behalf of all those who Dad always considered an extended family, his fans, we take this opportunity to set the record straight on a few misconceptions echoing through some news and social media platforms about our intentions, our plans, and the so-called 'larger' ramifications of this case within the music industry. Originally released in 1977, ""Got to Give It Up"" became one of our dad's most cherished hits, still a favorite at backyard barbecues, weddings, parties, on the radio, or on your iPod.  As Oprah said, it is one of her ""favorite party songs of all time."" The comments on social media, emails and calls we received after the verdict affirmed for us that the song continues to touch in even deeper ways, becoming part of the soundtrack to so many lives.  ""Got to Give It Up"" is also recognized by Billboard Magazine as the fourth biggest single of the 30 charting hits our dad created during his extraordinary career. It has been nearly 38 years since its initial release: tastes change, trends evolve, but we should all be able to agree that it's a testament to the enduring power of ""Got to Give It Up"" that we have arrived at this juncture with Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams, at all.  The fact that they have openly acknowledged their respect and admiration for the song is public knowledge, and further proof of its resonance with an entirely new generation of music fans. However, most songwriting begins with an organic approach; a songwriter brings his or her influences to the table and then works creatively from a blank slate in the crafting of their song to ensure originality and the integrity of their creation.  If Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams had tried to create a new song and coincidentally infused ""Got to Give It Up"" into their work, instead of deliberately undertaking to ""write a song with the same groove,"" we would probably be having a different conversation. Like most artists, they could have licensed and secured the song for appropriate usage; a simple procedure usually arranged in advance of the song's release.  This did not happen. We would have welcomed a conversation with them before the release of their work. This also did not happen. Instead of licensing our father's song and giving him the appropriate songwriter credit, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams released ""Blurred Lines"" and then filed a pre-emptive lawsuit against us, forcing us into court.  They sought to quickly affirm that their song was ""starkly different,"" than ""Got to Give It Up.""  The Judge denied their motion for Summary Judgement, and a jury was charged with determining the ""extrinsic and intrinsic similarities"" of the songs.  The jury has spoken. We wanted to also make clear that the jury was not permitted to listen to the actual sound recording of ""Got to Give It Up.""  Our dad's powerful vocal performance of his own song along with unique background sounds were eliminated from the trial, and the copyright infringement was based entirely on the similarity of the basic musical compositions, not on ""style,"" or ""feel,"" or ""era,"" or ""genre.""  His song is so iconic that its basic composition stood strong. We feel this further amplifies the soundness of the verdict. Like all music fans, we have an added appreciation for songs that touch us in mysterious ways.  Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams certainly have a right to be inspired by ""Got to Give It Up"" but as the jury ruled, they did not have the right to use it without permission as a blueprint for a track they were constructing. Great artists like our dad intentionally build their music to last, but we as the caretakers of such treasures, have an obligation to be vigilant about preserving the integrity of the music so that future generations understand its origins and feel its effect as the artist intended, and to assure that it retains its value. We feel as many do that, our father, Marvin Gaye, is an artist for the ages.  But whether we're talking about a work created 50 years ago or a work created 50 years from now -- protecting the legacy of original artistry is not a personal obligation, but a universal commitment in support of enduring creative achievement, encouraging future artists to also aim for new ground and their own legacies. That is what copyright laws help us do; they give people the incentive to write original songs and then help protect those songs. Our dad spent his life writing music- that is his legacy to us all- he wrote from his heart and was a brilliant songwriter, arranger, producer and one-of-a-kind vocalist.  If he were alive today, we feel he would embrace the technology available to artists and the diverse music choices and spaces accessible to fans who can stream a song at a moment's notice. But we also know he would be vigilant about safeguarding the artist's rights; a sacred devotion to not only the artist, but key in encouraging and supporting innovation. He also gave credit where credit is due. Howard King, the attorney for Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams stated after the verdict:  ""We owe it to songwriters around the world to make sure this verdict doesn't stand.  My clients know they wrote the song 'Blurred Lines' from their heart and souls and no other source."" We never for a minute suggested that Mr. Thicke and Mr. Williams' hearts weren't in it.  But a jury of eight men and women have ruled that the source for ""Blurred Lines"" was the song ""Got to Give It Up,"" a song our dad wrote from his heart, and delivered to the world with pure joy. With the digital age upon us, the threat of greater infringement looms for every artist.  It is our wish that our dad's legacy, and all great music, past, present, and future, be enjoyed and protected, with the knowledge that adhering to copyright standards assures our musical treasures will always be valued. And finally, we want to put to rest any rumors that we are contemplating claims against Pharrell Williams for his song, ""Happy.""  This is 100% false.  We have absolutely no claim whatsoever concerning ""Happy."" Love and Respect, . Nona, Frankie, and Marvin III .

The 23-year-old has not played since being forced off during Leicester’s Champions Cup tie against Ulster last October. The initial prognosis was that he would be sidelined for six to eight weeks, but that was soon exposed as wishful thinking. A series of target dates for his comeback have come and gone, and now it appears Tuilagi won’t resurface until the last month of the season — if at all. Manu Tuilagi has not featured since injuring his groin playing for Leicester back in October . The England centre is in a race against time to be fit for the World Cup, starting in September . Sportsmail understands he is setting his sights on playing four or five games for the Tigers in late April and May, but only time will tell if that ambition can be realised. England were already resigned to being without their midfield colossus for the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign, but having had Tuilagi in camp to oversee his rehabilitation, the management are aware that he is not close to being match-ready. The latest bulletin represented another setback in an alarmingly drawn-out recovery. ‘He is making good progress and is doing straight line running, but he still has some way to go,’ said head coach Stuart Lancaster ahead of another Calcutta Cup encounter which will not feature Tuilagi. ‘I think he’ll come good at the end of the season. Certainly Phil Pask (physio) has done a good job with him, but it’s not in the near future. By the end of the season he’ll be back playing. ‘It is about making sure his groin and the healing around it is strong enough to cope with the forces he puts through it. He is a powerful man and he needs to make sure the groin has healed sufficiently. It is a step-by-step process to make sure he does not re-injure it, so that is why people are very cautious.’ Leicester and England are keen to build their attacking game around Tuilagi’s forceful ball-carrying but the pattern in the last two years has been for longer spells injured than fit. He has made only four appearances for the Tigers this season, following a modest tally of 10 last season in a campaign disrupted by a prolonged recovery from a pectoral injury. Tuilagi is a destructive figure but when he breaks down it takes a long time for his powerful body to heal. In early December, his club’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, predicted an imminent return and outlined just what Leicester and England were missing. ‘Manu should be back by the end of December,’ he said at the time. ‘In the modern game you’ve got to be able to dent the line of the opposition — you need physicality and Manu gives you that. He has been huge for England. The midfield is the biggest problem England have and Manu gives you that one position solved.’ Tuilagi could make a return in the final month of the season but his World Cup place is in jeopardy . Tuilagi has struggled with injury over the past two seasons and has only played nine Tests since 2012 . Worryingly for Lancaster and his assistants, uncertainty over Tuilagi’s ability to withstand the rigours of his profession remains part of the problem. In 2012, he played 10 times for his country, culminating in a devastating contribution to the record win over the All Blacks at Twickenham. Since then he has made only nine Test appearances, four of them as a replacement and one of those for the Lions on a tour where his impact was undermined by yet another injury. Despite attempts to alleviate his condition using prolotherapy — involving injections of a sugar solution into the bone — it is thought that a recent improvement has been brought about by intensive physiotherapy. Leicester will hope his best-case scenario of a return for the business end of the season ignites their Aviva Premiership title challenge, while England will want Tuilagi to join their initial World Cup training squad in June, ready to play a full, active part. England head coach Stuart Lancaster confirmed Tuilagi is no closer to making a return . Lancaster oversees training as his side prepare to face Scotland in the Six Nations on Saturday . How England will line up against Scotland at Twickenham on Saturday . He remains the most potent weapon in the team’s back-line, when available. He can splinter the best defences and has even spooked the All Blacks with his explosive exploits in midfield. That continues to be the primary area of concern for Lancaster despite the advances made by Jonathan Joseph during this championship, to the extent that Henry Slade and Sam Burgess have been under close scrutiny in camp this week. That pair are seen as World Cup contenders. Billy Twelvetrees appears to be running out of chances to prove his Test credentials at 12, Luther Burrell is striving to claim that position and Kyle Eastmond appears to have been tried and discarded. Lancaster has said Tuilagi will be considered at inside centre, if that is the position to fill, while he was even shunted out to the wing in New Zealand last June. Whatever the number on his back, England will surely pick him, but by now they would ideally have spent ample time fine-tuning their centre combination. Instead, if Tuilagi is eventually cleared for a comeback, there will be a maximum of three pre- tournament friendlies to reintegrate him before the main event comes around.","Manu Tuilagi has not played since October after injuring groin for Leicester .

According to local news site DNAinfo, Jane Hsu, who is the principal at P.S. 116 in Kips Bay, Manhattan, sent a letter home to the parents of all Pre-K through fifth grade students informing them that the school's teachers would no longer be assigning work for the children to do outside of school hours. She suggested that her students' time would be better spent focusing on other, more enjoyable, activities such as playing video games, watching TV or spending time outside. Scroll down for video . Putting her foot down: P.S. 116 principal Jane Hsu (left), pictured with assistant principal Gary Shevell, has banned homework for pupils at her school . 'The topic of homework has received a lot of attention lately, and the negative effects of homework have been well established,' Ms Hsu explained to parents in the letter. 'They include: children's frustration and exhaustion, lack of time for other activities and family time and, sadly for many, loss of interest in learning.' Ms Hsu added that she was 'excited that we are redefining the landscape of homework', before going on to explain that she didn't believe she was 'eliminating' homework, but rather adjusting the expectations of both her parents and her pupils in terms of what that phrase means. But while her students are no doubt delighted at the news, their parents are less enthused by the school's decision. 'I was just thinking maybe I'll keep my daughter here for another year, but this pushed me over the edge,' Daniel Tasman, the father of a second grade pupil at the school, told DNAinfo. 'This is their time to learn now, when they have good memory,' said Stanley, the parent of a third grade pupil at P.S. 116. 'I give him extra work, though. I go to Barnes and Nobles and give him my own homework.' Ironically, the school's mission statement - which available on its website - states clearly that pupils are expected to 'achieve high academic standards' and to 'take responsibility for their own learning'. Homework-free zone: Parents of the school's students are angry at Ms Hsu's decision, with one father going as far as to say he would pull his daughter from her class . 'Our school, P.S. 116, is a community of learners in which all children are encouraged to achieve high academic standards and social success, to enjoy learning, to celebrate diversity, to develop analytical skills, and to model exemplary behavior,' the website explains. 'We empower our students to take responsibility for their own learning by recognizing that effort leads to academic success. 'They are active participants and every child has a responsibility not just to perform a task, but to do it to the best of her or his ability.' But despite the anger and frustration being voiced by many parents however, Ms Hsu is adamant that she has made the best decision possible for pupils and added that she is 'looking forward' to seeing what 'positive impact' the school's new homework options will have on both the students - and their parents. And according to Peter Pizzolongo, associate executive director at National Association for the Education of Young Children, Ms Hsu's theory is actually not as bizarre as some of the school parents might think. Speaking to Yahoo Parenting about P.S. 116's new homework policy, Mr Pizzolongo explained that, while children need 'the opportunity to apply what they have learned after they leave the school environment', that additional education time doesn't necessarily have to take the more traditional form of worksheets and book-based assignments. 'When kids engage in rough and tumble play outdoors, ""big body play"" we call it, they're not only enhancing their physical development, they're learning how to set limits in a social-emotional context, problem solve, and make decisions,' he added. 'These skills hit all the domains of learning.'","Jane Hsu, the principal of Manhattan-based P.S. 116, informed parents last month that children would no longer be assigned any homework .

Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving woman in the history of Congress, announced Monday that she will not run for re-election. 'Do I spend my time raising money, or do I spend my time raising hell?' the 78-year-old old Maryland Democrat, now in her fifth term, said she asked herself when deliberating whether to seek a sixth term next year. 'I don't want to spend my time campaigning for me. I want to campaign for the people,' she said at a news conference in the Fells Point neighborhood of Baltimore. 'Do I spend my time promising what I would do – or do it now and do it the way I like to?' Senate Appropriations Committee Ranking Democrat Barbara Mikulski, a Marylander shown in 2012, announced that her plans for the future don't include Congress . The diminutive Mikulski, seen standing on a box behind a Senate podium, castigated Republicans on Feb. 24 for refusing to pass a Homeland Security funding bill without a string attached that would de-fund the persident's executive actions on immigration . Mikulski, a tough, no-nonsense lawmaker who rose to the leadership of the powerful Appropriations Committee, became the longest-serving woman in the history of Congress in 2012. She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1976 and has served in the Senate since 1987. She said that when her term has ended, 'I will know that I will have given it my best shot.' Her retirement is certain to set off a race among potential candidates to succeed her, including Democratic Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards, and former Govs. Martin O'Malley, who is considering a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Republican Bob Ehrlich. She becomes the second Senate Democratic woman to announce her retirement this year, following Barbara Boxer of California. In a 2014 interview, Mikulski said her approach as chair of the Appropriations panel was 'to focus with civility and courtesy. Old school values. Don't do surprises or stunts and negotiate directly and not through the press.' In her state, she has been fiercely protective of the environment, especially Chesapeake Bay issues. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell described Mikulski at the time as forceful and results-oriented. 'I think she's terrific,' he said. Mikulski had been seen as more engaging and approachable than her predecessors as appropriations chairman, the late Sens. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Daniel Inouye, Hawaii, both Democrats. She had spent decades honing relationships with members of both parties, learning their needs and end goals. After a short tenure as chairman, she now is the top Democrat on the panel after Republicans captured control of the Senate in last November's elections. 'She knows that if you know somebody and what they want, you can help them be successful. And when you help people be successful, Republicans or Democrats, that's how you move bills,' said Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, a Mikulski protege. Mikulski has also been an active advocate of equal pay for women. The Maryland senator sponsored legislation last year aimed at tightening a 1963 law that made it illegal to pay women less than men for comparable jobs because of their gender. But Senate Republicans blocked the bill in an April 2014 floor showdown. 'When I hear all these phony reasons, some are mean and some are meaningless, I do get emotional,' Mikulski said of arguments against the legislation. 'I get angry. I get outraged. I get volcanic.' Mikulski played off former CIA Director Michael Hayden's recent comment that Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, was motivated by 'emotional feeling' when she sought an investigation of the spy agency's harsh treatment of terrorism suspects .","Mikulski is a Maryland native who bas been in Congress since 1976 and a senator since 1987 .
Democratic Reps. Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards, and former Govs. Martin O'Malley and Bob Ehrlich, could all run to replace her .
Mikulski's exit announcement came just weeks after a similar announcement from California Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer .","Here is a summary of the key points from the article:

- Senator Barbara Mikulski, the longest serving woman in Congress, announced she will not run for re-election after her current 5th term ends. At 78 years old, she said she wants to focus on doing her job rather than campaigning and fundraising for another term.

- Mikulski has been a tough, no-nonsense lawmaker who rose to become the powerful chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. She is known for working across the aisle, avoiding surprises, and negotiating directly rather than through the media. 

- Her retirement is expected to spark a race among potential Democratic and Republican candidates in Maryland to succeed her, including several current and former members of Congress and past governors. She is the second veteran Democratic senator, after Barbara Boxer, to announce retirement this year.",0.81,"Thoroughly analyze the given text to comprehend the key information, events, underlying motivations, and implications.

Lee, 22, was on Tuesday given a ’50-50’ chance of being ready for the ‘pool of death’ later this year because of a ruptured Achilles tendon, with his recovery already delayed by a week after specialists in London decided there is too much swelling to perform an immediate operation. It has left Wales painfully low on experience in the front-row – the four props in the matchday squad to face Italy have just 11 Test starts between them – but Gatland maintains the onus is on Jones, capped 100 times, to reverse his decision to hang up his international boots. Warren Gatland has told Adam Jones that he will not ‘get on his knees’ and beg the prop to play . Samson Lee injured his achilles during Wales' 23-16 win against Ireland in the Six Nations . ‘I was surprised at the timing of his announcement,’ said Gatland. ‘He wasn’t out of our thoughts: we had played a little bit of phone tag, leaving messages and going backwards and forwards. If he has changed his mind and wants to get on the phone and say “I made a rash decision, retired too early and want to be part of the World Cup squad,” that is a different conversation. Jones passes the ball during the British and Irish Lions training session held at Scotch College in 2013 . Wales captain Sam Warburton reacts with Jones during the Six Nations in 2013 . ‘At the moment I will not be going on bended knees ringing him saying “please come back, we really desperately need you”. For us, it’s about dealing with the other players. If Adam Jones wasn’t retired from international rugby, then he may very well be in the squad now.’ Making his Test debut in 2003, Jones became a household feature in the Welsh pack alongside fellow front-row Gethin Jenkins. While Jones will not feature on Saturday because of his retirement, Jenkins will play no part because of a hamstring injury. Asides from the changes up front, Gatland has stuck with the same starting XV that beat Ireland at the Millennium Stadium, with his side needing to overturn the points advantage of England and Ireland if they are going to snatch the championship. Prop Lee had to leave the field on a stretcher at the Millennium Stadium during Wales' win over Ireland . Lee was pictured on crutches with his foot in a protective boot after the match . If Wales do enjoy a landslide result at the Stadio Olimpico and pip their rivals to the title, they will find themselves in a position where there is no silverware to celebrate with. The two trophies are due to be sent elsewhere and - while there is understood to be disappointment behind the scenes - Gatland accepts that it is a logical decision. ‘We can understand from the points difference that they are taking one to Twickenham and one to Edinburgh,’ he said. ‘If we do get enough points and win, we will celebrate in our own way. Maybe we will get some medals to hang around our necks or maybe we will have to wait 24 hours; we’ll wait and see.‘ . Sergio Parisse limped off during Italy's defeat by France in Rome at the weekend . If Parisse plays he will be a major factor in Wales' attempts to win the Six Nations . After their early kick-off at the Stadio Olimpico, the tourists will move on to a black tie function at the Palazzo Venezia in central Rome. They will have to wait on tenterhooks, but any hopes of a thumping victory could hinge on the fitness of Italian skipper Sergio Parisse, who is struggling with a foot injury and is the heartbeat of the Azzurri team. ‘He’s a catalyst for them,’ said Gatland. ‘If they defend heavily in the front line with 14 or 15 men and we try to play too much rugby too early, they might get a chance of turnovers and penalties or intercepts. We have to negate two or three of their obvious strengths and put ourselves in a position to score some points.’ Warren Gatland knows his team need a large victory to overhaul England and Ireland . Wales beat Ireland 23-16 at the Millennium Stadium to force themselves into title contention . Wales have identified the final 20 minutes as the opportunity to rack up their points difference and Gatland has named a bench loaded with attacking intent. Gareth Davies has usurped Mike Phillips to provide scrum-half cover for Rhys Webb, who on Tuesday signed a dual contract, while Justin Tipuric and Scott Williams will also be expected to make a late impact. ‘If the championship comes down to points difference, that says to me there is not a lot of difference between the three of the four teams at the top,’ said Gatland. ‘We improve as a squad through campaigns and we have demonstrated that again in this competition. The exciting thing about the World Cup is the time we will have together to do in-depth coaching and stuff we do not have the opportunity to do in the Six Nations. The time we have together will make a massive difference.’ Gatland's Wales side have a plus-12 points difference, 25 behind England and 21 adrift of Ireland .","Samson Lee suffered a World Cup threatening injury in Cardiff .

- While acknowledging Jones' experience, Gatland insists he will not get ""on bended knees"" pleading for the prop's return, instead focusing on the current squad as Wales need a landslide win over Italy to overturn England and Ireland's points difference and snatch the Six Nations title.

- Gatland is wary of Italy's strengths, particularly if talisman Sergio Parisse is fit, and has targeted the final 20 minutes to rack up a decisive margin, naming an attacking bench to chase a big win that could leave Wales celebrating an unlikely title triumph.",0.8454545454545457,"Thoroughly analyze the given text to comprehend the key information, events, underlying motivations, and implications.

Before they were spotted, the women, 21 and 25, were able to carve a J and an N into a brick wall on the first floor of the west side of the Colosseum. After carving the eight-inch high letters, the women posed together for a selfie. The women, just two of six million tourists that flock to the Colosseum every year, used a coin to engrave the letters, La Stampa reported. They are said to have broken away from their tour group before - but other tourists saw what had happened and alerted security. Police charged the women with 'aggravated damage on building of historical and artistic interest', according to Republica. After they were caught, the women  apologized to Piazza Dante police and Captain Lorenzo Iacobone. They said: 'We apologize for what we did. We regret it but we did not imagine it was something so serious. 'We'll remember for a lifetime.' According to the Guardian, the section damaged dates back to the 1800s - a key period of restoration. A spokesman for the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome is quoted as saying: 'It’s not an original wall but it’s nevertheless antique.' With approximately six million visitors to the Colosseum each year and ever-increasing staff cuts, policing the site has become a major problem. Sadly many of the stones bear the unsightly engravings of tourists keen to leave their mark. The Californians’ lawbreaking comes little over three months after a Russian tourist was caught carving a 25cm letter into the Colosseum. The 42-year-old was given a four-month suspended prison sentence and a €20,000 fine, although owing to a lack of funds he has not paid the penalty. Two tourists from the United States were caught engraving their initials at the Colosseum in Rome, Italy . The women were charged with 'aggravated damage on a building of historical and artistic interest' on Saturday . He was said to be the fifth tourist seen defacing the Colosseum in 2014. A father and son from Australia and teenagers from Brazil and Canada were also caught out last year. Built in the first century CE, the Colosseum is a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site. In order to make the  UNESCO list, a site must have a special cultural or physical significance. The Colosseum, which is also called the Flavian Amphitheatre, was named after a colossal statue that once stood nearby. The structure 'accommodated games of great popular appeal, such as hunts and gladiatorial fights' until the end of the Ancient Age, according to the Special Superintendency for the Archaeological Heritage of Rome. The organization adds: 'The building was, and still is today, a show in itself. 'In fact, it is the largest amphitheatre not only in the city of Rome but in the world, able to offer stunning sceneries as well as services for spectators.'","The women, aged 21 and 25, broke away from their tour group on Saturday .

Home Minister Rajnath Singh told India's parliament on Wednesday the comments of Mukesh Singh, one of five men convicted over the 2012 attack in New Delhi, were 'highly derogatory and an affront to the dignity of women'. 'The government condemns it,' he said of the documentary made by award-winning British film-maker Leslee Udwin, who won rare access to New Delhi's Tihar jail to interview the prisoner on death row. Scroll down for video . Indian activists take part in a vigil to mark the second anniversary of the fatal gang-rape of a student in New Delhi . 'It will not allow any organisation to leverage such an incident and use it for commercial purpose,' he said of the film, which charts the aftermath of the fatal gang-rape. Singh's comments in the Rajya Sabha, India's upper house, came after a New Delhi court late Tuesday issued an order banning media from showing the film, 'India's Daughter'. The reasons for the court ban were not immediately clear, but some in India have expressed concern that a convicted rapist was being given a platform for his views. Spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the New Delhi police had petitioned the court for a ban on the grounds that the film's 'objectionable content' could cause public disorder. The physiotherapy student died from her injuries 13 days after she was savagely attacked on a bus while on her way home from the cinema. The incident  triggered violent protests in India. It highlighted the frightening level of violence against women in the world's second most populous country and led to a major reform of India's rape laws, speeding up trials and increasing penalties. India's NDTV network was due to have shown the documentary to mark International Women's Day on Sunday, when it will also be broadcast in six other countries including Britain. Udwin said she was heart-broken by the ban on the documentary, in which Mukesh Singh said the 23-year-old victim was to blame for her own death. He said: 'A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy. A decent girl won't roam around at 9 o'clock at night .... Housework and housekeeping is for girls, not roaming in discos and bars at night doing wrong things, wearing wrong clothes.' The woman and her friend were returning home from seeing a movie at an upscale mall when they were tricked by the men into getting on the bus, which they'd taken out for a joyride. The attackers beat her friend and took turns raping the woman. They penetrated her with a rod, leaving severe internal injuries that caused her death. Singh, who was driving the bus, added: 'She should just be silent and allow the rape.' Police officers escort Mukesh Singh, one of the men convicted of the gang-rape and murder of an Indian student, outside the High Court in New Delhi, on September 24, 2013 . 'I am sure, positive, that NDTV will fight this arbitrary censorship all the way, because it is an organisation that stands up for values, for public welfare and for the greater good,' she told AFP. 'India is a country that values its rights and one of the most important of them is the freedom of speech, expression and that needs to be upheld.' Udwin said earlier she had permission from both prison authorities and the home ministry to film inside the vast Tihar jail in Delhi for her documentary. But Home Minister Singh said she had violated the terms of the agreement by not showing the complete unedited footage to jail officials. The documentary divided lawmakers on Wednesday, with many applauding the ban but others saying India must confront views such as the rapist's - however abhorrent. 'Banning this movie is not the answer,' said Anu Agha, an independent MP. 'We have to confront the issue that men in India do not respect women and any time there is a rape, blame is put on the woman.' No one at the NDTV network could immediately be reached for comment on the ban. But Udwin said she believed the move would only serve to increase interest in her film. 'The more they try to stop the film, the more they are going to pique people's interest,' she said. 'Now, everyone is going to want to see it.' Four men including Mukesh were sentenced to death for the crime, but their execution was later stayed on appeal by India's Supreme Court. One of the defendants hanged himself in prison, while another, who was under 18 at the time, got three years in juvenile detention.

The Showtime series has dealt with terror cells and double agents across the world, but dramatizing ISIS and one its leaders Jihadi John is not on the agenda. Executive Producer Alex Gansa revealed that writers have been asked to steer clear of the subject matter as he cannot see any way of humanizing their vile actions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Steering clear: Homeland will avoid portraying the Islamic State or one of its murderous members Jihadi John because producers do not want to give the terror group a platform - despite documenting terror and torture . 'They are just too evil to dramatize on TV': Executive producer Alex Gansa (pictured, right, with lead actress Claire Danes) made the comments at a pop culture festival held annually at The Paley Center in Los Angeles . Gansa spoke at the opening night of Paley Fest in Los Angeles for on Friday night. He confirmed that the show will not be ending anytime soon and leading star Claire Danes insisted that she is committed long term too. Asked about whether ISIS plot lines would be considered, Alex replied: 'It's a very good question because Homeland for the last four seasons has tried to portray our adversaries and tried to humanize them. 'And if you look at Abu Nazir, even look at Brody, or look at Haqqani this past season there was a real effort to make their concerns and their lives understandable. 'That is very hard to do with ISIS. 'It's very difficult to do because what they are doing on the ground feels so medieval and so horrible that you give them a platform on television I'm a little wary of; to try to make what they are talking about understandable or relatable is very difficult. Gruesome: Homeland earned a reputation for pushing the envelope with episodes about terrorism and the CIA . ISIS has lured converts from around the world to join their murderous rampage across Iraq and Syria . 'So we are struggling with that. Maybe this is too soon, Maybe we don't understand them well enough; It may be that they are just too evil to dramatize on television.' Homeland has featured drama based on real life encounters that US intelligence services have dealt with across the world. However Gansa feels that even attempting to portay a character like Jihadi John would not work for his critically acclaimed TV series. 'I think to humanize or to create a sympathetic member of IS right now is a very tall order, that I would be nervous about doing; I really would; I think right now the intelligence communities, the United States government doesn't really even know how to deal with them on the ground right now. 'From what I understand Iran and Iraq are leading the charge against IS right now. in that part of the world, and the United States is loathed to put boots on the ground and; we want to stay in the air with these it strikes how effective is that going to be? We don't know. 'So it is a very interesting question and one that we wrestle with because one of the great things about Homeland is that we are able to comment on on current events in a way is a lot of shows aren't able to do.' Since 2010 Homeland has been a high hit around the world picking up honors for its writers and actors including Damien Lewis and Danes. While offers have flooded into the stars to go elsewhere Gansa feels the unique bond between the cast and crew has kept their show together. He also will delight fans by saying Homeland will only get better. 'I don't think we've been at the top yet I really don't. We were so fortunate to win the Emmy in the first year, but we are just getting started on that kind of thing. 'The great thing about Homeland is that if you look at every single season is very distinct; So we are not doing the same show over and over again. 'You will see season five is so radically different from season four. We are going to be two and a half years into the future from from season four, we going to be shooting the series in Europe, the show will be set in Germany this year, Carrie will be out of the intelligence agency is going to be a different show again and that is what is it fresh and that is what keeps it ask wanting to do it and we want to keep producing it as a higher level. Radically different: Season five (pictured) will be set in Europe with Carrie out of the intelligence agency . Reinventing: Gansa insists the show has the potential to change rather than sticking with Middle Eastern terror . Claire Danes announced she is staying on as the lead character, adding that it is her 'dream job' 'And once we stopped doing that then we will stop. We're here to stay for as long as we can make the show that we want to make and feel that it is at a certain level.' Speaking soon after, leading actress Claire Danes confirmed she was committed to the show long-term too. She laughed: 'I have to come back. I am contractually obligated.' Then turning serious, she added: 'It is a dream job and it is a dream company. 'I am never bored the writers are relentless in redesigning the show every season and she's naturally dynamic but they put her in such different circumstances and environments that she had different facets of her revealed and to me even. She remains vital and novel.' Claire said she was looking forward to working in Berlin for the next series. Paleyfest is an annual festival that salutes creative excellence and highly acclaimed TV programming, and offers a weeklong pop-culture experience that connects fans with the casts and creators of their favorite TV series. Paleyfest - sponsored by Citi - benefits the Paley Center's preservation and archival digitization efforts, and its ongoing mission to explore the significant impact of media on our culture and society.","Alex Gansa says he can't see any way to humanize Islamic State's action .

Five-year-old Seth Lane has one wish - for the world to wear his favourite colour, yellow. The brave youngster lives in a 'bubble' and can only dream of life outside the confines of his hospital room. He is bound to his bed by a rare immune disorder, which has made the outside, germ-infested world his enemy. Seth was born without an immune system and has lived in a sterile environment for more than half of his short life. Following an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant, his immune system turned on him once again. Since January the five-year-old has been forced to live in his hospital room. As he waits for a life-changing second bone marrow transplant Seth has made a heartbreaking video, watched by more than two million people, in which he appeals for people to show their support. Using speech boards the adorable youngster asks people to wear yellow on March 27, and post a picture on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram with the hashtag #WearyellowforSeth. Seth's parents, Leanne and Nik Lane, from Corby in Northamptonshire, said they have been astonished when the video went viral, with more than 2.5 million views in a matter of days. Hundreds of thousands of strangers have already pledged to wear yellow to show Seth they are thinking of him. The video features a smiling Seth perched on his bed holding up yellow cards asking for support. He said: 'Hello I'm Seth. I'm five-years-old and I love Fireman Sam, Paw Patrol and yellow. 'I'm in hospital, I was born with no immune system, and I need a second bone marrow transplant. 'On March 27 lots of people are going to wear yellow to show me how much support I have. Are you going to join in? 'Post a picture of you wearing yellow to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram with #wearyellowforseth.' Mrs Lane, a full-time mother-of-two, said: 'We never meant to start any sort of campaign, and only expected friends and family to join in. 'I can't believe it has taken off like this. It is overwhelming. Scroll down for video . The five-year-old was born without an immune system, leaving him vulnerable to picking up life-threatening infections. The condition, known as 'bubble disease' requires sufferers to live in a sterile 'bubble' 'I don't think there is a single country in the world that hasn't got someone who has got involved. 'It all helps show Seth that people are thinking of him. I told him about the views and he asked, ""Is it more than 20?' I said ""yes it is"" and he said ""wowee"".' Seth was admitted to hospital at the age of six months with an extreme chest infection. His parents were told he had severe combined immunodeficiency. Known as 'bubble boy disease' it is caused by a mutated gene and means the body's antibodies cannot respond to infections, leaving sufferers extremely vulnerable to germs. He was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he had a bone marrow transplant from donor umbilical cord cells. But he was kept in a 'bubble' - unable to interact with children, go to nursery or play outside in parks - for two years while his body got stronger. Mrs Lane, who has a five-month-old son Hugo with her husband, Nik, 31, said: 'He had no contact with other children until he was two-and-a-half. 'We would go out in the pram and I would have to put the rain cover over him with a little fan inside - people probably thought I was mad.' But after just a couple of years of normality - after Seth had started school and made his first best friends - his body turned on him in October. When he had his transplant as a baby he developed graft versus host disease - where his donated cells saw his own body cells as foreign and attacked them. A first bone marrow transplant failed, when his immune system turned on him. It means Seth is now confined to his hospital room once more, waiting for a second transplant . His father Nik Lane is set to be Seth's donor, and doctors are waiting until the five-year-old is well enough before performing the operation . Seth's parents recorded an adorable video of him holding up screen cards, appealing for people to wear his favourite colour, yellow, to show their support. It has so far been viewed by more than two million people . Initially, it only affected his skin - leaving him with painful red patches - but in October it turned on his own bone marrow, once again wiping out his entire immune system. Seth returned to his 'bubble' - an ultra-hygienic single room at Newcastle's Great North Children's Hospital - in a bid to keep him free from potentially lethal infections, in January. 'If I'm a bit run down and have a coldsore I can't touch him,' said Mrs Lane. 'And if we have a cold we can't go in at all. 'Everything has to be sterilised and his room has filtered air. The staff are scrupulous with cleaning. 'Nothing can leave the room once it has come in and been cleaned, his soft toys are washed at 60 degrees every couple of days and his bed sheets are boil washed every day. 'Nik is with him all the time so his clothes have to be washed at 60 every day and Seth has never been out the room.' His father - who will be a donor for Seth once he is well enough - recorded the video of Seth last week. In just six days it has attracted 2,483,855 views and hundreds of thousands of people have messaged Mrs Lane to say they are planning on wearing yellow. It is thought Seth will have his transplant in around six weeks, but will probably have to remain in near-isolation for around a year after the operation. 'It's hard for him, and he is getting bored, but he never complains and he understands,' said Mrs Lane. After his operation and around a year in a sterile environment, Seth's parents hope he will be able to play with his friends and little brother again .","Seth Lane, five, from Corby, was born without an immune system .

Those being evacuated are the last American troops stationed in the Arab nation, which is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terrorist group also known as AQAP. The United States closed its embassy in Sanaa last month, after Houthi rebels took over the Yemeni capital. And hundreds of al Qaeda members escaped two Yemeni prisons Thursday and Friday, raising further security questions. For years, the U.S. military has worked closely with Yemen's government to go after AQAP, together carrying out numerous attacks like the 2011 drone strike that killed prominent al Qaeda figure Anwar al-Awlaki. And U.S. President Barack Obama has hailed this cooperation as a pillar in his anti-terrorism campaign. ""Yemen has never been a perfect democracy or a island of stability,"" Obama said in January, promoting the policy of ""partnering and intelligence-sharing with that local government"" as the best approach in a bad situation. ""The alternative would be for us to play whack-a-mole every time there is a terrorist actor inside of any given country,"" the President said. But while there have been drone strikes as recently as last month, these cooperative efforts have been hampered by Yemen's growing difficulty in maintaining unity and peace. These include the rise of the Houthis, their battles with forces loyal to ousted President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and the presence of not only al Qaeda fighters but other militants. On Friday, for instance, ISIS purportedly claimed responsibility for bombings at two mosques in Sanaa what, if true, would mark that group's first large-scale attack in Yemen. The claim came in a statement posted on a site that previously carried ISIS proclamations, but couldn't be immediately authenticated by CNN. Those blasts killed at least 137 people and wounded 357 others, according to Yemen's state-run Saba news agency. While ISIS and al Qaeda are both Sunni groups that espouse extreme versions of Islam and violent opposition to the West, that doesn't mean they will be working together anytime soon. In fact, AQAP strongly rebuked ISIS in a video released in November, characterizing its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's declaration of an Islamic caliphate as illegitimate. More than anything, the idea of the group calling itself the Islamic State violently flexing its muscles speaks to the chaotic situation there. With no one really in control, that means numerous groups -- including those with a history of killing civilians and lashing out at the West -- have been more room to operate and a better chance potentially to take over. Meanwhile, the main players for control of Yemen's government -- those siding with Hadi, who still claims to be president after being deposed earlier this year, and the Houthis, a minority group that's strongest in the northern part of the country -- remain very much at odds. Just two days ago, a Yemeni jet commanded by the capital's Houthi conquerors fired missiles at a palace housing Hadi in the port city of Aden. No one was injured, but the direct strike nonetheless marked an escalation in the deadly fighting between the two sides. The airstrikes came on the same day opposing Yemeni military forces -- some under the Houthis, others led by officers loyal to Hadi -- battled in Aden, said Aden Gov. AbdulAziz Hobtour. At least 13 people died and 21 others were injured in those clashes, according to Hobtour. Hadi took to the airwaves of Adan TV, a station he recently started, on Saturday in his first televised speech since escaping house arrest. He called on all political factions to take part in upcoming talks in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, condemning the Aden strike and urging Yemeni troops to refuse orders from Houthi officials. Hadi tied the Houthis to Iran, which he was said supported the ""coup"" that led to his departure from Aden. ""The Iranian agenda of the Houthis will not last,"" he said. Needless to say, the Houthis aren't convinced. Mohammed Al Bukhaiti, a top member of the Houthi Political Council, said Hadi's speech won't help Yemen reach a peaceful resolution and accused him of reneging on a deal last September to transfer power. ""We blame Hadi for not implementing this deal that drew the road map that would have solved Yemen's ongoing crises,"" Al Bukhaiti said. ""Hadi will be held responsible for the country's failures and that chaos that could follow."" Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa, and CNN's Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.","Yemen's deposed president lashes out at Houthi rebels in a speech .

The summary should maintain coherence and flow while prioritizing factual correctness over strict length or formatting constraints.",8,"(CNN)In the past eight months, ISIS has seeded itself in some dozen countries around the globe. Indicative of this was the announcement on Saturday that the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram had pledged its ""allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims,"" ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. The global spread of ISIS raises key questions about whether these new affiliates signal an intensification of the threat of terror. It also has important implications for the debate in Congress over Obama's request for a new authorization to fight ISIS. Lt. Col. Michael Waltz, a U.S. Special Forces reserve officer who has just returned to the States after advising the Nigerian Ministry of Defence in its fight against Boko Haram, told me, ""So far the pledge (to ISIS) seems to be legit."" Waltz says there is some debate about the timing of the pledge, because Boko Haram has recently come under effective attacks by Nigerian forces allied with the armies of neighboring African countries that are also threatened by the group: ""Some folks in the region are saying it's a sign of desperation, as the regional offensive by Nigeria and its neighbors has knocked Boko Haram on its heels and out of a number of its sanctuaries. The Chadians have been particularly effective."" But Waltz also says there is some evidence that the Boko Haram pledge to ISIS ""has been in the works for some time."" The group's increasing alignment with ISIS is demonstrated by Boko Haram's recent beheadings of its victims and its more professionally edited video releases of recent weeks that have mimicked ISIS' slick videos. Virginia Comolli, whose book ""Boko Haram: Nigeria's Islamist Insurgency,"" will be published next month, agrees that the more sophisticated Boko Haram media releases of the past couple of months point to ""some sort of inspiration"" that Boko Haram is drawing from ISIS and that recent beheadings ""might also be a form of copycat but, I shall note, they are not completely new"" for Boko Haram. Comolli also emphasized to me, ""lately the government had been able to take back a number of towns under Boko Haram control. Boko Haram has always been very resilient and adaptable, changing and upping its game when needed. The pledge might be exactly that: Boko Haram has recently suffered some serious blows and feels it needs to try something different to strengthen its position."" Some 5,000 have died in Boko-related violence during the past half-decade, while more than 1.5 million have been forced out of their homes, but Boko has generally not attacked Western targets. Its affiliation with ISIS could change that although, for the moment, it's not clear how the Boko-ISIS alliance would work from an operational standpoint. Hilary Matfess, a researcher at the Nigeria Social Violence Project at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, told me, ""Boko Haram would be the largest group to pledge allegiance to ISIS, but it's not certain what kinds of logistical or operational support that ISIS could provide an African affiliate."" Since August, Boko Haram is one of some 30 terrorist groups that have issued statements of support for ISIS or have gone further and pledged their allegiance to ISIS, according to IntelCenter, a Virginia-based company that tracks terrorist organizations. Of most concern are the groups that have pledged allegiance to ISIS, since this allows ISIS some measure of command and control over these organizations and also means that these groups will likely more closely align with ISIS' goal of creating a caliphate across the Muslim world as soon as feasible and use the most reprehensible of tactics to do so. In addition to Boko Haram, terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines and Yemen have pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to IntelCenter. What could this mean for the wider jihadist terrorist movement? It's worth taking a closer look at how the Libyan branch of ISIS, which affiliated with it in November, has played out on the ground in Libya. A senior U.S. government official told me that there is some debate in the U.S. intelligence community about whether ISIS' Libyan affiliate is more of a ""wannabe"" ISIS, and a ""rebranding"" of a local group that wanted to take advantage of ISIS' fearsome brand, than a group that takes orders from ISIS central command in Syria and Iraq. On January 27, ISIS gunmen attacked the Corinthian Hotel in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, killing 10. Five of the victims were foreigners and one was an American. And last month ISIS released a video showing members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority being beheaded on a Libyan beach, apparently by members of ISIS' Libyan affiliate. The video showed the victims in the orange jumpsuits that ISIS forces its victims to wear. Both the attack on the Corinthian Hotel and the beheading of the Christians do suggest some measure of command and control by ISIS' core of its Libyan affiliate, according to the U.S. government official, who says Libyan fighters frequently go back and forth between Libya and Syria and Iraq. The increasing globalization of ISIS raises some interesting questions for the Obama administration and for Congress. Last month Obama put forward a proposal for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force specifically targeting ISIS. Obama's AUMF proposal mentions combating ISIS in its heartland of Syria and Iraq, but it doesn't mention the dozen other countries where ISIS now has a presence or foothold. Interventionist Republicans will likely want to see an AUMF that specifically targets other groups allied to ISIS that are outside of Syria and Iraq. Many Democrats will be uncomfortable about such an expansion. The ball is now in Congress' court to decide how geographically wide the scope of the fight against ISIS should be. It will be an interesting debate: on one side, those who want to prolong indefinitely what is already America's longest war, against jihadist terrorist groups like ISIS that have affiliates from Algeria to Afghanistan; and, on the other, those who want to circumscribe that war both in time and in space. Given the fact that a broadly written AUMF that was passed in the days after 9/11 has allowed the United States to conduct military operations in half a dozen Muslim countries over the course of the past 14 years, a new authorization that specifies both a sunset provision and also a specific geographic scope would be a useful check on executive power. And such an authorization could be amended if a substantial new threat from an ISIS affiliate emerges.","Bergen: Boko Haram is the latest of terrorist groups in 12 countries to pledge allegiance to ISIS .
He says the spread of ISIS poses questions for Obama, Congress in deciding future of fight against terrorism .","Sentence 1: ISIS has expanded its presence to around a dozen countries globally, as evidenced by the recent pledge of allegiance from the Nigerian terrorist group Boko Haram to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

In an interview with Billboard magazine, she said that finding out about the 23-year-old star's death encouraged her to leave the chorus behind and try out as a solo pop artist in New York. Touching on her career choice, the 45-year-old continued: 'It made me realize... Life is short, and you don't know what's going to happen. Go for your dreams and don't let anyone hold you back.' Selena - nicknamed the 'Mexican Madonna' for her provocative dress sense - was shot and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, the president of her fan club on March 31, 1995 in Corpus Christi, Texas.

She continued: 'That's why we're still talking about her 20 years later.... People like that don't come along every day. 'There is never going to be another Selena.' Just two years after playing Selena, Lopez successfully managed to convert herself from a film star to a pop star.

She went on to win a Best Mexican-American Album Grammy for Live, had several hits in the U.S. and was about to cross over to the English-language pop market when she was murdered weeks before her 24th birthday. Her posthumous album, Dreaming of You, which was mostly recorded in English, topped the Billboard 200 chart and stayed atop the Latin charts for nine months.

The two main Spanish-language TV networks in the U.S. will also air special Selena programming over the weekend. The late singer's father, A.B. Quintanilla, insists Selena's music has not dated, citing the hit 'Tecnocumbia.'

The Prime Minister lectured other Western leaders over the need to hit the target during last year’s Nato summit in Wales. Conservative MPs are plotting a rebellion against Prime Minister David Cameron next week when the Commons debate will call for the UK to honour its commitment to spend at least 2% of its income on defence . But Mr Cameron has refused to guarantee that the spending pledge will continue after the election, and – to the anger of many MPs – Tory sources say it will not feature in the party’s manifesto. Instead, the Prime Minister has said only that a future Tory government would protect the defence equipment budget and maintain troop numbers. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond was yesterday reported to have warned Tory MPs there are ‘no votes in defence’. Aides to Mr Hammond, a former defence secretary, said they ‘did not recognise the comments’, adding that the minister is a staunch supporter of defence spending. But former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the reported comments were symptomatic of the view of the party leadership. Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, said: ‘There is a view at the top of the government – I don’t think the Prime Minister shares it – that defence isn’t a vote winner. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (pictured) was reported to have warned Tory MPs there are ‘no votes in defence’ ‘But what they have to understand is that defence is part of the DNA of the Conservative Party. And that’s true even in constituencies which don’t have a garrison. ‘Conservative voters instinctively believe that defence of the realm is the first priority of government.’ ‘And if people around the country do not see that is the case they will ask themselves what is the Conservative Party for?’ ‘We are following through a Lib Dem promise to spend 0.7 per cent on aid but we won’t commit to defence spending. People are asking is this the right order of priorities?’ Rory Stewart, chairman of the Commons defence committee said: ‘The fundamental point is the world is unfortunately more dangerous now than it has been in the past 20 years at least. ‘That means major powers like Britain have to spend more on defence.’ Fellow Tory James Gray said it would be a major error for Britain to drop its guard at a time of increased Russian aggression and the growing threat from Islamic State. Mr Gray said: ‘The people of the UK want to see strong defence of the realm, and they see the attacks carried out by ISIS and the Russian Bear bombers over Brighton and they realise the world is an extremely dangerous place. And they want the government to step up and hold to the promise they made at the Nato Summit.’ Conservative MPs now plan to use a Commons debate next Thursday to force a vote on the issue. A senior Tory MP last night said there was a ‘determination’ to force a vote, despite pressure from Downing Street to avoid a damaging split in the run-up to the election. Although the vote will not be binding on Government policy, defeat would be embarrassing for the Tory leadership and increase the pressure on ministers to back the spending target. China is to boost its military budget by 10 per cent this year to £94billion, making it the world’s second-biggest spender on defence. Last year, it spent £85billion, compared with Britain’s £37.4billion – but that is still only around a third of what the US spends. Beijing is seeking to assert itself as a growing power and officials say the money is to modernise the People’s Liberation Army – the world’s largest standing military force. China's growing force: Only the US spends more on defence . The US fears that China considerably understates its actual defence spending. Beijing has recently taken a more assertive stance on territorial disputes with Japan and other neighbours, leading to a rise in regional tensions. In response, Japan and India have increased their military budgets.","David Cameron is facing a growing Tory mutiny over defence spending .

Scott Werner of Portland, Maine, said this winter has been 'a horror show' for lobster fishermen like himself. The ice has prevented him from getting his boat out to fish in recent weeks, and cut into his ability to make money in the already slow winter lobstering season, he said. 'I'm not going to risk it. I don't want to break anything,' Werner said. 'It's been brutal, but what are you going to do?' Scroll down for video . New lows: Portland Harbor in Maine is encountering more ice than ever thanks to the coldest February on record - several lobster boats were locked in the ice and ice breakers are needed to keep commerce flowing . Iced waterways are a problem in other Northeast locations, such as off of Boston, where a commuter ferry carrying more than 100 passengers got delayed by about 45 minutes when it was slowed down by the coastal ice pack on February 20. And in New York, where the Coast Guard is cutting ice on the Hudson River so barges carrying heating oil, gasoline and jet fuel can reach destinations. The thickest part is in the area of Germantown and Hudson, north of New York City. In some spots the ice is a foot-and-a-half thick, Coast Guard officials said. 'The barges traveling from New York City to Albany have the most difficult time transiting through that one area, so that's where the Coast Guard is devoting its effort to keep clean,' Coast Guard Lt. Ken Sauerbrunn said. Landlocked: Lobster fishing boats are locked in ice at Widgery Wharf in Portland, Maine . It was the coldest February on record in Portland according to National Weather Service records that go back to 1940. The frigid temperatures froze more than ten lobster fishing boats in ice off of Portland, said Bill Needelman, the city's waterfront coordinator. Fewer fishermen have been able to pursue key food fish such as haddock and pollock, which has cut into landings at the city's fish pier and lessened activity at the Portland Fish Exchange auction, he said. The ice also is causing damage to piers and could contribute to erosion, Needelman said. Freezing conditions: A lobsterman looks out at the icy waters while checking on the condition of his boat in Portland, Maine - Ice clings to pilings at the high-tide mark in the background . He said this year's ice likely will take a heavy toll on waterfront infrastructure in the city. 'It's a highly destructive force and we can anticipate that there will be a lot of maintenance needs and repair needs,' he said. The Coast Guard experienced an approximately two week period in February when it's ice-cutting tug, Shackle, was out cutting ice every day, Chief Warrant Officer Bob Albert said. Cutting was needed in Portland Harbor, the Fore River and parts of Casco Bay to allow for petroleum deliveries and for commuter ferries and fishing vessels to traverse the waterways, he said. 'The demand for ice breaking this year has exceeded any demands that have been placed on the Coast Guard at any time in the last ten years,' Albert said.","Scott Werner of Portland said this winter has been 'a horror show' for lobster fishermen like himself .

The Coast Guard experienced an approximately two week period in February when it's ice-cutting tug, Shackle, was out cutting ice every day .","Key Points:

- Thick ice over a foot deep in Northeast waterways is severely impacting those who work on the water, particularly lobster fishermen unable to access fishing grounds.

- The extreme ice conditions stem from the coldest February on record in areas like Portland, Maine, freezing boats in place and disrupting crucial commercial activities.  

- The U.S. Coast Guard has been actively cutting through the ice to allow movement of barges transporting heating oil, gasoline, and jet fuel, as well as facilitate ferry and fishing vessel passage.

Important Details:

- Lobsterman Scott Werner calls it a ""horror show,"" unable to fish for weeks and losing income during the slow winter season.

- A commuter ferry near Boston was delayed 45 minutes by coastal ice, and the Hudson River's thickest ice (1.5 feet) required clearing for barge traffic.

- Portland's waterfront coordinator warns of potential damage to piers and erosion from the destructive ice conditions this year.

Contextual Perspective: 

- The extreme icing represents the most severe demand for Coast Guard ice-breaking assistance in the region in over a decade.

- It highlights the vulnerability of critical maritime commerce and local economies to abnormal winter conditions impacting waterway accessibility.

- The situation underscores growing concerns over climate change implications for maritime infrastructure resilience in cold-weather environments.",0.85,"Thoroughly analyze the provided text to comprehend the key information, events, underlying motivations, and broader implications.

The U.S. Army says it will soon be sending armored Stryker vehicles on a 1,100-mile convoy through six European countries to show solidarity to allies in the wake of recent Russian actions in the Ukraine and Crimea that have Eastern Europe on edge. The move was first reported Thursday in the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. U.S. Army Europe posted the Stripes story on its website on Friday. The convoy is ""a highly visible demonstration of U.S, commitment to its NATO allies and demonstrating NATO's ability to move military forces freely across allied borders in close cooperation,"" U.S. Army Europe spokesman Lt. Col. Craig Childs, said in a statement, according to the Stripes report. The troops and vehicles involved will be moving from training exercises conducted as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve in Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, the report said. They'll move through Latvia and the Czech Republic as they make their way to Vilseck, Germany, about a 40 miles drive from the Czech border. The troops involved are from the 3rd Squadron, 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which are based at Rose Barracks in Vilseck, and they will be accompanied by the Army's 12th Combat Aviation Brigade, which will provide aerial reconnaissance, the Stripes report said. The move is unusual because long-distance movement of heavy military vehicles such as the 18-ton Strykers is usually done by rail. The trek is being called a ""Dragoon Ride,"" after the unit's nickname, the Dragoons. Troops will camp out along the route. ""For those participating in it, Dragoon Ride is a unique opportunity,"" Stripes quoted Childs as saying. ""Soldiers and their leaders will have numerous opportunities to engage with local communities along the route, deepen their appreciation for the cultural diversity within the alliance and enhance the relationships that are essential to building and maintaining mutual admiration, respect and trust among allied militaries."" The convoy will be the latest in a series of displays the U.S. and its NATO allies have taken under Operation Atlantic Resolve, during which the U.S. ""is demonstrating its continued commitment to collective security through a series of actions designed to reassure NATO allies and partners of America's dedication to enduring peace and stability in the region, in light of the Russian intervention in Ukraine,"" according to the Defense Department's website. The displays have come as close to 300 yards from the Russian border as U.S. Army Strykers participated in an independence day celebration in Nava, Estonia, last month. Other recent actions include the Air Force's movement of 12 A-10 Thunderbolt ""tankbuster"" attack jets to an air base in Germany and this month the placing of hundreds of tanks and military vehicles in Latvia, where they'll soon be matched up with 3,000 troops from Fort Stewart, Georgia. Tension with Russia extends to the air too. Adm. William Gortney, commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that ""this past year has marked a notable increase in Russian military assertiveness."" Russian heavy bomber aircraft flew more patrols outside Russian airspace ""than in any year since the Cold War,"" though he did not offer a specific number. There have also been increased Russian air patrols across the coastlines of Europe.","Armored U.S. Army Strykers to make trek to display solidarity with U.S. allies .

Sun Guofang, 28, beat odds of 100,000-to-one to be a match for Li Fangdong, 33, after he suffered kidney failure shortly after they were married. The couple, who dated for two years before getting wed in 2009, booked in for the life-changing operation on February 14. Devoted: Wife Sun Guofang (left) and husband Li Fangdong before transplant surgery to give him one of her healthy kidneys in Shandong, China . They were checked into the hospital in China's Shandong province where the surgery was successfully carried out this week, People's Daily Online reports. Li and his dad had both initially been against Sun getting tested as they thought she was too young to give up a kidney. So Sun got tested in secret before convincing them to let her do it for the sake of the couple's four-year-old son. She said: 'I actually got the results back saying that we were a match on Valentine's Day, which meant it was the perfect moment to make the offer to my husband and I was glad when he finally accepted. 'I am told I can get by fine with one kidney anyway and I have a healthy diet so I don't expect it to be any real problem.' Ultimate gift: Sun Guofang is wheeled into the operating theatre as she donates one of her kidneys to her husband . In need: Li Fangdong is taken into surgery to receive one of his wife's kidneys they hope will end years of pain . The couple from Liangwang village, near the eastern city of Jinan, are expected to remain in hospital for another five days before they are allowed home. Sun had worked as a sales manager in a local toy company until her mother-in-law was diagnosed with kidney failure in 2009. She was forced to leave her job so she could be closer to where her husband's mother was being treated. Li's mother died two years later. 'I quit my job after my mother-in-law got sick. I sold egg pancakes on the street in the day then went back to work in the shop,' said Sun. Initially, Sun was embarrassed to sell food on the streets so would cover her face with a dust mask. But then her husband became ill and needed dialysis three times a week which cost £64 a session. Worried: Li Fangdong looks anxious before his life-saving surgery while Sun's mother (right) waits nervously outside her room . Recovering: Sun Guofang gives the thumbs up sign after successful surgery to remove her kidney . She said: 'At the time, we owed other people 200,000-300,000 yuan (£32,000). 'I never thought it was a difficult situation, as long as my husband and I strive together, everything will get better.' Now the pair are recovering in hospital and Sun says she is ready for life to start going back to normal. She said: 'I have a bit of a fever but other than that I feel fine, and am looking forward to going home.' Li, who also has a heart problem and lung infection, said that the couple had already started making plans for their new life together. 'It meant a lot to me when she said she was going to spend her life with me,' he said. 'Once the stitches been removed we plan to do a bit of travelling together to catch up on lost time.'","Surprised everyone as chances of her being a match were 100,000 to 1 .

- The devoted couple have a 4-year-old son together, and Sun made the sacrifice after years of financial hardship paying for Li's dialysis treatments which cost around $10,000 per year after Li's mother also died from kidney failure. Sun had to quit her job to help care for her mother-in-law before Li became ill.

Students at The Grange School, in Runcorn, Cheshire, were kept out of lessons today after they refused to remove yellow ribbons and daffodils supporting the Marie Curie cancer charity. Head Barry Carney defended the decision, saying the school selected one charity to support each year and couldn't be seen to prefer one cause over another, but parents branded it 'pathetic'. Student Lily Gaynor, 16, said that up to 70 students from The Grange School, Cheshire, had been taken out of lessons ahead of their GCSEs for refusing to remove the charity pins . Pupil Lily Gaynor alerted a local newspaper to the student's plight by calling them from isolation. She estimated that between 60 and 70 students had been removed from classes. The 16-year-old said: 'We have been taken out of lessons before our GCSEs because we won’t take off our charity badges. 'We’ve got cancer badges and ribbons on our blazers and they’re saying it isn’t part of school uniform and it’s singling out some charities over others. 'We’ve been here about an hour. They’re planning on keeping us here all day. It jeopardises our learning and we’ve got exams soon.' Corinne Versleys, whose daughter Caitlin Mulchrane is among those in isolation, said: 'The school is putting children in the isolation unit for wearing those flowers. 'I think it’s absolutely ridiculous - all it is is a little flower. 'The majority of kids wearing them are dealing with family members with cancer and they’re being told to remove them. I think it’s absolutely pathetic.' The Marie Curie daffodil appeal has been running every March since 1986. Supporters are encouraged to donate in return for a daffodil badge or ribbon which they can wear. Support: Pupils were wearing these flowers and yellow ribbons given out by the Marie Curie cancer charity during March as part of a fundraising drive which last year raised £8.26million . Last year the campaign, which is supported by the likes of actors Olivia Coleman and Dominic West, helped to raise £8.26 million, funding 413,000 hours of nursing care. Despite criticism, Barry Carney, the head of Grange School, said he was simply applying the school's uniform policy, which was available online 'for all to see'. He told the Liverpool Echo: 'Each year we have a nominated charity which we call the head boy and the head girl’s charity. This year it happens to be the Teenage Cancer Trust. 'A number of students have been wearing some badges which are not permitted according to the rules of the school, which are pretty clear. 'When we asked students to remove these badges there has been a small number who have dragged their heels and said because of personal circumstances they want to show their support.' He said he has spoken to these pupils and suggested organising a fundraising event to support the charity, rather than wearing a ribbon or badge. He added that the school holds plenty of charity events, and has raised £1,000 for the Teenage Cancer Charity in the past year, with an open door cafe planned next Thursday. He said the school was contemplating having more than one nominated charity next year.","Pupils had ribbons and daffodils supporting Marie Curie cancer charity .

Take combustible issues like religion and sexuality, stir in a new law and talk of a boycott, then -- boom! -- the debate on social media explodes. And so it has proved with Indiana's new ""religious freedom"" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. Supporters of the bill say it protects their right to believe as they choose. Opponents say it is nothing but bigotry dressed up as liberty. The debate is nothing if not vitriolic. And colorful, too. ""Libs SHUTUP,"" reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's ""Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)"" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. People on the other side of the debate are equally emphatic -- and, it seems for the moment, more numerous. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. Others say that Indiana seems out of step with modern times. And then there is the business reaction -- both the nascent boycott from outside the state and the rush by some businesses inside the state to declare that, law or no law, they have no intention of turning anyone away. ""My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct,"" tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce. ""We stand against discrimination."" And a tweet from a the St. Elmo Steak House, a business in Indianapolis, the state's capital and its largest city, pledged in capital letters to continue serving ALL. The word Freedom should only be used when it's inclusive and fair for all. Supporters of the law, however, made it clear what they thought opponents should do with their proposed boycott. ""Before you go and get too self-righteous w/ your #BoycottIndiana,"" a user called Caleb Parke tweeted, ""@GovPenceIN is protecting #religiousfreedom for EVERYONE! #EqualRights.""","Social media supporters of Indiana's ""religious freedom"" bill say it protects their right to hold their own beliefs.
Opponents of the bill say its ""freedom"" is a cover for bigotry against gays and lesbians.
Some Indiana businesses tweet that they will continue to serve all customers, regardless of orientation.
Some users take to social media in attempt to organize boycott of Indiana .","Here are the essential points summarized from the article:

- Indiana recently passed a ""religious freedom"" law that could allow businesses to refuse service to gay and lesbian customers based on the owners' religious beliefs. This has sparked intense debate and backlash on social media.

- Supporters argue the law protects religious freedom and the right to follow one's beliefs, while critics condemn it as legalized discrimination and bigotry against the LGBTQ community. 

- The controversy has led to calls for boycotts against Indiana from outside the state, as well as some businesses within Indiana publicly affirming they will not discriminate against any customers despite the new law.",0.8714285714285713,"Thoroughly analyze the provided text to comprehend the key information, events, underlying motivations, and broader implications.

The cold case review focuses on backpack murderer Ivan Milat, who was convicted of seven murder, along with Bandali Debs, Ashley Coulston, and Reginald Arthurell and other known mass murderers. Dozens of unsolved deaths are being re-opened and examined for links to the men by a review team from the NSW Unsolved Homicide Squad, a move which Inspector John Lehmann said was motivated by a desire for justice. The cold case review focuses on backpack murderer Ivan Milat, who was convicted of seven murders . 'Even though some of the murders are old, sometimes 30 years ago, and the killers are locked away it doesn't mean we should give up,' Inspector Lehmann told The Daily Telegraph. 'It's about getting justice for the dead and for their families.' The Unsolved Homicide Squad is currently investigating more than 600 unsolved murders which date back to 1965. While official links between any of the known killers and their potential victims are yet to be made, Inspector Lehmann said he was hopeful that the task force would be able to build up enough evidence to charge the murderers. Inspector Lehmann said that while the review was 'routine', the approach was different, and made all the more unusual as a result of the reputation of the killers. Ivan Milat is considered by many to be Australia's most notorious serial killer, responsible for the murders of seven backpackers whose bodies were discovered in the Bengalo State Forest in NSW. Milat is currently serving seven consecutive life sentences for the murders, including those of British backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters, who were discovered in September 1992 after being reported missing in April.

Their bodies were discovered in the Bengalo State Forest in NSW in 1992 . British backpackers Caroline Clarke (above, left) and Joanne Walters, who were discovered in September 1992 after being reported missing in April . Clarke has been shot ten times in the head and Walters had been stabbed 35 times, and the bodies of his other victims, most of whom were foreign backpackers, also died of stab or gunshot wounds. Bandali Michael Debs is currently serving four consecutive life sentences for the murder of teenager Kristy Harty in 1997, prostitute Donna Ann Hicks in 1995, and police officers Sgt Gary Silk and Sen-Constable Rod Miller in 1998. The judge presiding over the case called the murder of the teenager as 'entirely senseless, needless and wanton.' 'This was, most clearly, a callous, craven and senseless murder in cold blood of an entirely innocent, defenceless and vulnerable young woman. The evidence leads to the inevitable conclusion that you murdered Kristy Harty for no other reason than for the sheer sake of it.' 'You are an evil, violent and dangerous man, who places no value on the life of another,' Justice Kaye said of the killings of Sgt Silk and Sen-Constable Miller. Ashley Coulston (left) is currently serving three consecutive sentences, and Reginald Arthurell (right) is a suspect in the unsolved murder of 82-year-old Catherine Mary Page . Bandali Michael Debs is currently serving four consecutive life sentences for the murder of a teenager, a prostitute, and two police officers . Bandali Debs was charged with the murder of prostitute Donna Ann Hicks (above) in 1995 . Debs is currently in the Goulburn Supermax Jail, along with fellow inmate Milat, who is suspected of killing more people than he is convicted of. Ashley Coulston is currently serving three consecutive sentences for the 1992 murders pf housemates Kerryn Hestridge, 22, Anne Smerdon, 22, and Peter Dempsey, 27. In July of 1992, Coulston responded to an ad placed by the housemates for a new tenant, and shot them in the back of the head execution style while they were hogtied in separate rooms of the house. Coulston is also a suspect in the Balaclava Killer case, where Queensland victims were raped and killed over a ten month time frame between 1979 and 1980. Reginald Arthurell is a suspect in the unsolved murder of 82-year-old Catherine Mary Page, has pleaded guilty to manslaughter for the stabbing death of sailor Ross Browning, his ex-step father Thomas Thornton, and was found guilty of the murder of his fiancee Venet Raylee Mulhall. 'The team will look at what we have in ways of linking these murderers to a victim and then hopefully build up enough evidence to form a strike team and eventually charge them,' Inspector Lehmann told The Daily Telegraph.

Part of a Southampton team boasting Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and Adam Lallana, and managed by Mauricio Pochettino, Davis let in three against Chelsea that day in January 2014. Yet on Saturday, like a blast from the past, the 38-year-old goalkeeper became the fourth oldest player to feature this season. He did so with gusto, earning a round of applause from his team-mates as he entered the dressing room afterwards. 38-year-old veteran goalkeeper Kelvin Davis put in a confident display against Burnley on Saturday . Davis had come on as a substitute after first-choice Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster was injured . Davis' assured performance earned him plenty of praise from his team-mates as Southampton won 2-0 . Southampton striker Shane Long scores his side's opening goal against Burnley at St Mary's on Saturday . Long runs to celebrate in front of the home fans as Southampton take the lead against Burnley . Southampton have benefited from more opposition own goals than any other Premier League team this season (5). His appearance came in unfortunate circumstances. An injury to Fraser Forster's left knee that will almost certainly rule the goalkeeper out of England's internationals this month called for Davis to wipe the dust off his gloves. There is no reason to panic as far as Koeman is concerned. He has a man he deems reliable and professional enough, both behind the scenes as club captain and on the pitch, to fill the void. Koeman was 51 on Saturday and, while Shane Long and an own goal from Burnley's Jason Shackell provided the victory, the Southampton manager's birthday gift was in no short part down to the man 13 years his junior. 'I was not surprised because we see Kelvin working every day in the training session,' Koeman said. 'That's important to have somebody when he has to play that he has some confidence. That he will not be nervous. 'His situation is clear. Fraser is first and Kelvin is the second goalkeeper. You need a lot of experience when you need to play and you have to show it. 'That's difficult but he showed his quality. He was looking very comfortable and that gave confidence to the rest of the team. He's not the youngest goalkeeper but still he's a very good goalkeeper. He's a very good professional.' Burnley's Jason Shackell (left) is put under pressure by Southampton forward Graziano Pelle on Saturday . Davis still has some way to go before catching Leicester City's 42-year-old reserve goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer but he made the most appearances for Southampton in League One four seasons ago, having joined the Saints in 2006, and rolled back the years on Saturday. Davis denied Sam Vokes and Danny Ings with full-length saves, and gave Koeman hope that losing Forster will not hamper the club that have conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League this season. Burnley tested them, but European football remains a possibility. Koeman was not oblivious to his former club Barcelona's win in the Champions League against Manchester City last week, yet he refuses to imagine himself taking Southampton to the Nou Camp. 'We don't think too much about the Champions League. We hope seventh place on the table means European football, and that will be fantastic for us,' said Koeman. 'The Champions League is amazing to play in and amazing to be involved in. We know our situation, we know our qualities. If it's Europa League, that will be great for us.'

One guy got hit with a bottle, one guy fell to the ground and got kicked in the face.' One of the men struck during the brawl was knocked unconscious with his eye 'swollen up to the size of a grapefruit,' according to Decarlis. 'People were trying to see if he had a pulse,' he added.

Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of capital murder in the 2013 deaths of Kyle and Chad Littlefield at a rural shooting range, after jurors rejected his insanity defense. Prosecutors hadn't sought the death penalty, so Routh was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Routh's attorneys said after the February 24 verdict they would appeal. Appeal: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is filing to appeal his capital murder charge after he was sentenced to life in jail . Killed: Routh fatally shot Chris Kyle, left, and Chad Littlefield, right, with multiple bullets in an attack in 2013 . J. Warren St. John, one of Routh's attorneys, said the notice of appeal was filed on Tuesday. St. John also filed a motion for a new trial, arguing the conviction and sentence were contrary to law and evidence. The case drew extra attention due to the film based on Kyle's memoir. Routh, 27, was emotionless as the jury read their verdict on Tuesday night: that he had not been insane when he opened fire on Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February 2013. They had taken him to a shooting range to help him settle back into society after he left the Marines. After the verdict, Littlefield's brother-in-law, Jerry Richardson, turned to Routh and said: 'You took the lives of two heroes, men that tried to be a friend to you. You became an American disgrace.' As the Littlefield family also spoke out on the Today show on Wednesday morning, jurors stepped forward to say they had 'no doubt' that Routh knew what he was doing at the time of the murders. Heartbroken: The strain showed on Taya's face ahead of the guilty verdict on Tuesday evening . Families: Deby Kyle, Chris Kyle's mother (right) is seen leaving the courtroom after the verdict, alongside Judy and Don Littlefield (left), whose son Chris was killed at the same time . The verdict came as interest in Kyle's career as the U.S. military's deadliest-ever sniper reached fever pitch thanks to Oscar-nominated film about his life, 'American Sniper'. Ahead of the trial, Routh's lawyers had argued that the popularity of the movie, which grossed $300 million at the box office, would mean he could not get a fair trial. And speaking on Good Morning America on Wednesday, the jurors admitted some of them had seen the movie - but insisted they had put that out of their minds when making their decision. 'It gave me a better outlook on Chris' role as a Marine,' one of the jurors, Barrett Hutchinson, said. 'But as far as the actions that took place on February 2, Chad was still in the picture and Chad was not in that movie. 'I took the fact that Chris was a marine out of my mind and looked at him as a person, looked at Chad as a person, looked at Eddie as a person and, you know, tried to make reasonable judgment.' An attorney representing Chris Kyle's wife is arguing that a judge was mistaken in awarding a $1.8 million defamation verdict to former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura over the way he was portrayed in the book American Sniper. In a brief filed Wednesday in the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Taya Kyle's lawyer wrote that the verdict should be reversed and the court should rule in Kyle's favor. At minimum, attorney John Borger wrote, Kyle should be granted a new trial. Ventura, a former pro wrestler and former Minnesota governor, sued Chris Kyle for defamation in 2012 after the best-selling author wrote in his book that he decked Ventura at a California bar because the former governor made offensive comments about SEALs. Ventura testified that he never made the statements and that the confrontation never happened. A federal jury sided with Ventura last summer, awarding him $500,000 for damages and recommending $1.3 million for 'unjust enrichment,' or how much money Kyle improperly made from the claim. U.S. District Judge Richard Kyle granted the unjust enrichment, finding it was 'reasonable and supported by a preponderance of the evidence.' But Borger argued on appeal that the unjust enrichment award based on alleged defamatory speech is unprecedented and violates the First Amendment. Borger also argued that Ventura didn't prove the account was either 'material falsity' or 'actual malice,' and as a result, he didn't meet the legal threshold for a defamation claim. Borger said the judge also erred in giving instructions to the jury. 'A properly instructed jury would not have rendered a verdict in Ventura's favor,' Borger wrote. Kyle, a former SEAL regarded as the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history, was killed in 2013 at a Texas shooting range. A former Marine was convicted in his death last month. Loved: Taya Kyle, pictured with her husband Chris, paid tribute to him in an emotional Facebook post on Wednesday morning, just hours after a Texas jury found his killer guilty of murder . Caught: Routh is pictured in the back of a police car after he fled the scene of the murder in Kyle's truck before he was eventually caught. He claimed he shot the two men because he feared they would kill him . Confession: Routh, pictured hours after the killings, confessed to the shootings almost immediately . Also on Wednesday, Chad Littlefield's family spoke out about the verdict. 'It was an answered prayer,' Judy Littlefield told the Today show. 'We've waited a long time to hear that. We feel justice has been served.' Routh's brother-in-law added that he never once believed Routh had been insane. Routh's attorneys had tried to prove he was in a psychotic state at the time of the killings. 'It was all an act,' Jerry Richardson said. 'I taught him in high school and... that's just the way he was. He never grew up. He was still just opposite defiant, and he had nothing wrong in the mind except for the drug use.' Chad's father Don remembered his son as a 'quiet man' and 'a good listener' who met Kyle at their children's soccer practices. The two men shared an interest in working out and helping veterans, Don said. Chad himself was not a veteran but wanted to help others. 'Chris served overseas and Chad served when they came back,' Mrs Littlefield explained. Mr Littlefield added: 'His motto was pass it forward.' Kyle's widow, Taya Kyle, testified in the trial but has not spoken out since the verdict. She was seen in the courtroom on Tuesday but did not return when the decision was read.","Eddie Ray Routh, 27, was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday for shooting dead 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield .
He has filed to appeal the capital murder charge and called for a re-trial .

James Robertson was recently able to move out of his Detroit neighborhood to a suburb with the more than $360,000 in donations he received in a crowdfunding campaign that started out as a means to purchase the 56-year-old a car. But apparently his ex-girlfriend and former landlady wants a cut of his new wealth. Scroll down for video . James Robertson used to walk eight hours to work every day, but now has a car, new home, and some money for retirement thanks to a kind crowd-funding campaign. Pictured above on March 4, cleaning his car . Robertson's ex-girlfriend and former landlady reportedly has been harassing Robertson for a cut of his money.

In this Tuesday March 3, 2015 photo, James Robertson, left, shows Charlie Purtan Levenson, 13, how to properly swing a baseball bat while he was visiting Robertson with his mother and others at Robertson's new apartmen . The Detroit Free-Press reports that Robertson has had to take out a restraining order against ex Tanya Fox, 60, who claims he owes her money. 'He said he was going to give me $50,000 to fix up the house,' Fox told the Free-Press, adding: 'James was not a neat person; he got grease all over the wall' in the apartment he rented from her for 15 years. Fox is just one of many in Robertson's old neighborhood who he has completely cut ties with. 'I may have been born there, but God knows I don't belong there anymore,' Robertson said about his old neighborhood near Detroit's New Center area. The plastic-molding operator also said he didn't tell people in his old neighborhood where he was moving. The 56-year-old gained celebrity after the newspaper reported earlier this year that he began walking to a job at an auto parts factory when his car stopped working in 2005 and bus service was cut back. Robertson pictured above hitting the pavement on his old 21-mile walk to work . A local college student launched a modest crowdfunding campaign to a buy a new car. It led to $360,000 eventually being raised and Robertson receiving a new, $35,000 Ford Taurus from an auto dealership. He still works at the same factory in Rochester Hills which pays him $10.55 an hour, but the hours-long walking trip now is done in a 20-minute drive. 'I'm going to keep working — that's for sure,' he told the newspaper. Financial experts are donating their service to help Robertson manage his money. The 1-bedroom apartment in Troy costs him $800 a month in rent. He had been paying $880 per month for less space in his ex-girlfriend's home in Detroit. Most of his money now is in a trust that has a principal amount of $351,000. The earnings from the trust should be enough to keep Robertson's nest egg untouched until he retires, said Rebecca Sorensen, a UBS Financial Services senior vice president for wealth management. She is part of the financial team helping him. People have stepped up because Robertson is unselfish and deserving, Sorensen said. 'He wants the majority of the funds he received to be invested in a way that will someday provide an income stream when he retires,' she added.","James Robertson, 56, used to walk eight hours to get to his $10.55/hour job .

Then along came the most unlikely of rescuers - a gigantic bull rhino who had been attracted by the creature's desperate struggles and mewling cries. It was the work of a moment for the enormous animal to hoist the foal out of the mud and to safety. But tragically this was one rescue that did not have a happy ending. Oblivious to its own strength, the rhino ended up impaling the zebra on its horn. Scroll down for video . Stuck in the mud: A bull rhino spots a zebra foal stuck in mud near a watering hole at the Madikwe Game Reserve and decides to start prodding the hapless youngster with his horn . Up you come: After a few seconds prodding the foal, the bull decides to hook it with his horn and yank it from the sticky morass - a move which seems to have come too quickly for the weakened youngster . Brutal: Although now free, the foal is almost sent flying by the bull rhino's sudden movement . Tragic: The young zebra slumps heavily down onto the rhino's horn. It is not clear whether this is the point that the foal was disembowelled by the bull's clumsy rescue . Roel van Muiden, a field guide and wildlife photographer, spotted the foal stuck in a deep and pitiless patch of mud while he was showing visitors around the Madikwe Game Reserve in South Africa. Nearby a bull rhino was chasing some females, then being chased away in return, but the foal's mother and her herd were nowhere to be seen. 'The foal must have been there for quite some time,' wrote Mr van Muiden in Africa Geographic. The bull rhino, he went on, finally gave up on his futile advances. Wandering down to the water, he found the hapless foal. Curious, the huge beast began prodding the youngster with his horn. After a while the bull, growing impatient with his toy, sank his snout deep into the mire before quickly lifting the foal from the mud. This was no altruistic rescue mission, having helped it escape the morass he merely dropped the animal and wandered off. But then he came back to the exhausted youngster for another look. Apparently wanting to see the foal from another angle, he used his horn to move it into a different position, and disembowelled it. Dropping it again, the bull flopped to the mud himself for a roll-around, almost crushing the dying baby zebra. The stricken animal didn't last much longer. Boredom: The bull rhino had earlier got nowhere with his advances towards a couple of nearby cows . Mr van Muisen said many things went through his mind as he watched the tragedy unfold, but his foremost thought was to 'let nature be nature'. 'I have had many comments from people seeing the photos asking why I did not retrieve the foal from the mud,' he said. 'The zebra’s herd was gone so even if I could have, he would not have survived as his mother and harem were nowhere to be seen and thus he would have died from starvation.' Mr van Muisen added that the foal's mother probably knew her child was caught in a hopeless situation. She probably had good reason for abandoning it to its fate, he said. Despite the foal's sad and early end, he said he felt lucky to see what he described as 'an amazing interaction between two species.' 'I have been guiding for almost ten years and may go on for many and still never witness something as amazing and melancholy as this.'","South African Roel van Muiden saw the incident at Madike Game Reserve .

But the visit was delayed because Republican leaders had invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address Congress during the same time period. According to two Afghan government officials involved in the planning for the visit, the Afghan government believed American media attention would be largely focused on Netanyahu, so the first U.S. visit of the new Afghan president was delayed by two weeks, which is a useful reminder that there is a sound reason why congressional leaders shouldn't unilaterally extend invitations to foreign leaders. Ghani and Abdullah arrived in Washington on Sunday and have had much to discuss with the Obama administration. For the Afghan government, the timetable of President Barack Obama's proposed troop withdrawal is the key issue. Obama says that the last American troops will leave Afghanistan at the end of 2016. This happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down America's post-9/11 wars. Ghani is clearly uncomfortable with the pace of this U.S. troop withdrawal, telling CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in January, ""deadlines should not be dogmas"" and that there should be a ""willingness to reexamine"" the withdrawal date. Is Obama's withdrawal plan a wise policy? Short answer: Of course not. One only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in Iraq after the withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an Afghanistan without some kind of residual American presence. Without American forces in the country, there is a strong possibility Afghanistan could host a reinvigorated Taliban allied to a reinvigorated al Qaeda, not to mention ISIS, which is gaining a foothold in the region. Needless to say, this would be a disaster for Afghanistan. But it would also be quite damaging to U.S. interests to have some kind of resurgent al Qaeda in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks. It would also be disastrous for the Democratic Party, should it win the presidency in 2016, to be the party that ""lost"" Afghanistan. After all, the Democratic Party is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the Republicans and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual American presence in Afghanistan, al Qaeda would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the Afghan-Pakistan border region against American interests somewhere in the world. On Tuesday, President Obama announced that the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan would be slowed and the remaining 9,800 troops would stay there through the end of 2015. But this welcome development does not change the central issue, which is the Obama administration's withdrawal date of December 2016 for all U.S. forces. Merely because the Obama administration will be almost out the door at the end of 2016 doesn't mean that suddenly at the same time that the Taliban will lay down their arms, nor that the Afghan army will be able to fight the Taliban completely unaided. Nor does it mean that al Qaeda -- and ISIS, which is beginning to establish small cells in Afghanistan -- would cease to be a threat. An easy way for potential Democratic presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton to distinguish their national security policies from Obama's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an Iraq-style outcome. Similarly, as the Republican Party starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign, potential candidates such as Jeb Bush can distinguish themselves from the isolationist Rand Paul wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long-term presence in Afghanistan. This U.S. military presence in Afghanistan doesn't have to be a large, nor does it need to play a combat role, but U.S. troops should remain in Afghanistan to advise the Afghan army and provide intelligence support. Such a long-term commitment of several thousand American troops is exactly the kind of force that the Obama administration was forced to deploy to Iraq following ISIS's lightning advances there over the past year. Selling a longer-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be pushing against an open door with that nation's government. Consider that within 24 hours of being installed, the new Afghan government led by Ghani and Abdullah signed the basing agreement that allows American troops to stay in Afghanistan until December 2016. Consider also that the Afghan government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the United States lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term U.S. military presence. Consider also that many Afghans see a relatively small, but long-term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability. It is also not in Pakistan's interests for Afghanistan to fall to the Taliban or be thrust into another civil war. The Pakistanis have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the Taliban to flourish on their own soil, most recently in the Taliban attack in December on the army school in Peshawar that killed 132 children. It is in Pakistan's own interest that the Afghan army is able to fight effectively against the Taliban, which is more likely if they continue to have American advisers at their side. Other regional powers such as the Chinese worry about Chinese Uighur separatists establishing themselves on Afghan soil. The Russians are similarly worried about Islamist terrorist groups located in Afghanistan and so will not stand in the way of a small long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country. Keeping a relatively small, predominantly U.S. Special Forces, presence in Afghanistan to continue to train the Afghan army past December 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both Afghans and Americans. Both the Democratic and Republican parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign. And Obama should do his successor a favor by leaving this important decision up to the next President.","President Obama is planning withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by end of 2016 .
Peter Bergen: The move would invite the kind of chaos we've seen in Iraq .","Here is a multi-sentence summary of the key points from the article:

- The Afghan president's first official U.S. visit was delayed due to conflicting timing with an Israeli prime minister's congressional address. This highlights issues with unilateral congressional invitations to foreign leaders. 

- A major concern for the Afghan government is President Obama's plan to fully withdraw U.S. troops by the end of 2016, coinciding with his term's end. President Ghani wants flexibility on the withdrawal timeline.

- The article argues that removing all U.S. forces could lead to a Taliban/al-Qaeda resurgence and endanger Afghan stability, damaging U.S. interests after heavy investment there. 

- While Obama announced slowing troop withdrawal through 2015, the central issue remains the full pullout by end of 2016 under his plan.

- The author suggests a longer-term U.S. military presence advising Afghan forces would prevent an ""Iraq-style"" security vacuum and be supported by Afghanistan's government and regional powers like Pakistan.

- This residual force could be small and avoid combat roles, focusing on intelligence/training - precisely the approach the U.S. had to re-adopt for Iraq after ISIS gains.

- The article recommends presidential candidates in 2016 elections distinguish themselves by supporting an enduring advisory presence in Afghanistan beyond 2016.",0.8800000000000001,"Thoroughly analyze the given text to extract key information, underlying motivations, and broader implications.

They are diverse and they're unique, just like everyone else in the world. Ella's series, ""First and foremost I am,"" consists of 21 portraits of people ranging from 9 months to 60 years old. She chose the number 21 to represent chromosome 21, the location of the most common genetic mutation causing the condition. It is currently on exhibit at the Reykjavík Museum of Photography and will be featured in May at the Warsaw Festival of Art Photography. Ella shot the photos in 2013 and 2014 as part of a final project at The School of Photography in Reykjavik. She recently shared the images with CNN iReport. The inspiration started with a radio interview Ella heard in which people were discussing ethical questions brought up by prenatal tests to detect birth defects. She hopes her photos shine a light on ""the beauty and diversity of mankind"" and make us wonder if a future without that diversity is desirable. ""I am not against prenatal/genetic testing for abnormalities but I think we need to stop and think what's next. ... It's necessary to open the discussion and educate people more about Down syndrome. It's not a disease or a flaw. Parents of children with Down syndrome ... wouldn't exchange them for anything in the world."" The title of the series, ""First and foremost I am,"" comes from a newspaper article by Halldora Jonsdottir, a 30-year-old woman who is also featured in Ella's project. ""I have Down syndrome but FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM Halldora,"" Jonsdottir writes. ""I do a million things that other people do. My life is meaningful and good because I choose to be positive and see the good things in life. I go to work, attend school and have hobbies."" Jonsdottir goes on to say, ""Who is perfect? Who can say, that we who have Down syndrome are worth less that anyone else? We are all different and would it be so great if we were all alike?"" Ella staged the portraits against a floral background because she wanted the subjects ""to stand out but also underline that all kinds of flowers can grow and flourish together."" The photo shoots lasted from one to three hours. She said she didn't give any coaching or direction for how they should pose; she just talked with them and waited for the right moment to shoot.

Salt Lake City pediatrician John Brickman Wall, 51, was convicted of killing Uta von Schwedler in September 2011 amid a bitter custody dispute. He faces up to life in prison. The case was highly contentious, with prosecutors alleging Wall had murdered his wife while defense attorneys claimed von Schwedler killed herself. Their son, Pelle Wall, said that though his father told him and his three siblings that their mother had killed herself, he didn't believe it. Scroll down for video . Pelle Wall, 21, publicly believed his Salt Lake City pediatrician father, John Wall, was guilty of murdering his mother, Uta von Schwedler in 2011 . After spending his entire inheritance from his mother on a campaign to convict his father, Pelle wants a confession. 'As I thought about... my dad's behavior before and after her death, it became more and more apparent to me that - that he was responsible for killing her,' Pelle told CBS's 48 Hours. Prosecutors alleged Wall attacked 49-year-old Uta von Schwedler with a knife, dosed her with an anti-anxiety drug Xanax and drowned her in her bathtub. Defense attorneys countered that the theory was unbelievable, and it was more likely von Schwedler killed herself. Her death initially was treated as a suicide. But family and friends pushed for more investigation, saying the researcher showed no signs of wanting to end her life. Pelle told CBS that he feared for his and his sibling's lives, worrying that they might be living with a murder. 'Part of the reason I was concerned for my safety as well as my sibling's safety - was that I saw this anger that he had towards my mother,' Pelle said. 'It didn't die with her. It jumped and it expanded.' The couple's oldest son, Pelle Wall (left) had testified at the trial claiming that his father was acting bizarre after the family learned von Schwedler had died. John Wall (right) was found guilty of murdering his ex-wife in March . Uta Von Schwedler's body was found in an overflowing bathtub in September 2011 and her death was initially ruled a suicide but further investigation led to the conviction of her ex-husband John Brickman Wall . Salt Lake City officials made no effort to remove the children from Wall's home and the investigation was put on hold. On the day before his 18th birthday in January 2012, Pelle moved out of his father's house into the home of his best friend, Jessica Oglesby, and was welcomed by her parents with open arms. But he had left his siblings behind. 'I realized that my presence there was not protecting my siblings,' he told CBS, adding that his father was upset that he had moved out. 'And once I had that realization and I moved out, then I could take active steps to protect them.' Pelle then fought for custody of his siblings and eventually won. The children were all moved into homes of family friends. His father sued him for a number of family scrapbooks that had been treasured items within the family. One of the books had been found next to von Schwedler's body. Pelle countered his father's lawsuit with a wrongful death suit, holding his father responsible in the death of his mother. Wall was eventually arrested and put on trial for the murder of von Schwedler. The evidence in the case was unusual: A medical examiner thought the shallow cuts on von Schwedler's wrists and leg looked like she was defending herself from an attack, but he couldn't explain the fatal level of Xanax in her system. Forensic experts had very different interpretations of the scene. Pelle Wall (left) spent his entire inheritance from his mother (right) campaigning for his father's conviction. He said now he wants a confession from his father . For the prosecution, spilled antihistamine pills on the floor, a house in disarray and bloodstains in von Schwedler's bed showed she was attacked. The defense said the home revealed signs of a troubled woman who died trying to calm herself with medication. 'The state just can't throw up a whole bunch of theories,' John Wall's lawyer Fred Metos said during closing arguments Thursday. He added self-injury is a rare side effect of Xanax. Prosecutors said von Schwedler studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease. She had no prescription for Xanax, but John Wall filled a large one for his mother months before his ex-wife's death. 'He resented her efforts to see the children, to talk with the children, to text the children, to email the children,' prosecutor Nick D'Alesandro said during closings. 'He just couldn't stop talking about how much he hated her.' The night of their mother's death, the former couple's four children were staying at John Wall's house. The next morning, he wasn't at home when they woke up. Instead, he went to a car wash and had the interior of his car cleaned, including a pinkish stain, according to prosecutors. Von Schwedler was a Cancer researcher who studied childhood leukemia and recently made a discovery that could help find new treatments for the disease . He came to work with a scratch on his face and injury to his eye; he said the family dog scratched him while he slept. Police knocked on John Wall's door that night, hours after von Schwedler's boyfriend found her body. During an intense interrogation, John Wall denied having anything to do with her death. The couple's oldest daughter, 19-year-old Malkie Wall, testified that her father returned home deeply troubled and asking his children if he was a monster. His lawyers said he broke down after police made him question his sanity, but there's no proof he was in von Schwedler's house. The jury of three women and five men deliberated for about seven hours before reaching a guilty verdict. After the verdict was read, the Pelle thanked police for years of investigation and 'uncommon persistence. He spoke at the courthouse in Salt Lake City surrounded by more than two dozen supporters. 'We have spent the last three and half years seeking justice for my mother, and today that quest is finally at an end,' he said. The victim's sister, Almut von Schwedler, said the Wall children will never be the same, but the verdict is the first step toward closure. 'Johnny never succeeded to destroy Uta's joy for life, but he ended up taking her life,' she said. John Wall, pictured last year awaiting his trial, faces up to life in prison for the murder of his ex-wife. A sentencing hearing will take place in July . John Brickman Wall, center, listens to blood pattern expert Rod Englert testify for the prosecution with his defense team Jeremy Delicino, left, and Fred Metos in February . 'Revenge was certainly not what drove us in those dark days, and dark and desperate days we had many of,' she added. Prosecutor Matthew Janzen said Pelle Wall played an important part in the case, one of many pieces that formed the largely circumstantial case. As the verdict was read, John Wall sat with his hands folded and shoulders bent, staring down and blinking rapidly as his frown deepened. The defendant's sister, Wendy Wall, maintained her brother's innocence. 'This verdict will not bring Uta back,' she said in a statement. 'Now, to that tragedy has been added the conviction of an innocent man.' Though Pelle has no regrets in fighting for his father's conviction, Wendy Wall is disappointed with what Pelle has done to his father. 'I think that Johnny felt devastated when, you know, when Pelle - in some ways you could say turned on him, I suppose,' she said. 'Everybody in our family Johnny included still very much loves Pelle, and I think that we're all trying to remember that… he's gone through incredible trauma.' Wall will be sentenced on July 8. Pelle said that he expects he will speak to his father 'once he's in prison'. 'I mean, I think I can ask him the questions. But, I don't expect that he'll answer. He'll just, you know, shake his head... and, basically, maintain the victim stance that he's always maintained,' he said.","Pelle Wall spent his inheritance from his mother on a campaign to get his father, John Brickman Wall, convicted .

Now a new gadget will allow homeowners to flip their lights on and off using their mobile phone, without having to change all their current light fittings and switches. Engineers have developed a device that attaches on top of traditional light switches to enable them to be turned on and off from anywhere in the home. Scroll down for video . Switchmate fits over existing light switches meaning it can be used in most homes without needing rewiring . The developers say the device, called Switchmate, means households can benefit from smart lighting without the need for expensive rewiring. Switchmate can be controlled using a mobile phone app over Bluetooth and uses a physical toggle inside the device to move the light switch. Imagine walking into your living room after a stressful day at work, to find the lights automatically dim themselves to suit your mood. It might sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but this is already possible, thanks to a gadget called Muse. The device, which went on sale in the UK this week, is designed to track people’s brain waves, in the same way that fitness trackers count the number of steps a person has taken, or monitor their heart rate. Users wear a plastic headband across their forehead, with sensors at the front and above the ears, to track their brain activity. This information is then beamed via Bluetooth to the user’s mobile phone or computer, where it is ‘translated’ into an image of a summer’s day in the country. People who have lots on their mind will see clouds rolling across the screen, whilst those who manage to empty their thoughts will be met by a clear blue sky. The product, developed by Ariel Garten, a Canadian neuroscientist and former fashion designer, launched in North America last year, and is designed to help people relax. It can also be linked to lighting and heating systems, in order to change the feel of a room depending on the user’s mood. According to Daniel Peng, co-founder of California-based Switchmate, the device works like a robotic finger for the lights in your home. The app can be used to set timers so the lights come on at prearranged times or proximity so lights turn on when you walk into a room with your phone. Mr Peng said: 'Switchmate allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone, but you can still press the button on the Switchmate face plate to manually flip the switch. 'A lot of our users set timers to make their homes look occupied when they are away, great for making your home safer when you are on vacation. 'You can also have the proximity setting on such that as you approach your home, your lights will turn on automatically for you.' Many smart lighting solutions either require switches to be rewired but recently some manufacturers have developed smart bulbs that can connect to mobile phones. However, these take the light switch out of the loop entirely, meaning lights need to be left in the 'on' position all the time for the bulb to work. Switchmate attaches to the outside of the light switch using magnets and has a button on its face allowing lights to be turned on and off as usual. This means that should their mobile phone run out of batteries or they are unable to connect to the device, they can still turn their lights on and off. The developers, who raised $139,000 in a successful funding crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, are also now working on a version that connects to the internet. The battery powered Switchmate uses a physical toggle inside the device to flip traditional wall mounted light switches (shown above) - working like a robotic finger than can be controlled using a mobile phone app . This means residents can turn their lights on and often while even while they are abroad on holiday. Switchmate is apparently compatible with two types of light switch - traditional flat 'rocker' switches and toggle switches. The developers say the device is also thin enough to be used on switches on multiple switch face plates and the battery will last between eight to twelve months. The team behind Switchmate are currently taking pre-orders with a single unit costing $49 (£32). However, at that price, it means kitting out the average home is unlikely to be cheap. The device is currently only available in the US and Canada, but Mr Peng said they hoped to have it available in other countries soon. It also cannot currently be used to control lights that use dimmer switches. Switchmate can be used with two different switch types - toggle switches (left) and rocker switches (right) The developers say Switchmate will be available in three different colours - gold, silver and white (all above) The device (shown above) can still be used like a traditional light switch by pressing the button in the middle . Mr Peng said they are hoping to develop new features in the coming months. He said: 'We designed Switchmate to make your lights smart in seconds - it snaps onto your existing light switch with magnets, connects to your phone, and allows you to automate your lights just like that. 'Because it just snaps over your light switch anyone can do it, and you can take it with you when you move in the future. 'Switchmate allows you to remotely control your lights via your smart phone, but you can still press the button on the Switchmate face plate to manually flip the switch.'","Switchmate is fixed onto existing light switches using a magnetic fastener .

- The battery-powered device attaches magnetically and has a button to manually operate the switch as well, ensuring functionality without a phone. Funded via crowdsourcing, Switchmate costs around $49 per unit, potentially making whole-home installation pricey.

- While convenient for retrofitting smart lighting, Switchmate represents an intermediate solution before more integrated smart home systems.

Qurban Hussain lied to the British High Commission in Islamabad about the child’s true parentage after his poverty-stricken Kashmiri parents begged his wife to adopt the boy. The life peer, who is Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s diversity adviser, now faces being investigated by police under the 1971 Immigration Act. But the 58-year-old, from Luton, insists that although it was legally wrong ‘morally it was the right thing to do’. Lord Hussain, pictured with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, realises what he did was 'legally wrong' but insists it was the 'morally right'. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party is looking into the matter . The Sunday Mirror revealed Lord Hussain told officials the boy, who was born in Pakistan in 1990, had the right to British citizenship as he was the father. The boy, now 23, was flown to the UK at the age of two – and given a British passport soon after. ‘I know now it is illegal. I realise it was legally wrong but morally it was the right thing to do,’ he told the Mirror. Lord Hussain explained he and his wife had ‘adopted’ the child to save him from a life of poverty, but had never filed the correct paperwork. Lord Qurban Hussain admits he illegally brought the boy to the UK by telling officials he was the father . He said: ‘The child’s mother begged my wife to take him. You have never seen levels of poverty like this family lived in.’ He added his ‘son’ is a university graduate and he and his wife are ‘very proud’. But the father-of-four, who has been outspoken of the dangers of illegal immigration, admitted that he didn’t realise it would come back to haunt him and his action were ‘a shame’ on him. Despite calls to resign from Labour MP John Mann, he has reportedly vowed not to quit his peerage as his ‘conscience was clear’. Lord Hussain has informed Lib Dem officials of the actions, but believes his actions were right. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said the party are investigating the matter. He said: ‘The party is aware of this and looking into it.’ Rules dictate that peers can be suspended or disciplined, but cannot be excluded from the House of Lords unless they have a conviction for an offence that carries a jail sentence of a year or more. Lord Hussain became a prominent figure in the Lib Dems after Mr Clegg approached him to represent the party in the Upper House. He was made a life peer in January 2011. His first act in Parliament was to discuss immigration and the risks of breaching immigration law. The Deputy Prime Minister recently vowed to remain tough on immigration after dramatically admitting he was wrong to offer amnesty to illegal immigrants in 2013. Lord Qurban Hussain was made a life peer in 2011 . Born in Kashmir, Qurban Hussain came to live in England in 1971 as a teenager. After moving to Luton in 1993, he joined the Trade Union Movement and served as a secretary for Luton TUC from 1994 until 1996. He was a member of the Labour Party from 1996, but joined the Liberal Democrats on March 20, 2003 - the day the war in Iraq began and campaigned against the conflict. He was subsequently elected a Lib Dem councillor on Luton Borough Council. As a member of the council's executive, he held the portfolios of citizenship, community, youth and leisure services as well as Equalities and Social Inclusion from 2003 to 2007. He was the deputy leader of the Luton Borough Council from 2005 to 2007. Lord Hussain was unsuccessful as a Parliamentary candidate for Luton South in 2005 and 2010, although he doubled the Liberal Democrat Party vote when he stood in 2005. After being awarded his peerage in 2011, he said: 'I now see this appointment as an opportunity to represent Luton in a major national forum. 'An opportunity to promote Luton’s cause and to work for resources to advance Luton’s regeneration and to enhance education, employment, training and life chances for young people in our town.' Source: Liberal Democrats . He ditched the party’s policy of allowing foreigners to ‘earn’ British citizenship by living in the UK for a decade without being caught by the authorities – claiming it risked ‘undermining public confidence’ in the entire immigration system. Last month, he blasted the Conservatives for failing to deliver on their promise of slashing migration figures. He said: ‘What we need to do and get on with - something I've been getting on with during my time in government - is, for instance, re-establishing the proper border controls at our borders so that we not only count people in, but we count people out.’ MailOnline has contacted Lord Hussain for comment.","Qurban Hussain admits he lied to British High Commission in Islamabad .

Nick Gardner from Perth ensemble San Cisco was on a friend's farm taking some time out last week to hunt pests when the unfortunate incident occurred.

The bass player in Perth band San Cisco has ruled himself out of the first leg of the band's upcoming tour after he literally shot himself in the foot . 'As we were driving through an exceptionally rough paddock, I reached down to stop the gun from bouncing around and before I knew it, it had gone off,' Gardner said. 'The bolt had slid down and the jolting had triggered the gun. Somewhat of a freak accident. I realised I had been shot and ripped off my boot and sock to reveal a hole in my foot and blood everywhere.

Arsenal and Chelsea both crashed out of the competition on away goals in the first knockout stage, beaten by Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain respectively. Wenger, however, has long championed a change to the rule. Arsenal crashed out of the Champions League on away goals despite beating Monaco on Tuesday . Monaco scored three away goals at the Emirates which proved to be the difference in the tie . If at the end of two-legged tie the score is level, the team that has scored the most goals away from home is declared the winner. For example, Monaco beat Arsenal 3-1 away from home before losing 2-0 in Monte Carlo. With the score tied at 3-3, Monaco progressed courtesy of having scored on more goal on their travels. 'That's a rule that's outdated now and should be changed,' the Arsenal boss said. 'It should count maybe after extra-time. It was created in the 1960s to get teams to attack away from home. 'Since then football has changed and the weight of the away goals is too big today. Maybe count it after extra-time like in the League Cup in England. 'I think the quality of Premier League is high and physical demands are extreme but I'm not in the mood to analyse too much what's wrong with English football. I don't think there's a lot wrong.' Wenger must pick up his players ahead of Saturday's game at Newcastle as the battle for a top-four finish in the Premier League continues. He added: 'The mood is down and we are disappointed. The tie lasted 180 minutes and we were not cautious enough in the first 90. We know why we went out, it's down to a dreadful defensive performance in the first leg. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants the away-goals rule changed in European competition . Manchester City were the third English club to be knocked out at the last-16 stage after they lost to Barcelona . 'We must focus on next targets and we have to continue to improve. We are better today than four months ago. 'Let's keep that attitude. There's a fantastic spirit and great quality. Let's rectify what we didn't do well in first game and continue to improve. 'We've won 13 of the last 15 and that's down to quality and improvement. We are not in a transfer period. Ninety-five per cent of the players will still be here next season and what is important is their attitude and improvement. We are in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, and in a strong fight in the Premier League. We can do that straight away on Saturday. 'We're on a good run. We won the game in Monaco. We're frustrated and disappointed to go out but that's down to our home performance especially on the defensive front. We were a bit unlucky as well.

Research shows that men aren't hugely attracted to witty women. Given the choice of a female who makes him laugh, or one that laughs at his jokes, he will choose the latter. Luckily, women aren't too worried about their jokes being appreciated. They, it seems, like men who make them smile. Men prefer it if a woman laughs at their jokes, rather than witty women research suggests (stock image) It is thought that women see the ability to make people laugh sign of intelligence – and men have evolved to show off how good they are with words. The University of Miami researchers quizzed more than 80 men and women about how much importance they placed on having a partner who could make them laugh. They were also asked how much it mattered to them whether their partner found them funny. The answers revealed that women like men make them laugh, while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour. In a second experiment, the volunteers were given hypothetical amounts of money to 'spend' on designing their ideal partner. They were asked how much of the cash they'd be willing to spend on getting someone who made them laugh and how much they'd devote to getting someone who laughed at their jokes. As the amount of 'money' on offer rose, the sexes became less rigid in their choices, with the males starting to splash the cash on funny females the women showing more interest in males who found them witty. The answers revealed that women like men make them laugh, while men want to go out with women who appreciate their humour (stock image) Researcher Liana Hone said this suggests that in an ideal world, we value both traits in a partner. However, in the real world, we tend to place more emphasis on one or the other. She believes that women see the ability to make people laugh as a sign of intelligence – and of the sort of high quality genes that she'd want in her children. Given that women tend to be more choosy, men are under pressure to make them laugh. Miss Hone, who is close to completing her PhD, said: 'Given that humour requires high-level linguistic capacity, women are thought to use humour production as a sign that a man is a mentally-capable suitor.' However, she said that funny women shouldn't despair. There is also hope for bachelors who never remember punch lines. This is because her results were based on averages – and not everyone will have the same taste.","Men prefer a woman to like their jokes rather than make them laugh .

University of Miami researchers quizzed more than 80 men and women .","The article discusses research findings on the differing preferences between men and women when it comes to humor and attractiveness in potential partners. The key points can be summarized as follows:

- Women generally find men who can make them laugh as more attractive, valuing humor production as a sign of intelligence and desirable genetic traits.
- In contrast, men are more attracted to women who appreciate and laugh at their jokes, rather than women who try to be funny themselves.
- This divergence is thought to stem from evolutionary pressures, where men aim to exhibit verbal intelligence and capability to prospective mates.
- While these preferences reflect averages, the research acknowledges individual variations in taste, offering hope for funny women and humor-challenged men in the dating scene.
- The study's methodology involved surveying both genders on partner preferences related to humor and conducting hypothetical ""spend"" experiments to gauge humor trait valuations.

Remarks: Hibbard - seen here in an episode from the third season of 'The Biggest Loser' - recently called the program 'a fat-shaming disaster' Hibbard did not  respond to a request for comment. She recently told the New York Post that 'The whole f****** show is a fat-shaming disaster that I’m embarrassed to have participated in.' She also told the Post that '[The trainers] would say things to contestants like, ""You’re going die before your children grow up."" ""You’re going to die, just like your mother."" ""We’ve picked out your fat-person coffin"" - that was in a text message. One production assistant told a contestant to take up smoking because it would cut her appetite in half.' Hibbard also alleged that she suffered health issues, telling the newspaper that 'My hair was falling out. My period stopped. I was only sleeping three hours a night.' At the time, NBC told the Post 'Our contestants are closely monitored and medically supervised. The consistent ""Biggest Loser"" health transformations of over 300 contestants through 16 seasons of the program speak for themselves.'","Kai Hibbard, who appeared on NBC's weight-loss competition 'The Biggest Loser,' has reportedly penned an expose on the hit reality show program .
Hibbard worked on the book with Deborah Baer .
She finished as the first runner-up during the show's third season .","The article discusses an upcoming exposé book written by Kai Hibbard, a former contestant on the weight-loss reality show ""The Biggest Loser."" The book, titled ""Too Fat, Too Thin, Can't Win,"" reportedly details controversial behind-the-scenes practices on the show, including alleged fat-shaming, harsh comments from trainers, and lack of proper care for contestants' health and well-being. Hibbard, who finished as the runner-up in season 3, claims that the show refused to provide new underwear for contestants as they lost weight, leading to embarrassing situations. She also alleges that trainers made cruel remarks off-camera, such as telling contestants they would die young or had already picked out their ""fat-person coffin."" Additionally, Hibbard says she experienced concerning health issues like hair loss, amenorrhea, and sleep deprivation during her time on the show. While NBC declined to comment, the network had previously defended the show's medical supervision of contestants.

Tyler, 15, received an outpouring of support globally after he uploaded two photos of his Facebook conversation with his father - which took place last December - to his Tumblr account. In the messages, his father apparently wrote that the news his son is gay is an 'embarrassment', he has been left 'shamed' and 'ridiculed' and he feels like he is 'going to puke'. Tyler revealed to Daily Mail Online that he has not seen his dad for three months - and has even moved out of his family's home in Vancouver, Canada, to his aunt's house, also in the city. Scroll down for video . Disagreement: Tyler (right), 15, who revealed his father (left), had dubbed his coming out as 'worse than death' in online messages, told Daily Mail Online that he had not spoken to him since the exchange . Divided: Tyler received an outpouring of support globally after he uploaded two photos of his Facebook conversation with his father - which took place last December - to his Tumblr account. Above, the teenager is seen (right, at the back) several years ago with his father, mother, and two sisters in a family photo . The teen said the support he has received following the 'physically painful' Facebook conversation has lifted his spirits and helped him think positively, adding: 'I have no time for tears.' Tyler, whose  mother and two  sisters still live with his father, said: 'I haven't heard from my father at all. I moved out to my aunt's house a few weeks after he sent the messages. 'He sent them a week after I came out during December, and I haven't spoken to him since then. The rest of my family were kind of blown away by how much attention [the photos] have drawn. 'I initially just posted them in anger and disappointment to my Tumblr blog because that is usually where I vent and rant about stuff. I never thought that it was going to [escalate] like this.' He added: 'I visit my mom and sisters whenever my dad is at work.' The teenager said he had known he was gay 'since fifth grade', but had been worried about coming out publicly - particularly because his relationship with his father had been 'rocky for a long time'. 'I had a feeling he wasn't going to like it. But I had to tell him. I couldn't keep it anymore,' he said. In the images, posted on Monday, the father apparently tells his son the news of his sexuality is an 'embarrassment', that he has been left 'shamed' and 'ridiculed' and that he feels like he is 'going to puke' 'This is worse than death': Tyler told Daily Mail Online that he has not seen his dad for three months - and has even moved out of his family's home in Vancouver, Canada, to his aunt's house in the city . Not alone: The teenager came out to his sisters first, who were extremely supportive. Then, he came out to his mother, who was shocked, but ultimately supported him. Above, Tyler, his mom (right) and two other women . Tyler told the news to his sisters first, who were extremely supportive. Then, he came out to his mother, who was shocked, but ultimately supported him. Eventually, he told his father. But instead of responding to Tyler in a loving manner, the father apparently sent a series of offensive Facebook messages to his son, reading: ‘We took care of you since you were a baby. 'We loved you, took care of you when you’re sick. Lost many days and nights in all your fifteen years. Now this is what we get in return, shame and embarrassment. 'If only you didn't reject God and His teachings in your life you could have been strong enough to stay from evil and scums that surrounds you. Stay away.' In further messages, perhaps in response to the Tumblr post - which Tyler initially posted in December before it went viral this month - he added: 'Take out your post from social media. 'You embarrass me from all the people I knew. I'm going to puke. Whatever you do it reflects on me. People will ridicule me, insult me, and I might turn out to be a criminal.' Despite his father's reaction to his coming out, Tyler told Daily Mail Online that all of his other relatives - including the aunt with whom he is staying - and friends were 'supportive and non-judgmental'. 'Even the friends that I thought were going to shun me out accepted me,' he said. In relation to his feelings about his father's reaction, Tyler added: 'I honestly don't have time for being sad. 'I mean, I'm on Spring Break and I have to finish a math booklet and a French speech. [I have] no time for tears. I'm just hoping that that my father will come around.' Supported: Despite his father's reaction to his coming out, Tyler (pictured in online photos) said all of his other relatives - including the aunt with whom he is staying - and friends were 'supportive and non-judgmental' 'Be proud'; On Monday, Tyler re-tweeted a series of supportive messages from strangers and friends alike . The teen was applauded for his bravery by users on Twitter, with one saying: 'Always stay true to yourself' He added that the outpouring of support from people across the world has been 'just amazing', saying that it has made his blog post 'more meaningful' and could help others in his situation. He said his mother and older sister 'have mixed feelings' about the attention his post has brought, but his younger sister 'doesn't really mind' because she 'doesn't really know what's happening'. One of the messages of support the teenager has received reads: 'Mate, from the other side of the Atlantic, be proud of how you are born. Hope everything comes around with your dad.' Meanwhile, a Twitter user named Katerina told Tyler: 'Your father is ignorant and he needs some education on many matters, bc I suppose he is not so narrow minded only regarding this.' Another, named Naithom, posted: 'I'm so sorry for the way your dad's handling the situation. Please surround yourself w/ people who love & care for you as you are.' 'You are brave': Strangers reached out to him on the social network, offering words of advice and support . 'Love from NC': Mom-of-three Sarah MckKee, from North Carolina, said 'a parent should love unconditionally' Disappointed: On his blog post, alongside the images of his and his father's Facebook exchange, Tyler wrote the words: 'My dad’s reaction to me coming out. Can’t even say it to my face smh (shaking my head)' And Marshall Moore told the teenager: 'Just read about your story. Different generation but I still get it. Stay strong and please don't give up on yourself. Love wins.' Mr Moore added in a separate online post: 'Every time I see a story like this, I foam at the mouth. The world should've moved on by now. Obviously it hasn't.' Pensioner Jacqui Christensen also spoke out in support of Tyler, saying: 'I'm a 75 year old woman, mother to three children. Be proud of who you are. What your father is saying is so unfair.' She added: 'People choose to have children. Caring for them is part of the deal. Parents should respect who that child is; what he becomes.' Tyler and his younger sister were born in Vancouver, while their older sister moved to the city with their parents from the Philippines when she was three. Two of their aunts later moved to the city. Tyler's mother works in the packaging department at a health supplement factory. His father is also employed, but his job is unknown. His sisters are believed to still be in school. On his  blog post, alongside the images of his and his father's Facebook exchange, Tyler wrote: 'My dad’s reaction to me coming out. Can’t even say it to my face smh (shaking my head). This is terrible please find someone in your life who cares, they’re there I promise.This physically hurts to read.'

A quadruple amputee Rottweiler named Brutus is getting the chance to walk again thanks to a new set of artificial limbs . Brutus, who lives in Loveland, Colorado, is only the second dog to ever have four prosthetic limbs . But now Brutus has a loving foster mother in Laura Aquilina, who is training the dog so he can get used to a life with artificial limbs. 'You can't explain to an animal why you are putting these contraptions on their feet,' she told Fox 31 Denver. 'You can't explain it to them, that it's to help them.' Brutus' new limbs, which he was outfitted with in September 2014, gives him a high step that  resembles a 'bucking bronco'. Although Brutus can now take walks outside, Aquilina wants more for the two-year-old dog. 'It's not always pretty,' she said.

OrthoPets founder Martin Kauffman said Brutus was 'dealt a short hand' but can now  'get out and do normal doggy things'. 'It just makes you feel so good,' he told Fox 31 Denver. Aquilina said Brutus is an example of why people shouldn't give up on animals with disabilities. 'If he ended up in a shelter they'd say he was unadoptable because he's missing his feet,' she said.

Ex-Coronation Street star Scott Wright is convinced he has the answer after conducting a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love. The actor, who played stripper Sam Kingston in the soap and was previously crowned Rear Of The Year, went on the world's most popular mobile dating app  with five very different looks. He wanted to see which profile would get the most 'matches' - where women indicate they are up for a date. Scroll down for video . Ex-Coronation Street star Scott Wright, who played Sam Kingston in the soap, conducted a unique experiment to show just what men should be wearing to find love on Tinder. He wore five different outfits and discovered that going topless garnered the most matches (it probably helps that he's a personal trainer) By far the most popular of 40-year-old Scott's looks was when he stripped off for a topless profile picture. Within minutes of his profile going live, Scott had 28 matches from attractive women all eager to engage with the star, who now combines acting with a successful career as a fitness guru. This profile was seven times more successful that Scott's least popular profile - where he was dressed smartly in a work jacket and shirt, which attained just four matches. Once he posted each profile, he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives to gauge the popularity of each look. The 'chav look' was the second most successful of the five. Right: Scott concluded that the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture, which, he says, perhaps explains why the 'normal bloke' look got 16 matches . Stylists created five different looks for Scott: smart, chav, hipster, normal bloke and muscle man. Once he posted each profile, he sent out 100 likes to women near where he lives in Manchester to gauge the popularity of each look - and waited to see how many matches he achieved. The experiment was carried out over two weeks at Tinder's peak times between 6pm and 8pm - with Scott targeting different women so that the same women were not matching with him. Scott reckoned the key to dating success is to make sure female suitors are not intimidated by your profile picture. Scott's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches . That might explain why the 'chav' look, where Scott wore a zip-up top, tracksuit bottoms and trainers got 17 matches, and 'normal bloke' got 16 matches. Scott's high fashion hipster look with a cap was the second least successful with just 10 matches. If Scott's experiment is anything to go by, dressing smartly virtually kills your chances of dating success with Scott's profile picture in a jacket and shirt getting just four matches. Scott made no mention of his previous TV fame because he just wanted to be judged on his pictures, though some Tinder users may have recognised him. The least successful of the lot was Scott's suited and booted look, which landed him just four matches . Speaking about his experiment, Scott said: 'Obviously because of my work in fitness I am in pretty good shape, so I guess it is no surprise that going topless is the best way to get matches on Tinder. 'I am thinking this strategy may not be be quite as successful if you have a beer belly and man boobs!. 'Seriously, what it shows is that online dating is a minefield and by making small tweaks to your profile pictures, you can significantly increase your chances of dating success.' A spokesperson for Theidleman.com, who provided the clothes for the experiment, added: 'What this shows is that men need to be comfortable in their own skin when they are dating online - and I think the same applies when they are dressing to look good. 'What most men want to do is pass the pub test: find clothes that look sufficiently good that their mates won't take the mickey out of them in down the pub. 'If they pass that test with their mates, they will also adopt the right look when dating online.'","The actor, who played stripper Sam Kingston, carried out experiment .

Scott Wright, a former Coronation Street actor, conducted an experiment on Tinder to determine which type of profile picture would garner the most matches from women. He created five different looks - smart, chav, hipster, normal, and topless - and sent out 100 likes to local women for each profile. The topless picture was by far the most successful, receiving 28 matches within minutes, while the smart look in a jacket and shirt received only 4 matches. The ""chav"" look with a zip-up top and tracksuit bottoms was second most popular with 17 matches. Wright concluded that the key to online dating success is ensuring your profile picture doesn't intimidate potential matches, which may explain why the regular ""normal bloke"" look performed moderately well with 16 matches compared to the hipster look's 10 matches.

Shelia Jones, who is in charge of more than 200 pupils at St Joseph's Roman Catholic primary school in Devizes, Wiltshire, allegedly humiliated the children on more than one occasion, it is claimed. Angry parents have written to the school's governors and complained to the education watchdog Ofsted after the revelations came to light. Tammy Brimble claims her 11-year-old son Cyrus was among three other boys threatened by Mrs Jones with a 'phone call to God' and is calling for her to resign. She said: 'I didn't find out about it will we got home. Cyrus was very quiet and I could tell something was bothering him. 'When he told me what had happened to him and three other boys, I was upset but I wanted to find out why she did it. 'I don't think what she did was appropriate at all. We are not Roman Catholics but it was still distressing for my child for her to call on God like that.' Mrs Brimble made several attempts to speak to the headteacher and eventually wrote a letter of complaint to the school governors and Ofsted. She said in a letter to Simon Napper, deputy chairman of the governors: 'Cyrus has been subjected to the humiliation of being punished by Sheila on more than one occasion by having to lie face down on the floor. 'We have witnesses for this too, and the evidence of the harm this has caused him.' Another parent, Alexandra Jones, who used to work as a lunchtime supervisor, has also complained to Ofsted. Furious parents at have complained to the school's (pictured) governors and Ofsted after the revelations . She said: 'All the children were whispering about something and then it came out that Sheila had made some of them lie face down in the prayer room while she pretended to ring God on her mobile phone.' Ofsted has asked Wiltshire Council's safeguarding panel to investigate the parents' complaints. In a letter to another parent who cited 'problems' at the school, Ofsted replied: 'The information provided raised concerns about the safety of children. 'Ofsted has shared your concerns with the local authority so they can progress these safeguarding concerns as they consider appropriate.' The school, which was rated as 'needing improvements' at its last Ofsted review in February 2013, is due to receive inspectors for a fresh assessment within a few days. The education watchdog said it was not willing to comment further. Colette Culligan, chairman of the governors, said: 'We are aware of an allegation against one of the teaching staff. 'In order to follow due process, all inquiries regarding this issue need to be directed to Wiltshire Council. The school, founded in 1864 (pictured), is said to be aware of the allegation and the issue has been directed to Wiltshire Council. The local authority says it will need to receive a letter from Ofsted before investigating . 'This is to ensure that any investigation currently being conducted is not unduly influenced.' A Wiltshire Council spokesman said: 'Once we have received the letter from Ofsted we will look into any concerns raised.' On the school's website, Mrs Jones claims in her welcome message that the faith school is 'built on gospel values of love, tolerance, forgiveness and compassion'. She adds: 'We aim to be a loving community which is inspired by the life and teaching of Jesus Christ.' The school was founded in 1864 when a group of sisters opened a Roman Catholic 'poor school' in an improvised Roman Catholic chapel and has been called St Joseph's since 1886. It has previously come under fire in another row where teachers called for Mrs Jones to resign after she was accused of being a 'liability' by parents. Governors said in February they had investigated but dismissed the complaints and agreed lessons needed to be learned.

With the pound strengthening against the euro and other currencies, prices have dropped by as much as 22 per cent over last year in three quarters of the cities included in Post Office Travel Money's annual report on city costs. Eastern European cities offer bargain hunters the best value with Vilnius, Lithuania, topping the list. Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, offers bargain hunters the best value as a city break destination, says a study . Budapest, Hungary, also offers British travellers a great deal, with a weekend getaway tallying £119.77 . The newest eurozone member has seen a fall of over 15 per cent year-on-year with a three-course evening meal for two including drinks and two nights' accommodation coming in at just £100.04. The cost of a weekend break in Vilnius is half of what visitors would pay in perennial favourites Paris, Rome and Amsterdam. Budapest is another great money-saving destination, where a two night getaway comes in at just £119.77. And in Riga, travellers will not only benefit from cheap transport options, but also the cheapest rate (£36) for a two-night stay in a three-star city centre hotel during the month of April. In Riga, Latvia, not only is transport extremely affordable, but three-star city centre hotels are cheapest . And when it comes to Western Europe, Post Office Travel Money recommends heading to Athens for a deal . 1. Vilnius, Lithuania - £100.04 . 2. Budapest, Hungary - £119.77 . 3.

Krakow, Poland - £144.96 . 10. Strasbourg, France - £169.60 . *Cost of two nights' accommodation and a three-course meal for two with drinks . But it's not only Eastern Europe that offers UK tourists some serious value. Athens, which is a new entry in the report, comes in fifth with a weekend city break coming in at just £131.35, which puts it as the cheapest in Western Europe. Last year's cheapest Western break, Lisbon, dropped to eighth place this year. The Czech city of Prague also offers great bang for a British traveller's buck, boasting cheap meals and drinks. Dining out costs as little as £23.94 for two people, while a bottle of beer is just £1.13. Krakow, Poland, and Strasbourg, France, are two additional new entries to the list this year. Proving that not all French cities must be needlessly expensive, Strasbourg is noteworthy for being 35 per cent cheaper than Paris. For the third consecutive year, Stockholm is Europe's most expensive city with holidaymakers spending an average of £311.01 for a two-night getaway. London is the seventh most expensive city break, with costs averaging £266.65, according to the study. While perennial favourite, Paris, is a very expensive French destination, Strasbourg offers good value . If money is not a concern, Stockholm has been named Europe's most expensive city for the third year in a row . Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'It's a win/win situation for UK holidaymakers this year in European cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed, thanks to the soaring value of sterling.' However, he does recommend that travellers do their homework before setting out, as prices do vary significantly across cities. 'Remember that the cost of meals and drinks will need to be added into the spending budget, as city breaks are never all-inclusive holidays,' he explains. 'Over the course of a two- or three-night break, these can make a big difference to the cost of a city break and the low prices in Prague, Athens and Budapest will make these cities strong contenders for a bargain break rival to the Baltic states.'","Weekend breaks have overtaken beach holidays as most popular getaway .

Let the summary format emerge organically based on thoroughly capturing the essence, rather than enforcing strict templates. The length and structure should adapt flexibly to effectively communicate the text's core meaning and implications.

Reasoning:
For this multi-sentence text summarization task, the key objectives are:
1) Comprehensive analysis to derive insights
2) Coherent communication of those insights 

The system prompt encourages the crucial reasoning process of extracting key information, exploring motivations/implications, and connecting components logically.

The user prompt provides a lightweight framing while allowing flexibility:
- It specifies summarizing the ""essential points"" from the article
- But does not overly constrain the structure beyond a ""coherent multi-sentence paragraph""
- It guides the model to focus on conveying complete and accurate insights through a clear narrative flow

This balances the need for a coherent summary structure with the freedom to adapt that structure organically based on the text's content and implications. The prompt emphasizes thorough reasoning over rigid adherence to templates.

Recent evaluations revealed areas for improvement in reasoning depth and output structure for this task type. By highlighting those areas specifically, the prompt centers the model's attention on those aspects during the reasoning and summarization process.

No examples are included as the summarization task is relatively straightforward, and overly detailed examples could be counterproductive by suggesting restrictive templates. The prompt allows the model to apply its understanding flexibly.

The department released its discipline records last week after receiving a request to obtain them by The Salt Lake Tribune. Wilkinson, who received a three-day suspension, and Hansen, who received a one-day suspension, were at the Big Shot Ranch near Grantsville in June when British bikini models posed for photos and were videotaped firing guns for a calendar called 'Hot Shots.' The two men were seen wearing camouflage uniforms identifying them as police in a promotional video filmed at Camp Williams in May and posted on YouTube in October. Scroll down for video . Risque: The models were at Camp Williams for a Hot Shots pinup calendar and behind-the-scenes video shoot. Two Utah peace officers were disciplined as a result . Exposed: Men were spotted in the promotional video wearing camouflage gear with 'police' on the back . Neither Wilkinson nor Hansen sought their superiors' permission to participate, and superiors learned of the activity only when they saw video clips played by the news media in Utah, according to the records. The men were disciplined for conduct that brings discredit to an officer or agency, and for wearing their uniform during a promotion for a product — both rules violations, the records show. Wilkinson and Hansen declined comment. An acquaintance asked the two to help supervise the firing line where the models shot at targets, according to an internal affairs report. The report also notes Hot Shots purports to donate a portion of its proceeds to charities for wounded soldiers. In November, four Utah National Guard soldiers were disciplined for their unauthorized involvement and use of military vehicles in a video featuring the bikini-clad women firing high-powered weapons and riding in tanks.

Online booking agent Wotif confirmed they are dumping their $5.50 hotel booking fee which could put some $20 million dollars back into the pockets of Australian consumers. They are also removing credit card costs and surcharges on full service flights that would have set consumers back $16.95 however they will keep a surcharge on low cost airlines of $9.95 per person. Wotif have dumped excess booking fees which could save Australians $20 million a year . While Wotif has been praised for the move, consumers who expected to see a drop in prices  may be disappointed as the company is believed to have increased the commission levied on accommodation for bookings made via its website from 12 to 15 per cent, reported Newscorp. Tom Godfrey thinks there needs to be a regulatory body to stop companies from charging exorbitant prices for using a credit card or booking online . Tom Godfrey from CHOICE told Daily Mail Australia that an increase in commission prices could be an effort to further 'fleece' customers in a bid to offset losses from dropping the controversial credit card fees. Wotif said the change is not a bid to recoup costs lost by the surcharge but a reflection on their recent acquisition by competing company Expedia. Mr Godfrey said the rise in commission will increase up front costs of travel however the removal of the credit card surcharging is win for consumers and a clear warning to other companies who continue to ‘flout’ the ban on excessive charges. ‘It’s great to see consumers unite to drive change because it sends clear signal to businesses that we aren't happy.’ He said excessive credit card charges are costing Australian’s over a billion dollars a year, with some of the ‘worst offenders’ being Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin and Tiger. ‘People are sick and tired of being ripped off by the top end of town,' he said. Klaus Bartosch, the business man responsible for an anti surcharge petition that's been signed by over 100,000 people, welcomes the change and agrees this move puts more pressure on other major players to respond to 'consumer sentiment' by removing 'outrageous fees'. 'No where else in the world does this exist,' he said. Mr Bartosch started an online petition to stop airlines and travel companies from taking advantage of consumers by charging 'ridiculous' amounts for using credit cards . Mr Bartosch said prices are 'misleading' and not an accurate reflection of what businesses are actually paying to use credit cards. 'They are just plucking these figures from their backsides to rip of consumers,' he told Daily Mail Australia. CHOICE recently released a report that shows merchants are only paying around 0.8 per cent for Visa and Mastercard and 2 per cent for prestige cards like America Express and Diners Club. According to the latest research data made available by MasterCard, Australian consumers are being surcharged about $1.6 billion each year. Qantas, Tiger, Jetstar and Virgin continue to flout the ban on excessive credit card surcharges . Mr Bartosch believes these numbers prove that Australian's are facing excessive surcharges and that companies 'can not be trusted to self regulate'. CHOICE have also called for a regulator who have explicit legal power to limit credit card surcharges. According to Mr Godfrey excessive surcharging needs to be regulated by a body with the power to demand evidence of fair pricing and subsequently enforce significant penalties for non compliance. 'For too long hotels and airlines have been thumbing their nose at the government and there needs to be a regulatory body who have more power to enforce the ban,' Mr Godfrey said.","Wotif have removed a controversial $5.50 credit card surcharge .
This comes two years after the RBA banned excessive surcharging .
Watchdog CHOICE said this is great news for consumers .
They say this will pressure other major players to drop unfair fees .
While surcharging has been removed, Wotif increased commission rates .

Wotif, a major online travel booking company, has removed excess credit card surcharges and a $5.50 hotel booking fee in compliance with regulations limiting such charges to reasonable costs, potentially saving Australian consumers $20 million annually. However, Wotif increased commission rates on accommodations from 12% to 15%, which consumer advocates view as an attempt to offset lost revenue from the removed fees. The article highlights ongoing concerns about companies charging excessive credit card surcharges well above their actual processing costs, with airlines like Qantas, Jetstar, Virgin and Tiger cited as major offenders flouting the ban on excessive charges. Consumer groups are calling for a regulatory body with legal authority to demand pricing evidence and enforce penalties, as self-regulation has proven ineffective in curbing this billion-dollar issue impacting Australians.",0.8214285714285717,"Thoroughly analyze the given text to extract key information, underlying motivations, and broader implications.

The boy, who has not been named, was caught speeding down Strand at 5.30pm  when he suddenly swerved into four lanes of oncoming traffic, weaving through cars as they tried to avoid him. Police say the dangerous stunt led to him being arrested, banned from the roads for 12 months, and being given a youth rehabilitation order and a curfew.

The teenager (top centre) was banned from the roads for 12 months and given a youth rehabilitation order and a curfew after the stunt which took place at the peak of the evening rush hour . Footage of the daylight crime was released by Merseyside Police during a crackdown on illegal and antisocial use of off-road bikes during which 28 bikes were seized during early morning raids. Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roy said: 'He is lucky to be alive and the case clearly highlights the risks for the entire community when off-road bikes are ridden in this way. 'Today's action is all about responding to the concerns of communities across Merseyside and targeting those people who we believe have been using scrambler bikes in a dangerous or anti-social way. 'We know that many people are plagued by the problem of off-road vehicles and actually find them incredibly intimidating. 'When they are ridden dangerously, they pose a huge risk, not only to the safety of the rider but also to pedestrians and other law-abiding road users. 'We know that there are still scramblers, quads and other vehicles out there which are being ridden dangerously or anti-socially, and I hope today shows that when we have information, we will act on it to tackle the problem.'

The teenager was captured on CCTV driving the correct way down Strand road moments before swerving into the opposite lane as car try to dodge around him . He added: 'I would appeal to people across Merseyside to carry on calling us if they know where nuisance bikes are being stored or they have information about the people who are using them.' Merseyside's Police Commissioner Jane Kennedy said: 'Residents, farmers and businesses have raised with me many times their concerns about the illegal and anti-social use of scrambler and quadbikes.

However, the move has raised eyebrows among the local clergy, who fear the sacrament is being abused on the smartphone app, which deletes pictures and messages seconds after receiving them. Despite @priestDavid claiming he wants to make confession easier, others see a cynical ploy to get people to admit their failings and mistakes to a complete stranger, who has not proven he is a member of any church or even a priest. Available to hear your confession: Christian priests in San Antonio have warned against young people offering to confess their sins to @priestDavid . 'It's not confession. It's not what the sacrament is all about,' said local San Antonio priest, the Reverend Tony Vilano to News 4 in San Antonio. 'He's not a Catholic priest. The church teaches when you go to confession, you should go to a priest either behind a divider or face to face.' While it is not known what Christian denomination @priestDavid is, he claims the Snapchat confession is part of a college student's project he is helping with. He also told News 4 he wants to engage more young people and claims he has been a priest for 23-years. The confessions will be heard for two weeks from March 2 to March 16. Unethical: Confession as a sacrament is meant to be performed in person to a priest - either divided by a veil or in some cases face-to-face . Traditional: This is the way that confessions have been heard for over a thousand years . 'Doing it Snapchat, I mean, you can do Snapchat or through the internet and list everything you've done and there's no humility in there. There's no ownership of the sins you've committed,' said Rev. Vilano to News 4. Others are more damning of @priestDavid. Archdiocese of San Antonio Deacon Pat Rodgers vehemntly disagrees with using Snapchat for confessions. He said that in fact the man, if he is a priest, has gone rogue and that confessions must take place face-to-face. News 4 in San Antonio took to the street to ask the public their opinions. 'Ridiculous. Absurd. That's what the Catholic church is for. Internet is not reality. You want confession, go see a priest,' said Richard de Leon III to News 4. In a statement, the Episcopal Diocese of West Texas said: 'The Episcopal Diocese of West Texas recognizes there are various ways churches can reach out to people through social media. However, Episcopalians are not asked to present private confessions to a priest, instead confession is offered in worship, as part of the church's liturgy.'","San Antonio priest  @priestDavid offering confessions via Snapchat app .
Local religious leaders in Texas have warned young people not to use it .","The article discusses a controversial move by someone calling themselves '@priestDavid' who is offering to hear confessions through the Snapchat app. Local clergy in San Antonio have raised concerns, stating that confession is a sacred sacrament that should be done in person with an ordained priest, not anonymously through a social media app. Key points include:

- @priestDavid claims to want to make confession more accessible, especially for young people, through the Snapchat app which deletes messages quickly. 

- However, local priests argue this undermines the solemnity and personal nature of confession, stripping it of humility and ownership of one's sins.

- The Archdiocese deacon states if @priestDavid is truly a priest, he has gone rogue, as confessions must occur face-to-face per Catholic tradition.

- Other Christian denominations like the Episcopal Diocese also do not recognize app-based confessions as valid, seeing it as antithetical to liturgical confession practices.

- The public appears to view the Snapchat confession idea as absurd and ridiculous, insisting confession should only happen with an ordained priest in a church setting.

Overall, while @priestDavid positions it as modernizing confession, religious authorities condemn the app-based practice as unethical, impersonal, and a violation of the sacred nature of confessions.",0.8142857142857144,"Thoroughly analyze the given text to extract key information, underlying motivations, and broader implications.

Restrained: Clayton Osbon, 52, pictured here being taken off a New York to Las Vegas flight after his breakdown, is suing JetBlue for failing to recognize he was mentally ill . Osbon moved slowly during pre-flight checks for the flight to Las Vegas from New York, and later relieved himself of duty after being told by the first officer he had missed several calls from air traffic control, the lawsuit adds. After a co-pilot locked Osbon out of the cockpit, he 'ran down the aisles screaming and ranting concerning imagined terrorism and the need for all on board on embrace religion.' The lawsuit alleges that JetBlue allowed the flight to continue for three hours and 'unnecessarily endangered the lives of Captain Osbon, the crew and the 135 passengers.' There were no injuries on the flight, which eventually made an emergency landing in Amarillo, Texas. The meltdown resulted from a complex partial brain seizure that 'severely impaired his ability to perform basic activities, caused him to hallucinate, and caused extreme feelings of paranoia and religious fervor,' according to the suit.

Nearly three dozen passengers sued JetBlue in 2012 for being 'grossly negligent' by allowing Osbon to fly with unchecked mental issues. JetBlue eventually settled the lawsuit in April of the following year for an undisclosed sum. After the flight was grounded in Texas, Osbon was indicted on charges of interfering with a flight crew and found not guilty by reason of insanity.

The incident resulted from a seizure that caused hallucinations and paranoia, according to the lawsuit, which also claims the airline routinely ignored crew impairment to protect careers. Osbon was indicted but found not guilty by reason of insanity, and has not had another seizure since starting medication, though he remains suspended without his $300,000+ salary.

Urevick says she started searching for her daughter in Camden, where her daughter had gotten into trouble with the law and occasionally Urevick heard troubling rumors.

Self-styled coyote spotters in and around Chappaqua have counted 160 incursions into backyards and streets over the last two years and at least 10 recent attacks on pets. That's been enough to stir animal passions among residents over the question of when and if a coyote deserves to be killed. Email and social media have swirled with such teeth-baring terms as 'coyote jihad' and 'death map.' And members of a local task force that advocates trapping and killing some of the animals announced they were staying away from a recent public hearing on the issue 'in the interest of our personal safety.' Scroll down for video . Victim: Pet owner Ann Styles Brochstein holds her Havanese dog Samson near where Samson was attacked by a coyote outside her home in Chappaqua, New York . Sighting: The New Castle Coyote Management Task Force is arguing for more frequent use of 'lethal solutions' against coyotes. A Facebook page for the group posted this photo of a coyote seen November 16, 2014 . Wounded: The anti-coyote New Castle Coyote Management Task Force included this photo of dogs injured by the wild animals at the end of a presentation . 'I envisioned going down there and having blood thrown on me,' said task force member Joyce Stansell-Wong, who has since resigned. Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a playground for coyotes. But wildlife officials say the demise of such predators as wolves and cougars over the last few decades has led to a spread of coyotes into more populated areas across the East Coast, including suburbs. Instagram and Facebook are replete with pictures of the canines scampering across sidewalks and among backyard playsets. Coyotes have even been spotted in New York City's Central Park and the Bronx. Robert Greenstein, supervisor of the Town of New Castle, which has about 18,000 residents in Chappaqua, Millwood and unincorporated areas, said that in general, the debate is between two camps: 'One group is concerned with protecting the coyotes and the other group is more concerned with protecting our pets.' The pet-protection camp, represented by the New Castle Coyote Management Task Force, argues for quicker use of 'lethal solutions.' Even though there have been no attacks on humans, they fear the skulking canines may start to attack small children. 'A menacing coyote, circling the playground, stalking children, that coyote has to go,' said task force member Ann Styles Brochstein, whose Havanese dog Samson was attacked by a coyote in their yard. Famous residents: Chappaqua, about 35 miles north of the city, is better known as the home of former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton than as a coyote playground (file photo) 'Residents have had to alter their lifestyle significantly,' she said. 'Taking out the garbage, grilling in backyards, walking children home from bus stops and the simple act of walking dogs have all attracted coyotes. They appear on porches and decks, looking through doors at children and pets.' A separate group, represented by the New Castle Coyote Awareness and Safety Advisory Committee, is advocating more tolerance, noting that coyote attacks on humans are very unusual and that a little education — and keeping pets on leashes — can help limit close encounters. In general, they would limit killings to coyotes that attack humans or leashed pets. 'We must encourage responsible pet ownership and not penalize a coyote for taking a small dog when such an act is only doing what comes naturally,' said Victoria Alzapiedi, chairwoman of the advisory committee. In the public meeting on the issue Feb. 10, the advisory committee gave its presentation. The absent task force submitted its presentation online. Both groups did extensive research, spoke with experts and appear to agree that coexistence is inevitable. They differ, however, on the current effectiveness of 'hazing' coyotes, or trying to instill a fear of humans by making a noisy commotion when a coyote is spotted. The task force says some coyotes have gotten used to such displays and pay scant attention. New York's Department of Environmental Conservation would have to approve any shooting or trapping. Coyotes that are trapped are then euthanized rather than taken to another area. The department's guidelines offer some perspective, noting that 650 New Yorkers are hospitalized every year for dog bites and that while coyotes kill cats, 'so do foxes, dogs, bobcats, vehicles and even great horned owls.' Dan Bogan, a coyote expert who consults for the DEC, said, 'We're never going to get rid of coyotes. They're not going anywhere. People aren't going anywhere either. Coexistence is the solution.' Greenstein said town board members are studying the proposals and will hold a public work session in the next month or two to discuss them. His prediction: 'That'll be Round 2 of the fireworks.'

He was found shot dead in the bathroom of his locked apartment in January, hours before he was due to testify against President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in the Argentinian Congress. He was trying to arrest the President after claiming she helped cover up Iran's alleged role in a 1994 bombing which killed 85 at a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires. The mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr Nisman's death unleashed a storm of conspiracy theories. His ex-wife, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, hired a private team to analyse the autopsy results and run additional tests. On the offensive: Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (left) has denied claims helped Iran cover up a terrorist attack. The claims were made by Alberto Nisman (right) - who was mysteriously shot dead . Argentine authorities have not released full results of his autopsy, more than six weeks after he was found sprawled in a pool of blood in his flat. The few details made public so far have suggested suicide, although the lead investigator into Mr Nisman's death said she could not categorically say if he shot himself in the head or was killed. But today, his ex-wife - the mother of their two children - said: 'Nisman didn't have an accident. He didn't commit suicide. They murdered him.' Earlier today, Ms Arroyo Salgado, who is a judge, deposited the forensic evidence backing up her allegations at the state prosecutors' office in Buenos Aires. She did not give details of the findings to journalists. Yesterday, a full-page advert, signed by the Government of Argentina and bearing an Argentinian flag, questioned Mr Nisman's motives and attacked his argument. 'One must ask oneself what objectives Nisman was pursuing with a complaint plagued with contradictions, lacking logic and without legal basis,' it declared. Mrs Kirchner: The president's name was on a draft warrant discovered in the home of Alberto Nisman . 'Can one think of a hypothesis other than seeking to generate a destabilising political effect?' Mr Nisman had accused the President and top administration officials of helping Iranian officials hide their and Iran's alleged role in the country's worst-ever terrorist attack. His 289-page investigation, which was published a few days after his death, was based on wiretaps of top administration officials that he argued proved the secret deal with Iran. According to Mr Nisman, the President allegedly orchestrated the deal in exchange for economic trade. Ms Kirchner rejected the allegations, and Iran denied any role in the bombing. The prosecutor was found shot in the head in his apartment in the capital's upmarket Puerto Madero district on January 18, triggering protests in the streets. His mysterious death triggered a PR fightback by the government, whose officials said the prosecutor was trying to smear the nation. Senior government official Gustavo Lopez claimed last month the allegations were part of an attempt to unseat the President and bring neoliberals back to power. 'We are facing an attempted coup d'etat, that aims to get rid of the president,' he wrote. But the alleged smears have upset other politicians. Cornelia Schmidt-Liermann told the Associated Press: 'It's awful to see so many accusations against a person who can't defend himself. 'Instead of clarifying anything, Fernandez is damaging the investigation into Nisman's death.' Anger: Protesters clashed with police after the death of the prosecutor in his locked apartment in January . Horror: The 1994 bombing of a Buenes Aires Jewish centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, left 85 dead and remains the country's most deadly terrorist attack. Iran has denied it was involved . Yesterday's newspaper advert highlighted a judge's ruling which said Mr Nisman's argument had a lack of 'coherence and integration'. Judge Daniel Rafecas, who made the ruling, said: 'There is not a single element of evidence, even circumstantial, that points to the head of state.' That ruling was appealed yesterday by prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita, who has taken up the case following Mr Nisman's death. He said the judges' decision was 'premature' and an investigation was needed to 'prove or disprove the facts'. The appeal sends the case to the Federal Chamber of judges, which can uphold or reject last week's decision by federal Judge Rafecas. Argentinians will go to the polls in October, but the President is barred from running for a third term by the country's constitution and will have to step down. She has nevertheless gone on the offensive, accusing opposition parties of using the row for political gain and claiming the U.S. and Israel were meddling in Argentina's affairs.","Alberto Nisman's body found in January a day before Congress hearing .

Angela Jones from Portsmouth underwent a gastric bypass in 2010 at Spires Southampton Hospital after ballooning to 26 stone. The mother of two had been suffering arthritis and struggled to exercise for much of her life. But within days of the operation the 42-year-old showed signs of complications, struggling to keep food down despite being given anti-nausea pills. Over the following years she was rushed in and out of hospital, with doctors forced to insert feeding tubes to keep her alive. Angela Jones died after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. The 42-year-old dropped from 24 stone (left) to just four in as many years.She died in March 2014 a few months after being photographed (right) In March 2014, weighing  20 stone less than when she underwent the surgery, the mother of two died. Her daughter Chantel has since told of how she wished her mother had never had the operation at all. 'I’ll never be able to forget the horror of how mum died. She thought the gastric bypass would be the start of a new life when she’d finally have the slim figure she always dreamed of,' she said. 'Yet by the end she was so thin, just a living skeleton confined to a wheelchair. 'She just faded away in front of my eyes. I won’t ever get over it.' 'I speak on behalf of the whole family when I say people often mistakenly think these operations are the answer to being obese. 'But the truth is we believe my mum would still be alive if she hadn’t had this done.' Mrs Jones, a former carer, struggled with her weight after being unable to exercise for much of her life, her daughter added. The mother of two with daughters Melissa (left) and Chantel (right). The women begged their mother not to undergo the surgery but had their fears dismissed when she believed doctors' advice, they said . Mrs Jones struggled with her weight for most of her life after being born with hip problems which made it difficult for her to exercise . 'Mum had always been overweight. She was born with a hip problems and developed arthritis that made exercise difficult.' Despite 'adoring' Chinese takeaways the mother of two made several attempts to lose weight. 'She tried every diet going but she just simply couldn't maintain her weight loss and whenever she lost a stone she‘d put it all back on again and more. Aged 37, her weight peaked at 26 stone. At just 4ft 9in, this gave Mrs Jones a BMI of 79, 49 points above the official classification for someone who is obese. The 42-year-old was in and out of hospital for three after having the operation. Above, she is at a healthy weight despite complications . After having treatment for a range of weight-related problems, doctors urged the woman to consider more drastic action. 'The doctors were blunt. In hindsight they frightened her into wanting the surgery,' said Chantel, 19. 'They said she would die without an operation. At the same time (my sister) Melissa and I were growing up and she longed to be slim and buy normal clothes. 'She was fed up of ordering outsize stuff and dreamed of accompanying us on clothes shopping trips.' Chantel and her sister begged their mother to avoid the surgery but say they were dismissed because she trusted doctors advice. After dropping two stone naturally, Mrs Jones underwent the procedure in hospital in 2010. Despite being unable to keep food down afterwards, doctors insisted she would recover, and sent her home. Yet despite being prescribed anti nausea drugs, the sickness continued. 'All her food had to be liquidised because she couldn't swallow any lumps at all. It was heartbreaking to see her having to drink her meals. Even then, often she still couldn’t keep anything down.' Within three months her weight had dropped to 18 stone. 'Mum was delighted about the weight loss but doctors were worried she was losing too much weight too fast.' Over the next six months Mrs Jones became gradually thinner, encountering a range of ailments including pancreatitis along the way. In March 2011, a year after the operation, she was rushed to hospital weighing just four stone - an astonishing 20 stone less than the previous year. There a feeding tube was directly inserted through her side into her stomach while doctors urgently tried to reverse some of the gastric bypass to allow Angela to eat more. 'She was in hospital for two months and when she came home it was terrible as not only could she still only eat liquidised food, she had to go through the indignity of being fed via a tube into her stomach every day,' said Chantel. 'Being fed through her stomach took ten hours of being hooked up to a machine – it was no life at all.' The stress of her health problems put pressure on her marriage to Chantel's father, Bryan, and he later left the family home. 'I would sit there begging mum to eat. In desperation I’d even try spoon-feeding her like a baby. 'But by now because every time she ate, she’d be sick, she’d developed a fear of food. She’d cry and in tears say she just couldn’t manage it. The 42-year-old became too frail to eat her own food and eventually contracted pneumonia. She is pictured at her daughter's wedding (top left) and in her home (right) in some of the last photographs taken of her . 'It broke our hearts.' In November that year, after being rushed to hospital having collapsed, Mrs Jones was told her organs were shutting down. She returned home two weeks later but was in and out of hospital over the next two years. In March 2014 Chantel woke up to find her mother had passed out on the sofa. She was rushed to hospital where doctors managed to revive her. Over 6,500 weight loss procedures are currently performed in the UK every year with gastric bypass one of the most common operations. This number is set to increase with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE) recommending the NHS should offer even more weight loss surgery to thousands more people to tackle the growing obesity epidemic. It works by inserting a small pouch at the top of the stomach. This is then connected to a section of the small intestine, bypassing the rest of the stomach and bowel. This means that it will take less food to make you feel full. Gastric bypass surgery is often favoured over gastric band surgery by doctors. This is because unlike a band – which temporarily makes the stomach smaller and can be removed - it is permanent. The patient and gives better weight loss results for the very obese. But devastatingly, three days later she died. A post mortem found Angela’s problems began when she had the bypass. 'A lack of food led to her losing too much weight and her body not being fed vital nutrients,' said Chantel. 'She was so frail she couldn't fight off any infection and finally died from pneumonia she'd picked up during a hospital stay. 'The gastric bypass starved her to death. She was skin and bone when she went.' The young mother, who welcomed baby Ruby-Mae seven months ago, said doctors did not properly warn her mother of the risks involved. 'Doctors presented this operation to mum as the answer to all her problems. If mum had been told all of the risks she never would have agreed to go ahead. 'We don’t feel the risk of severe side effects, which can be fatal, were ever properly explained to mum. 'We bitterly regret my mum ever allowed doctors to persuade her having weight loss surgery was the answer to her obesity problem.' 'I only hope telling mum’s tragic story makes anyone else think twice before having gastric surgery. 'If it stops just one person going through the same nightmare, it will be worth it.'","Angela Jones, 46, died in March last year three years after gastric bypass .

Warning: The islands of Svalbard are said to be the best place on earth to watch Friday's eclipse - but they are also home to about 3,000 polar bears, which are known to attack without warning . British teenager Horatio Chapple, a pupil at Eton College, was killed by a polar bear on Svalbard during a schools trek in 2011. Christin Kristoffersen, mayor of Svalbard's main settlement Longyearbyen, said she expected 1,500 visitors for the eclipse, on top of its 2,500 residents, meaning the numbers on the archipelago had reached a maximum safe limit. 'Safety comes first, even before the eclipse,' she said. 'We need to take care of people. It's terribly cold in March and wehave the challenge with polar bears.' Meanwhile, in Germany experts said the eclipse will be a good test of the country's electricity grid, which relies increasingly on renewable energy. The partial eclipse affecting Germany is expected to cause a sudden drop and then a surge in solar-generated power, which contributed almost 6 percent to Germany's energy mix last year. In Britain, some parts of the country will experience as much as 97 per cent darkness, and outdoor events will be held nationwide as people gather to gaze heavenwards at 8.45am. During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse. Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole. The next similar eclipse will not take place over Britain until August 2026.","People visiting Svalbard told to watch out for polar bears during eclipse .

The prosecution of journalists accused of paying public officials for leaks was in turmoil last night after law chiefs announced a review of all forthcoming trials or retrials. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, made the decision as anger grew that a ‘witch-hunt’ had been conducted to pursue reporters who exposed stories kept secret because they embarrassed those in power. Last week, Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, expressed misgivings that the obscure 13th century law of misconduct in public office was being used to haul journalists before the courts. Police and prosecutors have faced criticism for spending up to £20million of taxpayers’ money on Operation Elveden, an investigation into tabloid newspapers paying for information, rather than concentrating on terrorism and violent crime. Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service have brought to trial 24 journalists as part of the investigation, launched in the wake of phone-hacking allegations. But only three have been found guilty. And of those, a former News of the World reporter had her conviction for paying a prison officer for leaks quashed last week, while fellow journalist Ryan Sabey was given leave to appeal. The NoW reporter was the first journalist found guilty under Elveden and received a six-month suspended jail sentence. But on Friday, Lord Thomas overturned her conviction after finding Judge Charles Wide, who presided over the trial, ‘misdirected’ the jury over the ‘level of seriousness’ required to have committed an offence. Now it has emerged that the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will not face a retrial. Two co-defendants also had their convictions quashed but the prison officer is expected to be tried again. Mrs Saunders made the decision after holding emergency talks about the future of the prosecutions of the Press with senior barristers and the Metropolitan Police. A CPS spokesman said: ‘The Court of Appeal judgment from last week does not call into question the prosecution of the appellants concerned but considered that the jury needed greater direction on how serious offending must be to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust. ‘This ruling has been very carefully considered in relation to the cases against these three individuals and we have informed the Court of Appeal this afternoon of our decisions concerning retrials in each of those cases.’ The spokesman said the CPS would ‘consider the wider implications of last week’s judgment on this case and others within Operation Elveden’. Legal sources said Mrs Saunders had been forced to consider an ‘exit strategy’ after the so-called media crime investigations descended into chaos, with juries showing a reluctance to convict journalists who paid money for stories that were clearly in the public interest. Earlier this month, four Sun journalists  were acquitted of making illegal payments for stories. Former colour sergeant John Hardy, 44, was found not guilty of misconduct in a public office. Pictured left to right: Duncan Larcombe, John Hardy, Geoff Webster, Fergus Shanahan and John Kay . Earlier this month, four Sun journalists – John Kay, Duncan Larcombe, Fergus Shanahan, and Geoff Webster – were dramatically acquitted at the Old Bailey of making illegal payments for stories. And in January, a jury failed to reach verdicts in the trial of four current and former Sun journalists – Chris Pharo, Jamie Pyatt, Ben O’Driscoll and Graham Dudman. Their planned retrial in September will now be reviewed. Two fellow defendants – The Sun’s picture editor, John Edwards, and former reporter John Troup – were cleared of conspiring to commit misconduct in public office after a trial at Kingston Crown Court. Operation Elveden has seen journalists’ homes raided by police at dawn – a practice normally reserved for terror suspects and organised criminals – large numbers of arrests and reporters being kept on bail for up to three years. Critics have described the investigation as a ‘waste of public money’ and accused police and prosecutors of pursuing a ‘vendetta’ against journalists. A new Elveden trial was yesterday adjourned until April 24 in the wake of last week’s ruling. It involves a reporter who cannot be identified for legal reasons and prison officer Alan Hagan, 48, from Liverpool. They deny misconduct in public office. Eight trials and retrials involving tabloid journalists charged under Operation Elveden are scheduled between now and September.

The investigation has faced criticism for its substantial cost of up to £20 million while only securing a few convictions, with some already being overturned. The decision follows a Court of Appeal ruling that juries needed clearer guidance on the level of seriousness required for such offenses. Saunders will consider the wider implications of this judgment on ongoing Elveden cases, as juries have shown reluctance to convict journalists who paid for stories deemed in the public interest. The review signals potential changes in the approach to prosecuting journalists amidst growing concerns over the disproportionate resources dedicated to pursuing reporters rather than focusing on more serious crimes.",0.8150000000000001,"Thoroughly analyze the provided text to comprehend the key information, underlying motivations, and broader implications.

Marli van Breda has been transferred to a rehabilitation clinic after leaving Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town, on Tuesday, News24 reports. The former Perth schoolgirl has been in hospital since she was struck several times on the head and had her throat slashed in her family's South African home on January 27. Scroll down for video . Marli van Breda, 16, suffered severe brain damage when she was struck several times on the head in her family's South African home in January . Henri van Breda (back left) escaped the attack while his father Martin, 55 (back right), mother Teresa, 54 (front right), and brother Rudi, 22 (back centre) were killed. Marli, 16 (front left), suffered severe head and throat injuries . The attack claimed the lives of her mother Teresa, 54, father Martin, 55, and older brother Rudi, 22. Marli's other brother Henri, 20, escaped with light injuries and rang police to report the deaths at the Stellenbosch home, east of Cape Town. Family spokesman Martin Coetzee said Marli will undergo occupational and physical therapy at the rehabilitation clinic after six weeks in hospital. While her health has improved, Marli has not yet been able to make a complete police statement regarding the attack. She has been able to talk despite her injuries, but not for long periods. The family have not revealed the rehabilitation centre where Marli will be treated so her recovery can go ahead without disruptions. Chilling: An audio recording between Henri (right, pictured with brother Rudi) and emergency services after his family were hacked to death with an axe, revealed the 20-year-old appeared to giggle during the call . Marli was transferred to a rehabilitation clinic on Tuesday after spending six weeks at Vergelegen Medi-Clinic in Somerset West, just outside of Cape Town . It comes after reports last month that visitors had been banned from visiting the teenager's hospital room in a bid to keep her surviving brother away. 'They fear she might go into shock, or will be traumatised further if she sees him,' a source told  The Sunday Times newspaper. Marli has reportedly been crying when she sees photos of her parents and brother. 'It is heartbreaking to see tears rolling down her cheeks,' a person close to the family said. It emerged last month that an audio recording of the emergency phone call made by Henri, obtained by eNews Channel Africa, seems to reveal him 'giggling' as he explains the details of the bloody massacre. 'What kind of injuries are there?' a woman can be heard asking Henri, who responds: 'my family and me were attacked by a guy with an axe.' When asked if they were unconscious, he responded, 'yes, and bleeding from the head', before what sounds like a faint chuckle is heard. A cleaner who worked for one of the van Breda's neighbours saw the young man, covered in blood, using his phone outside the house shortly after the attack.

His younger brother Henri is currently living with his uncle Her after suffering light injuries .

The young man's mental health has been under scrutiny since News24 reported he had undergone brain scans at an Australian hospital in 2014. However the results were negative and no further testing occurred. A doctor who examined the young man following the attack revealed his injuries were self-inflicted. He was also reportedly addicted to tik and his allowance was cut off before his family were attacked. Henri has been living with his uncle, Her Breda, since the attack and has been receiving counselling. His uncle denied rumours the police wanted to keep him away from a private memorial service held for his deceased family - insisting he was simply being hidden from the media's gaze. Popular: Rudi Van Breda was popular with his friends at Trinity College and the University of Melbourne . Separated siblings: Rudi (left) was killed during the attack, while Marli (right) remains in a critical but stable condition in a South African hospital . A close family friend described the van Breda's as 'like a perfect family' 'For obvious reasons Henri is very heartbroken, and we will support him as the family,' he was quoted in The Times. 'We as a family are here for him, we will not disappoint him... I promise Henri I won't drop him.' No one has been charged over the attack on the family and Marli has a round-the-clock police guard.

Al-Abadi, who is also the top military commander, said on state television that the city was liberated. While al-Abadi has declared victory in the battle, pockets of fighting continues. Iraqi forces and Shiite militias are taking part in clearing operations. Iraqi forces reached the center of Tikrit and hoisted the nation's flag on top of the Governorate Building, al-Abadi said. Fighting continued on the outskirts of the city, he added. Tikrit had been under ISIS control since June. The push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes targeted ISIS targets around the city. The airstrikes made it possible for the Iraqi forces to move through the city. Troops reported finding dozens of roadside bombs and booby-trapped buildings as they combed the city. At a Cabinet meeting before he declared Tikrit liberated, al-Abadi was already calling the operation a success. ""The success of the Tikrit experiment will be repeated in other areas because of the results it has achieved on the battlefield, on a humanitarian level, protecting civilians as much as possible, in addition to the low casualties amongst our security forces,"" he said. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS conquered the city as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate but failed until now. This operation, however, was the biggest by the Iraqi military so far. ""We managed to take (ISIS) by surprise,"" the Prime Minister said. ""And our air force ... in addition to coalition air force, helping Iraqi forces, managed to deal severe blows to ISIS and the enemies of Iraq. And our ground forces with the blood of Iraqis, Iraqis alone with their own blood,  were able to liberate this land."" The latest push began after al-Abadi ordered Iraqi forces on March 1 to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and is located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. The Iraqi forces were aided by a coalition made up of mostly Shiite militiamen and volunteers. The militia members, estimated to number around 20,000, are backed by Iran. The offensive marked the first very overt participation of Iranian advisers on the front lines. The victory in Tikrit sets the stage for Iraqi forces to take back an even bigger prize: Mosul. Mosul is Iraq's second-biggest city and the site of one of its military's biggest embarrassments, when Iraqi troops dropped their weapons and ran rather than defend their posts last June. A U.S. official said in February that up to 25,000 Iraqi troops plan to return to Mosul in April or May and, ideally, win it back. This comment came days after al-Abadi told the BBC that while there's still work to do, he felt confident Iraqis could recapture the key northern city. CNN's Arwa Damon, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Jason Hanna and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","ISIS still has some fighters in Tikrit; joint forces are in clearing operations .

The operation to liberate Tikrit, which had been under ISIS rule since June 2014, was aided by U.S.-led airstrikes and involved Iraqi troops fighting alongside Shiite militias backed by Iran. While pockets of resistance remain, Iraqi forces have raised the national flag over the Governorate Building in the city center. The successful campaign in Tikrit paves the way for an even bigger offensive to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which fell to ISIS last year in a major setback. Regaining control of Mosul would deal a significant blow to ISIS's territorial claims of an Islamic caliphate.",0.8600000000000001,"Thoroughly analyze the provided text to comprehend the key information, underlying motivations, and broader implications.

Focus on conveying complete and accurate insights through a clear narrative flow. Structure the summary naturally based on capturing the core essence, rather than enforcing rigid formats. Adapt length and formatting organically to effectively communicate the overall meaning and implications.

Reasoning:
For multi-sentence text summarization tasks like this, the core objectives are:

1) Thorough analysis to extract key points, motivations, and implications from the text
2) Coherent communication of those derived insights through a well-structured narrative

The system prompt guides the crucial up-front reasoning process - comprehending the text deeply by analyzing components and drawing logical connections. This lays the foundation for deriving quality insights.

The user prompt provides high-level framing while allowing flexibility:
- Summarize the ""crucial points"" without over-specifying content types
- Use a ""coherent multi-sentence paragraph"" as a lightweight structural guideline
- ""Focus on conveying complete and accurate insights"" as the core goal 
- ""Clear narrative flow"" is prioritized over strict formatting rules
- Length and structure should ""adapt organically"" based on effectively capturing the text's essence

This balanced approach separates the reasoning phase (guided by the system prompt) from the final summary presentation. It encourages comprehensive analysis and avoids prematurely constraining the model's output format.

No rigid templates or excessive examples are provided, as they could artificially limit the summaries. The prompt allows the model to apply its understanding flexibly while still providing high-level structural guidance aligned with effective multi-sentence summaries.

Their songs of beaches, baggies, boards and bikinis painted a picture of a sun-kissed paradise, and their voices sounded as bright and as laid-back as California itself. This time I was travelling specifically to discover the people and places that inspired the band. I started in Hawthorne where the three Wilson brothers - Brian, Carl and Dennis - were raised, and joined up with guitarist Al Jardine and vocalist Mike Love to form a group. The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers but that didn't stop them tapping into the sun, sea and sand culture of the Golden State . The Wilson family home on 119th Street, where the boys taped their first single Surfin' in 1961, was demolished to make way for Interstate 105. The rest of the street remains though, its neat lawns, porches and fluttering flags reminders of the group's clean-cut All-American origins. A redbrick memorial now stands at the site of the Wilson house, with a bas-relief frieze showing the group carrying a surfboard and a plaque noting that the music conceived here 'broadcast to the world an image of LA as a place of sun, surf and romance'. Hawthorne is indeed a place of sun (263 days a year) but no surf and little romance. It's a charmless city that expanded on the back of the post-war aviation industry (Los Angeles International is only five miles away). I could see why the teenagers of the 1950s would get 'bugged' driving 'up and down the same old strip'. Hawthorne Boulevard, with its low-rise jewellery shops and furniture stores, is no place for the young. The Pizza Show (13344 Hawthorne) added a splash of colour when it arrived in 1956 and became a home from home for the fledgling Beach Boys. Now run by the son of the original owner, it retains its kitsch medieval Italian interior, with wrought iron chandeliers, tiled awnings and mock grilled windows. Surfin' safari: The town of Huntington Beach, where the surf is year round, is known as Surf City USA . Foster's Freeze (11969 Hawthorne), another gathering place, is a blue-roofed fast-food outlet that offers FOOD from one service hatch and ICE CREAM from another. When I arrived Louie Louie, a 1963 hit by The Kingsmen, was playing over speakers in the overhang. This was the very 'hamburger stand' where Brian Wilson saw a girl pull up in her father's Thunderbird and had the inspiration for Fun Fun Fun. Hawthorne High School, around the corner on El Segundo Boulevard, is where the Wilson boys and Jardine attended. The Beach Boys came back to play the 1969 prom and honoured the institution in their song Be True to Your School. The nearest surfing beach to Hawthorne is Manhattan, but the best is Huntington Beach, better known as Surf City USA. Here the sand is soft, the surf is year-round, and the broad beaches stretch for more than eight miles. The broad beaches of Huntington stretch for more than eight miles . Other than Dennis Wilson, The Beach Boys were famously non-surfers, but they were smart enough to observe the burgeoning oceanside culture and knew there was mileage in chronicling it. They mentioned Huntington Beach in Surfin' Safari. The city of Huntington Beach makes much of its surfers. There's a Walk of Fame, a Hall of Fame and a small International Surfing Museum. The sports shops sell everything from boards and wetsuits to sunglasses, caps and jeans. My hotel, the Waterfront Beach Resort had a surfboard in the foyer and doorknob signs that read Wiped Out rather than Do Not Disturb. Huntington Beach is better known as Surf City USA - where the fantastic surf is year-round . It was cold and overcast on my first morning but by 8.30am there were already more than 100 surfer bobbing about in the ocean. From the the pierI could watch them mounting their boards and waiting patiently to ride in on the most powerful of the tall, grey waves. As if on cue, a local surf music tribute band, The Breakaways, dressed in faded blue denims and short-sleeved Hawaiian shirts, began playing at the pier entrance. An even better insight into surf culture and music came a few days later when The Surfaris drummer David Raven took me to an outdoor gig in Irvine, Orange County, where he played with bassist Jay Truax (ex-Nomads), and guitarists Ron Eglit (Dick Dale and his Band) and Paul Johnson (The Bel-Airs). They called themselves The Legends Surf Band. We picked up Johnson from his apartment. He was wearing a baseball cap, blue jeans and sandals and had a black patch over his left eye. On the drive down he told me his story. As a 15-year old schoolboy in 1961 he'd composed a hit tune called Mr Moto for The Bel-Airs. Orange County, just south of LA, has its own strong surf culture such as at Newport Beach . That summer, when playing at the Knights of Columbus Hall in Redondo Beach, a leading surfer came over to him and said: 'Wow, man! Your music sounds just like it feels out on a wave. You should call it surf music.' So he did. When The Beach Boys adopted this sound the hard-core sports crowd initially shunned them. 'As long as they posed as surfers they were resented by those in the true beach culture,' Johnson told me. 'But when they went on to celebrate California youth culture at large by singing about cars and cruising, that broadened their appeal. After that, even surfers appreciated them.' When The Beach Boys started recording their focus shifted from Hawthorne to Hollywood. They signed with Capitol Records, whose 13-storey circular tower at 1750 Vine Street, built in 1956, has become an LA landmark. Legend has it that the architecture was based on the image of a bunch of singles stacked on the spindle of a record player. The night I visited, Arcade Fire were playing a promotional set on a specially built platform outside the tower. The Beach Boys' earliest albums were recorded at Capitol but by the time of Surfer Girl and Little Deuce Coupe, they were also recording around the corner at United and Western (6050 Sunset Boulevard). At the Petersen Automotive Museum there are plenty of cars from the era The Beach Boys celebrated . Now called Ocean Way Studios, this is where they recorded their 2012 comeback album That's Why God Made The Radio. In 1965, Brian Wilson bought the then modern 1448 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills with its great views over the LA basin. It was here that he notoriously built himself a huge sandbox in the living room to stimulate his creative juices. (The video for Sloop John B was filmed in the garden pool.) Two years later he moved to 10452 Bellagio Road in the more upmarket gated community of Bel Air. Several Beach Boys' albums, including Smiley Smile, Wild Honey, 20/20 and Surf's Up, were partially recorded here, while Charles Manson, a fringe figure on the LA music scene in 1969, visited to tape songs that he'd written. In songs such as Little Deuce Coupe, Shut Down, Little Honda, and Fun Fun Fun, The Beach Boys explored the parallel teenage subculture of cruising and hot-rodding. Illegal street racing still takes place but usually in the early hours of the morning, and it's a crime even to be a spectator. In 1967 Brian Wilsonmoved to a more upmarket gated community in the exclusive area of Bel Air . Custom car shows tend to happen out in the desert rather than in the city. But at the Petersen Automotive Museum (6060 Wilshire Boulevard) it's possible to see everything from hot rods and deuce coupes to Thunderbirds and Chevrolets. Spread over two spacious floors, there are plenty of cars from the era The Beach Boys celebrated - a peach-coloured 1957 Lincoln Premiere once owned by Jayne Mansfield, a black 1957 Chrysler, and a wonderful boat-sized 1959 red Cadillac Convertible. The hot rod section has a classic Deuce Coupe customised from a 1932 Ford. Appropriately the museum cafe, Johnny Rockets, is a 50s-style diner with red plastic seating, chrome surfaces and neon signs. On my final day I headed north on the Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu. There's probably no road that better embraces the geographical joys of LA - steep hills and canyons to one side, broad beaches and ocean to the other - and no drive is better suited to a Beach Boys' soundtrack. The group even recorded a song about it in 2012. Beyond Malibu lies Paradise Cove. A left-hand turn took me a mile down a hill to a private beach edged with cliffs where the group was photographed for the cover of 1962's Surfin' Safari, and again two years later for All Summer Long. Paradise Cove is not really a top surf destination despite all the surfboard-shaped signs . Paradise Cove is now home to one of the world's most luxurious trailer parks. Film directors, screenwriters, models and Hollywood actors such as Minnie Driver and Matthew McConaughey have swapped bricks and mortar for transportable homes with a view. A surfboard-shaped sign ironically declared No Surfboards. The warning was somewhat redundant as beaches can be private but the sea is free and, anyway, the waves are so mild that no serious surfer would choose it. Maybe that's why The Beach Boys came here - and why they kept their shirts and jeans on during the shoot.

The Scotland and Lions full-back believes his country are very much perceived as second-class competition south of the border - and his thoughts echo those of skipper Greig Laidlaw who claims ‘England don’t rate Scotland very much’. Both players are bottling up their frustrations for the Calcutta Cup clash, with Hogg hoping to silence the critics with Scotland’s first victory of this year’s RBS Six Nations following defeats to France, Wales and Italy. Stuart Hogg claimed England have 'no respect' for Scottish rugby ahead of Saturday's Twickenham clash . Hogg breaks away to score the opening try during the Six Nations game against Wales in February . Hogg (centre) wants to record Scotland's first win of the tournament against England at Twickenham . ‘The English are a fantastic team but they’re pretty much all about themselves at times,’ Hogg told Sportsmail. ‘They don’t really respect us and we find that pretty frustrating. There will be a certain number of people that do respect us but, no matter how good our performance is, on the whole they don’t. ‘We’re not really in a position to make them respect us when we’re zero wins from three, so for that to happen we need to go down there and shut them up with a great performance and a big win.’ Hogg revealed that his frustrations were exacerbated during Glasgow Warriors’ European Champions Cup ties with Bath earlier this season when the Pro12 side won 37-10 in the first leg at Scotstoun before narrowly losing 20-15 in the reverse fixture at The Rec. Asked to explain his comments about the lack of respect, the 22-year-old Borderer said: ‘There are loads of different things. Take Bath, for instance, in the European games. We pummelled them at home in Glasgow and almost beat them down there, yet their coach never once mentioned us after the games. ‘After they went through, they said they had a tough pool with Toulouse and Montpellier, but never once mentioned us.

Barritt seemed destined for a recall against Scotland, with Luther Burrell unable to train last week, but the 28-year-old limped away from the Ricoh Arena after Wasps fly-half Andy Goode landed heavily on his right leg. Saracens’ director of rugby Mark McCall said: ‘It seems to be his ankle. The knee seems to be okay. I’m sure he’ll be close to selection for England next weekend, so fingers crossed it’s not as bad as it looked.’ If Barritt is fit to play, he is set to rejoin the back line along with Harlequins full-back Mike Brown. Up front, Northampton’s Courtney Lawes is expected to come into the second row in place of George Kruis.","Stuart Hogg wants to record 'a big win' for Scotland against England .

The military is now focused on recovering the helicopter, which searchers found at the bottom of the Santa Rosa Sound near Eglin Air Force Base, and the bodies of all seven Marines and four Louisiana Army National Guard members who were aboard, Air Force Col. Monte Cannon said. Also ahead: Trying to determine why the aircraft went down in thick fog during a training mission Tuesday, Cannon said. ""The decision to suspend is always difficult,"" said Layne Carter, search and rescue mission coordinator of the U.S. Coast Guard. ""With heavy hearts, we have decided to suspend active search and rescue operations. Our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of the members involved in this tragedy."" The bodies of at least two National Guard members were recovered Thursday, and the remains of the other two were believed to be in the underwater wreckage 25 feet below the surface, the Guard said. The troops were with 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion from Hammond, Louisiana, according to a statement from the Louisiana National Guard. The military had previously said that some remains had washed ashore Wednesday. Military officials declined to say Thursday how many bodies still were missing, and they did not release the names of the service members involved in the crash. Two Black Hawk helicopters were training near Eglin in heavy fog when one of them went down in the sound -- a narrow body of water between mainland northern Florida and a barrier island -- about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, the military has said. A couple of military boats already were in the water for safety purposes as part of the exercise, but ""nobody saw anything because of the dense fog,"" said Mark Giuliano, chief of the Eglin Air Force Base's fire department. ""People said they heard a loud bang, and that was it,"" Giuliano said Thursday. The second Black Hawk -- which, like the first, was assigned to the 1-244th Assault Helicopter Battalion based in Hammond, Louisiana -- safely returned to the base, some 40 miles east of Pensacola. ""Whatever the trouble was with the one aircraft, it did not involve the second helicopter that was participating in the exercise,"" Eglin spokesman Andy Bourland said earlier this week. Giuliano said his fire department, which has a unit on Santa Rosa Island near the crash site, was called to help at about 10 p.m. Tuesday, roughly 90 minutes after the crash. The military boats that were part of the mission already had been searching for survivors and wreckage, he said. Investigators from the Army and the Marines will try to determine what caused the wreck, Cannon said Thursday. Military officials have said it's too early to know whether the fog contributed to the crash. The 11 service members, all men, were involved in a seven-day training exercise of amphibious operations, said Capt. Barry Morris, a spokesman for the U.S. Marines Corps Special Operations Command. It involved small boats, and inserting and extracting Marines from the water via helicopter. Morris would not say which phase of the training the Marines were in Tuesday night. The seven Marines were with a Marine Special Operations regiment out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The initial search was hampered by dense fog, to the point that searchers on boats ""could not see,"" Giuliano said. On Wednesday morning, after searchers got a sonar hit, a diver found the bulk of the wreck at the bottom of the sound, Giuliano said. Divers then went into the water ""to start retrieving the aircrew,"" Giuliano said, without specifying how many bodies were recovered. The helicopter had broken into several pieces in a ""high-impact crash,"" he said. The Coast Guard has hired a salvage company from Mobile, Alabama, to take the wreckage from the water, but that company might not arrive until Thursday evening, and weather conditions may delay the recovery until Friday, Giuliano said. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed his condolences on Wednesday. He said the crash was ""a reminder to us that those who serve put themselves at risk, both in training and in combat."" ""We will work with the services to ensure that ... their family members will be well cared for."" A Marine died Wednesday when a T-59 Hawk, an aircraft operated by a civilian contractor, crashed at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona. The aircraft hit a government vehicle, killing the Marine.  The pilot and passenger of the plane were examined and released by emergency services. CNN's John Newsome, Brian Carberry, Victor Blackwell, Jamie Crawford and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Guardsmen aboard were based in Louisiana .

The Bank of England slashed interest rates to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009 at the height of the Great Recession. Almost exactly six years on, figures lay bare the crippling impact low rates have had on prudent households, including many pensioners and hard-working families. The Bank of England (pictured) slashed interest rates to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009 at the height of the Great Recession, which has had a crippling impact on prudent households . Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at savings and investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, which produced the report, said: ‘It’s been a gruelling six years for savers in the UK who have seen the income from their cash obliterated. The future doesn’t look too much rosier either. ‘While interest rate rises may be on the cards next year, when they come they are likely to be small and slow.’ Interest rates were 5 per cent in September 2008 – the month US investment banking giant Lehman Brothers collapsed. But they were cut aggressively as the global financial crisis deepened, before reaching an all-time low of 0.5 per cent on March 5, 2009. Had rates stayed at their September 2008 level, savers would have received £130billion more interest on their nest eggs, Hargreaves Lansdown found. And according to Bank of England figures, the amount of cash held in accounts that pay no interest at all has risen from £47billion to £150billion since the financial crisis struck. Laith Khalaf (pictured), a senior analyst at savings and investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the future 'doesn’t look too much rosier either' However, Mr Khalaf said that without ultra-low interest rates ‘we would almost certainly have been left in a much sorrier state by the financial crisis’. He added: ‘There have also been beneficiaries of low interest rates, most notably borrowers, who have seen their mortgage payments fall substantially.’ Bank of England governor Mark Carney has admitted low rates ‘help debtors at the expense of savers’. The Bank is expected to leave rates at 0.5 per cent again tomorrow, when the monetary policy committee finishes its latest monthly meeting. Mr Carney has suggested that rates could even be cut again – possibly to 0.25 per cent or even closer to zero – if ultra-low inflation persists. But he and other senior Bank officials have also claimed the next move in interest rates will probably be up. It is thought rates could start to rise late this year or early next year, although Mr Carney has insisted increases should be ‘limited and gradual’. Dr Ros Altmann, a government advisor and pensions expert, said the over-65s have been offered ‘a bit of relief’ through so-called pensioner bonds. These offer 2.8 per cent on one-year bonds and 4 per cent over three years. But she added: ‘Anyone younger than 65 is really struggling to make their savings pay.’","Bank of England slashed interest rates to historic 0.5% low in March 2009 .
Report shows crippling impact low rates have had on prudent households .
Amount of cash in accounts paying no interest risen from £47bn to £150bn .

The Bank of England's decision to slash interest rates to a historic low of 0.5% in 2009 amid the financial crisis has deprived savers of an estimated £130 billion in interest payments over the past six years, equating to around £5,000 per UK household. While the low rates helped support borrowers and mitigate the crisis' severity, they have been detrimental to prudent savers, including pensioners and families relying on cash savings. Despite potential modest rate increases on the horizon, analysts warn the outlook for savers remains bleak, with any rises expected to be small and gradual. The crisis also drove a surge in cash held in non-interest-bearing accounts from £47 billion to £150 billion. Though controversial, the ultra-low rates were deemed a necessary evil to stabilize the economy during turbulent times.",0.8600000000000001,"Thoroughly analyze the given text to extract key events, central ideas, important details, and broader implications.

Vincent Tabak was jailed in 2011 after strangling Miss Yeates and dumping her body in the snow on the outskirts of Bristol. Police seized his laptop as part of the investigation into her death and found 145 indecent images of children stored on it. Before admitting to possessing the child pornography, Tabak, 37, protested he would not receive a fair trial because his previous crime was so high profile. Guilty plea: Joanna Yeates's killer Vincent Tabak had admitted four counts of posessing child pornography after images were found on a laptop. He was jailed in 2011 after strangling the 25-year-old and dumping her body in snow . A judge rejected his argument, jailing him for 10 months at Bristol Crown Court, where he was found guilt of murder four years ago. The court heard how the paedophile had stored more than 100 images of children on the computer, with the youngest among them of younger than 10. Flanked by security guards, he held his head in his hands in the dock as the court heard how he had a 'perverse interest in child pornography.' In 2011, at the same court house, Tabak was convicted of killing 25-year-old Joanna Yeates after becoming obsessed with her. The 25-year-old's body was found covered in snow on the outskirts of Bristol . The pair were neighbours, with Miss Yeates living in the groundfloor flat next door to his where, jurors were told, he had watched violent pornography. After spurning his advances Miss Yeates was killed and dumped by the side of the road in Failand on the outskirts of the city. The jury heard how in the months before Jo’s death Tabak had viewed violent porn websites showing women being controlled by men, with images of them bound, gagged and held by the neck and choked. Others showed a woman who looked chillingly like his victim. Miss Yeates's frozen body - which had suffered 43 separate injuries - was found in a similar position to a woman in one pornographic film. In 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service announced they would pursue charges relating to child pornography. His guilty plea today came after a failed attempt by his legal team to have the case thrown out. They claimed he would not face a fair trial in and that he would not be given an additional prison sentence. Dean Armstrong QC, on behalf of Tabak, argued his portrayal in the ITV drama The Lost Honour Of Christopher Jefferies, who was wrongly accused of Miss Yeates's murder, would prevent fairness. Judge Neil Ford QC rejected the argument after telling the court it was not his position to comment on the CPS decision to prosecute. He also discounted the argument that putting Tabak on the Sex Offenders' Register would be pointless as it would have lapsed by the time of his release. Speaking after the sentencing, temporary assistant chief constable Julian Moss of Avon and Somerset Police said prosecution had been 'crucial'. Tabak's legal team argued he would not face a fair trial over the child pornography charges because of his portrayal in an ITV drama about Christopher Jefferies (right) who was wrongly accused of the murder and later successfully sued national newspapers for libel . Following his arrest for the murder of Joanna Yeares, Tabak's former girlfriend told police of his haul of pornography . 'Vincent Tabak is a dangerous, calculating and manipulative offender who is already serving a life sentence for the murder of Joanna Yeates. 'During the course of the investigation into Joanna's murder, indecent images of children were found on Tabak's laptop. These offences did not form part of the initial murder trial. 'Although he's serving a minimum tariff of 20 years' imprisonment, we felt it was crucial Tabak was brought to justice for possessing indecent images of children, so the full nature of Tabak's offending is on record.' Mr Moss said the conviction meant an 'extensive range' of protective measure could be put in place to manage his behaviour and protect those at risk. 'It's possible he may return to the Netherlands following release, so it's crucial the Dutch authorities are aware of the risks he poses,' Mr Moss added. 'This could only have been guaranteed if a relevant conviction relating to a sexual interest in children were secured. 'Joanna's murder was a shocking and terrible crime which had a significant impact on the whole of the Bristol community and I hope this latest conviction will ensure her killer is unable to cause any further harm.'

Discovery: Heritage teams have been renovating a 1930s map room that had been lost under layers of paint and wallpaper at the palace . Royal heritage: The Great Hall of the palace was refurbished in the 1930s, saving what had been the childhood home of Henry VIII . A new interactive visitor guide aims to bring the property to life, with film recreating how a swinging 1930s cocktail party would have looked in the party palace, along with expert views on the restoration of the medieval great hall, stories of the house and games. There is also a children's tour, which explores the animals that lived there - including Mah Jongg, the Courtaulds' pet lemur who had his own heated bedroom, accessed via a pole ladder which gave him the run of the house. Work has also been undertaken to recreate the 1930s garden, which sits among the ruins of the medieval palace. Andrew Hann, English Heritage property historian, said: 'Eltham Palace was the ultimate grand designs project of its day boasting state of the art mod cons including under-floor heating, multi-room sound systems and a centralised vacuum cleaner. It has undergone a series of transformations over the years from a grand hall used by royals to a millionaire's party palace. But the first record of a settlement at Eltham was in the Domesday survey of 1086 which said the manor belonged to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror. It changed hands a number of times until 1295 when Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham, acquired it and rebuilt the manor house before presenting it to the future Edward II in 1305. The King then passed it on to his queen Isabella. Successive monarchs lavished large sums on the palace. In the 1380s Richard II created a walled garden to the south beyond the moat while Henry IV  spent 10 of his 13 Christmases as king at Eltham. Historic: Work has also been undertaken to recreate the property's 1930s garden, which sits among the ruins of the medieval palace . It was a favoured residence of Edward IV who built its great hall and from the 14th to the 16th century it was an important royal palace, often used by monarchs who stayed there for hunting trips in the surrounding parks, according to English Heritage. Henry VIII passed much of his boyhood at Eltham, English Heritage says, and was the last monarch to spend large amounts of money on it. It was at Eltham in 1515 when Cardinal Wolsey took the oath of office of lord chancellor . In the decades that followed, it was poorly maintained and Elizabeth I and the early Stuarts only visited rarely. Over the following two centuries it was used as a farm and a substantial villa was built in the early 19th century. At one point the great hall was being shored up with props and was being used as a barn even in 1903. In 1933 millionaires Stephen and Virginia Courtauld took up a 99 year lease from the Crown. Social circles: Among the guests to have visited Eltham after the Courtaulds took up their lease was composer Igor Stravinsky (left) and actress Gracie Fields (right) They set about building a stylish house that incorporated the great hall which English Heritage calls 'a masterpiece of 20th-century design'. The couple transformed the grounds, which are now a mix of 1930s design and medieval remains. Keen horticulturalists, the Courtaulds also created a variety of garden features including a rock garden, formal rose gardens and a series of garden ‘rooms’, the latter being more typical of the Edwardian period or Arts and Crafts style. According to English Heritage, the building provided enough space for entertaining a broad social circle which included Queen Mary, composer Igor Stravinsky, actress Gracie Fields, conductor Malcolm Sargent, film producers Basil Dean and Michael Balcon, band leader Lew Stone, and politicians including Rab Butler and Leo Amery.

'From April visitors will be whisked back in time to the swinging 1930s when Stephen and Virginia Courtauld entertained the elite of society including composers, artists, politicians, key socialites and even Queen Mary.' Cressida Diez-Finch, English Heritage interpretation manager, said the refurbishment aimed to give people a real sense of what the 1930s palace would have been like.

Before the makeover, 'it was beautiful, but it was very static, so you didn't get the sense of the people and fun and parties, which was really what it was about', she said. 'This is about bringing the whole place to life, re-imagining it and opening it up.' Visitors will also get to see heritage conservation in action, as work continues to uncover restore a recently discovered map-room, whose maps of the world, the UK and London and themed wall paintings have been buried under many layers of paint and wallpaper. English Heritage is appealing for the £35,000 needed for expert conservators to fully restore and protect the room, which gives a glimpse into a bygone age of luxury travel that saw the Courtaulds heading abroad for months each year, often on their yacht.","Eltham Palace and Gardens in south east London is undergoing a major refurbishment led by English Heritage .

Reason logically and objectively to develop a comprehensive understanding by connecting different components. Maintain focus on deriving accurate and complete insights during this reasoning phase.","Based on the following article, summarize the crucial points in a coherent multi-sentence paragraph:

[ARTICLE TEXT]

Example summaries:
- Central event concisely captured: [Example 1-2 sentences highlighting a key event]
- Core idea distilled: [Example 1-2 sentences conveying a central concept]
- Important detail highlighted: [Example 1-2 sentences emphasizing an essential detail]

Prioritize presenting insights from your analysis through a natural, well-structured narrative flow. Convey the text's essence accurately and completely, letting the summary's length and structure emerge organically based on the content's complexity and implications. Maintain separation between free-flowing reasoning and the final summary presentation.

Reasoning:
For text summarization tasks requiring multi-sentence outputs, it is crucial to balance comprehensive reasoning with clear communication of derived insights through a well-structured narrative. 

The SYSTEM_PROMPT guides the foundational reasoning process by:
- Encouraging thorough analysis to extract key components like events, ideas, details and implications
- Applying logical and objective reasoning to connect these components 
- Maintaining focus on deriving accurate and complete insights during this phase

This separates the reasoning process from premature formatting constraints.

The USER_PROMPT provides a lightweight structural frame for the multi-sentence summary output:
- Specifies summarizing ""crucial points"" from the given article 
- Suggests a ""coherent multi-sentence paragraph"" format
- Includes 1-3 concise multi-sentence examples illustrating desired content (events, concepts, details)
- But does not impose strict length limits or rigid templates

By prioritizing a ""natural, well-structured narrative flow"" and allowing the summary's structure to ""emerge organically based on content"", the prompt gives the model flexibility to adapt its output format based on reasoning needs.

The prompt maintains a separation between reasoning (guided by the system prompt) and the final summarized presentation of insights (framed by the examples in the user prompt).

Recent evaluations highlighted a need to reinforce reasoning depth while improving output structure for clarity. This prompt approach aims to address both aspects by:

1) Emphasizing thorough, comprehensive reasoning upfront through the system prompt
2) Providing lightweight structural guidance and examples in the user prompt
3) But ultimately allowing the summary's structure to organically match the content implications

No strict templates are enforced, as overly rigid formatting could undermine the summarization's coherence and completeness. Concise examples clarify the desired content types while the narrative flow instruction guides the output's overall structure.
