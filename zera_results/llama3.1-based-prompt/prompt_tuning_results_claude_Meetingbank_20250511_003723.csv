Getting the Madam Mayor and members of city council. The City of Alameda lacked sufficient housing space for our unhoused residents. Staff recommends that the city use its real estate assets to provide emergency shelter for approximately 32 unhoused residents in three vacant properties located at Alameda Point. Staff invited to organizations, the Bay Area Community Services and Village of Love to submit a proposal to offer emergency housing at three at the three vacant properties. The two organizations were selected based on their depth of experience. Stop interviewing both organizations and found both of them to be capable of offering emergency housing. Staff is recommending Batts to operate the city's emergency housing program based on Box's history operating parable model and their strength of the writing proposal and their high caliber of interview responses. In addition, Batts is highly developed, has a highly developed program model that supports placement of program participants in permanent housing. Batts also has extensive experience successfully providing homeless housing in single family scattered dwellings throughout the Bay Area. Emergency homeless housing programing is designed to promote and support placement in permanent housing. Generally speaking, six months is a typical timeframe for a person to be housed in emergency housing. That period is sometimes more and sometimes less. It is particularly crucial to provide emergency housing prior to the opening of the transitional supportive housing blocks that the services will include one meal a day and food for individual meal preparation, case management, referral services, housing, navigation services, staff oversight and supportive services. That's will also dedicate 300,000 of its annual budget towards flexible funds used to prepare and place residents in permanent housing. Here are staff's recommendations. We're recommending that the City Council adopt a resolution establishing a budget to appropriate $2,836,047 in American rescue funds, ARPA funds to pay for the MAX contract, and 300,000 for startup costs such as furniture , linens, a vehicle and minor remodel and repair and minor, minor remodel and repair 2 to 3 homes. Staff further recommends that city council authorize the city manager to execute a two year agreement with banks for amount not to exceed $2,536,047. Finally, Staff recommends that the City Council authorize the city manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with Alameda County for heat interest funding in an amount ranging from 30000 to 45000 to help support the remodel repairs in these three housing houses. Excuse me. This ends by presentation. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Butler. Do we have any clarifying questions from council before we go to public comment, which I assume we have public comment. We do. We do. Okay. I'm seeing none. Why don't we go to public comment? We only have three speakers so far. The first is Curtis Thomas. Good evening, Speaker Thomas. Speaker Thomas, are you able to unmute? I'm sorry you're. Here. You're great here. Good evening. I'm one of the city's residential tenants in the ranch homes, townhouses and big whites at Alameda Point. While we support assistance for unhoused individuals, it is only. Fair that other neighborhoods in. Alameda and Bay for Island besides ours bear some of the risks and externalities of the city's plan to combat homelessness and housing insecurity. Why are these efforts almost entirely concentrated in our neighborhood? We are already dealing with a large uptick in crime and quality of life issues here on the point, as a result of the city concentrating homeless outreach and permitting encampments in and around us. The proposed three emergency shelters to be installed in homes here housing up to 32, rotating short term adult residents at a time in the very midst of our family oriented neighborhood is cause for concern to myself and many of my neighbors, especially those with children. It would be far more acceptable to the current residents of this family oriented neighborhood of the city, housed families in these units. Instead, I work in affordable housing, and although the majority are well-behaved and deserving tenants, I can tell you that even in the permanent housing stage, there are outsized issues with drugs, violence, theft, psychiatric breakdowns and other unnaturally type behaviors. To place three emergency shelters in two of the big White Houses and one townhouse on top of allowing encampments and concentrating the bulk of the city's homeless. Outreach here is unfair to us since the city is our landlord. We deserve more input into this decision as intimate stakeholders. I ask that the decision be delayed until proper stakeholder input is received. If this is allowed to go through, it would be more than fair for the city to reduce our rents, to compensate us for taking. On a far larger share of the risks. And externalities than any other neighborhood in Alameda. And because reducing rents for the city's own tenants would also align with the spirit of the city's plan to alleviate homelessness and housing insecurity, thus reducing the odds that our tenants, that their own tenants become unhoused. We are the city's own tenants. Please prove that you care about us too. Thank you. Our next speaker. And a back test. Good evening. Speaker bagged his. Evening again here. And members of the City Council, thank you for this opportunity to speak with you about this item, which, as you know, I definitely support. Any. And all options of housing is good for Alameda to really address the issue of homelessness in our city. I see a deliberate on this item to establish an emergency homeless housing program in the city, which I think is long overdue and I hope you will support. I would like to suggest a couple more items to consider. Number one, please hire more staff to run the city's social services and homeless services programs. Having one person, from my experience, to carry out existing programs to now manage some new and major projects in homeless housing. And by the way, this is just one of the many projects this person will be juggling with. It is not sustainable. I want to give a shout out to the community development team who are willing to drop everything to provide support to this position. But they have their own jobs and they also have full time for full work. So other cities similar in size in Alameda has entire teams or divisions dedicated to homelessness services. So please, I urge you to look into staffing services for social services and homeless services. Right. And then second, while I applaud this long overdue effort, this is a temporary solution. So please continue to work on permanent housing solutions for the unhoused. It is estimated that the government spends an average of $35,000 or more per year per person on a chronically homeless person on the streets. In comparison, providing permanent supportive housing costs about $12,800 per year per person on average. So, you know, it's a no brainer, I think, to to really look at a homeless permanent housing solution for the homeless. And finally, I want to thank you. You've always been supportive supportive of projects for our unhoused. And I urge you to continue making ending homelessness a. Priority in the. City of Alameda. So thank you for your time and for your effort in this in this really journey to end homelessness in our city. Thank you. Our next speaker. Stephanie, changed. Good afternoon. Speaker Is it China's hard? Welcome. Thank you. Hello, Kitty. We can hear you just fine. Go right ahead. Thank you. Hello. City Council members Mayor Ashcraft and city staff. I am a resident of the one of the family homes on Alameda Point. And I sent an email earlier today to each of you. And I appreciate that some of you have responded to my concerns about this project. However, I'd like to reiterate and elaborate on some of the points I made. First of all, as the project currently stands, this is not scattered off site housing. This is clustered housing. Alameda Point is a community with mixed housing. We have more than 200 units of permanent supportive housing that is wonderfully managed by the Army two point Collaborative. We have a domestic violence shelter. We have transitional housing trailers, and we have traditional family housing. And in this mix of housing, the we have seen really good outcomes from other residents who need support. The two point neighborhood, however, has become disproportionately burdened by the housing policies of the city. It seems like whenever we have a need for housing, the first the first stop is Alameda point. And I'm sorry. Let me that's okay. The newly formed unhoused encampment over as they have formed over on the estuary has increased foot traffic through the neighborhood. We are taking housing out of the rental inventory at this point. And. Excuse me. I'm sorry. So the plan is actually removing housing as it stands, as in rental, and it is not adding housing. The point is largely comprised of historically disenfranchized populations, and my main concern here is that there has been no community. Input. On this subject. And again, with a neighborhood that has been largely disenfranchized, it seems like this is the one neighborhood who has not been engaged in the process. Oftentimes when we've had other housing issues come up, other neighborhoods have been engaged. And I'm very concerned with the lack of involvement once again with Alameda Point residents. They have seen it. They have seen their voices and heard in a lot of different communities, in a lot of different venues. I think that that's I think the active dismantling of this community is going to further disenfranchize a lot of our residents here and it's going to entrench the segregation policies that are are are cropping up for this. The solution I. I'm going to ask the council to delay the vote on this until we can have some meaningful community dialog and let the voices of Alameda point to be heard. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker. We now have. Reached the limit of being over seven speakers, so the time will now drop to 2 minutes per speaker. Okay. Next speaker is Dee Dee Lewis. Good evening. Speaker Lewis. Hello? Can you hear me? We can. Well. Well, I want to just thank you all for all the hard work you are doing. Providing housing. Housing and dignity, I think, are both human rights. And there is no clear cut path to making that a reality for everyone. I also live on a block of Pearl Harbor, right near one of what we call the big whites that I am reading. What house? 11 kind of a rotating residency of 11 tenants going through various programs to kind of get their get themselves together and be able to find permanent housing. And 11 or a single family home just seems like a lot. If we've learned anything from MTV's The Real World. Even seven strangers living in a house was a whole lot of problems. And 11 just feels like we are not necessarily setting these residents up for success. I would love to see housing insecure families come into this neighborhood. I know through some of my work with AUC, we do have plenty of families that that would be a great fit here. I also was very excited to hear about the bottle parcel and some of that work and I'm hoping we can have some of that continue maybe on Bay Farm as well and kind of share it in this one. I you know, I was hearing a lot of like we're one island, we're one Alameda. And, you know, it's great that we have a lot of those services in our neighborhood, but I think it would be nice to not have all of them in our neighborhood. And I will see the rest of my time. Thank you. Ake you speaker Lewis our next speaker. And by the way, we don't see time. Everybody gets 2 minutes and you use it or not. But thank you. Next speaker. Amy Benjamin. Good evening, speaker. Benjamin. Hi. I too am a resident of Alameda Point, a block away from one of the proposed sites. One of the great things about our neighborhood is that it is a very family oriented neighborhood and it is also affordable housing. One of the reasons that we did move here with our three children was so that we would be able it was one of the only places that we could afford to live. But it's also a childhood that they have out here, much like the eighties, where they can ride around on their bikes and they're barefoot, running from house to house and day and night. And I don't worry about it at all. However, I feel like if we have 11 to 13 people in a single family home directly across the street with a rotating. I don't know with rotating people coming in if they're going to be changing it up every six months because it's emergency housing. It's not permanent housing. These aren't people that are going to be endeared to our community or part of our community per say, because they're not going to be investing in it. I don't feel like I would have that same sense of safety. I don't feel like I would have that same sense of well-being. Having my children just out playing feral and free range. I think that if we had family housing here, that it would be more than welcome refugee housing more than welcome. But to have just people that are coming in for like a moment isn't really necessarily something that feels like it's in line with our community that we have here. And we do have a very strong community, as you can see from the letters that have been pouring in all day. I also would like to say just on a similar note, that the bottle parcel tax is very well thought out. I mean, having Gensler on board, having all of the things put together, having people from that staff here to talk to us was really reassuring and lovely that this doesn't feel like it's as put together. And I would also like to. Have the vote delayed en masse until there can be more discussion. And that's it. All right. Thank you, Speaker Benjamin. Okay. Our next speaker. Craig Mia. There is Mr. Myatt, right. That's correct, Mr. Myers. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. Your council members and mayor. I wanted to say I'm. Redevelopment is near and dear to my heart. I'm a real estate developer and advisor. I was responsible, started revitalizing downtown San Jose, downtown L.A., Albuquerque, and also responsible architecture of the and airport commercial properties. I started development groups of marketing companies, and I've also gone about 100 years of single family housing throughout the Central Valley. I'm also on the board of the East Bay Overland Institute, and I'm also just been nominated as one to the state of Indiana for Project Infant Family Services as well. So I really care about each other and I'm also rivers and it wouldn't be much. Unfortunately, I can't support this venture because it is not fitting with the historical charter. This particular district is called a historical district and the city actually picked a color scheme so that when we change the legacy for this particular historical area and this area was issued for single families and should be preserved because of the policy. Number two, I don't like about this a stream segregation of services. The point I wanted to see that the transit ought to be dispersed around the city. I'd like to see a study done on geospatial mapping illustrating the number of units and location roughly on the Alameda. Third thing I dislike was like a lack of transparency. I just found about this yesterday. And this was like there was no public comment. There's no noticing in the residence. We have no idea who's actually managing the facilities or what's actually happening. I've moved in here because as a fan community, I have a daughter. I like to have my daughter play with neighbors, which should be all the families and kids not loving adults and also living in the big white 11 people is not really nice. I've had family members over and love and time. All right. Thank you. Your time is up. Our next speaker. William Smith. Good evening. Speaker Smith. Good evening, Madam Mayor, and members of the Council. As I mentioned earlier, I've been involved for over three decades with housing in Alameda, and I've really watched how it's become an issue. We could predict predicted, but now that the predictions have come true and regarding the the housing that you're talking about for this item, it's emergency housing . It's not permanent housing. And so it's a contract for two years. So if it doesn't work out at this particular place, it can be revoked. And it's emergency housing. It's needed now. It's needed for people today. And so that means that we will have less consideration about some of the other things regarding concentration at Alameda Point. That is a problem, but it's only three, three housing units. And the place where we will really get after that is coming up later on the agenda. The housing element is affirmatively furthering fair housing and that's where things based. Housing opportunities are spread throughout the island and that's the place to really address that. And three units, 3 to 3 homes, one way or the other is not a major issue on for for reform, firmly furthering for housing. And then the other thing, what you commonly hear, we we're a family neighborhood and we only want families here. Well, that's a that's a common thing I've heard for all three decades. And we have to have places for single people. Many of our own kids grow up. They're not they're not married right away. They need a place to live. They need it. So we need to work in all different kinds of people and all the neighborhoods and integrate them together. So I'm definitely would suggest you go ahead with this, but be sure your staff at absolutely the best do a high quality job because if you don't I would be supportive of the neighborhood and turn and and closing it down in two years when it comes up for renewal. Thank you. Speaker Smith, our next speaker. Dennis Anderson. Good evening, Speaker Anderson. Well, again, I. Okay. I do agree that the island does need to share in the responsibility to help our unhoused neighbors, but not for the reasons that some previous speakers mentioned. Alameda The entirety of Alameda is a family neighborhood. So, you know, I live in the East End. There's families here. There's homes here. Put it here. I don't care. But you know what? I'm hearing a lot of my neighbors on the other end of the island saying is that this, you know, offering services to unhoused people is going to bring in crime and make their kids unsafe. And that's not true. When people are receiving services and are receiving care, they are part of our community and they do have an investment in maintaining that community. So I'm just really disappointed to hear some of the things that I've heard from people. So but yeah, put it put it over here. I don't you know, I'd love to have some new neighbors and, you know, welcome to my community. Thank you. Thank you, Speaker Anderson. And I just want to remind people that you are all entitled to make whatever comments you want to make. We try not to comment or disparage what anyone else said because your your comments, that's your truth and and your perspective. And we we value and learn from all of it. Further comments, Madam Clerk. We have one more speaker, Josh Guyer. Good evening. Speaker Guyer. Good evening. Me being other council members, I also note I want to echo everything that Janice and Bill said. For me, this is it's a it's the emergency housing. It's in an emergency. And so we need to make accommodations. I am sympathetic to people who live in an Alameda point that if it appears in their would be corrected. Thing, that appears that there's a lot of different kinds of services that are concentrated there. As Bill said, we're going to get to that and in. The next item about how to concentrate both opportunity and this amenity across the island, because that's what is required of us by affirmatively furthering fair housing. But I'm sympathetic to that. But I did want to point to one thing that I noticed at least three speakers reference and Bill running up to. The idea that there's a. Family neighborhood in that that there were there would might be people who are unlike. Families who would be in proximity to our families. And that would be. Somehow inherently wrong. I want to just as Bill said, I want to draw attention to the fact that I mean, either either people are inherently have inherent value and they have the inherent right to dignity or they don't. And if and what determines that and if they do, what determines that value is not whether they're a member of a family or not. People have value. People deserve dignity. And there's a lot. Unfortunately, there's a there's a lack of available dignity right now. And we we're trying to make it a little less lacking by providing housing here. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker Guyer And I believe we might have another speaker. They just put their hand down. Sorry. Oh. We don't have another speaker. Okay. With that, I am going to close public comment on item seven A and council. We are going to take a little break because we've already exceeded my two hour zoom rule. And so it's 942 that's come back at 955. Okay. Quick break. Some of us will put in eye drops and look away from your screen for a little bit. 955, we'll see you back here. Thanks, everyone. Counsel, you'll want to mute and probably turn off your cameras. You can just leave and log back in. It's. Hi, John. Good to see you. I think it's best to. It's. Hello? Hello. Hello. Hi, Laura. Okay. So I understand we may have a guest. Yes. Max is here, and I believe they will. People, evil people. Death. Excellent. So Jonathan Russell Apax has joined us. There he is. Welcome. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you? Great. Let me just check in with our city clerk. Madam Clerical studio's count. I've got one, two, three, four, five. Okay. And we've got a city manager. City manager? Hello, city attorney. We've got. Okay, man. Everybody just keeps moving around. So are we. Are you ready to go, Madam Clerk? Yes, we are. All right. Welcome back, everyone. We are back from our break. And so we and we finished our public comment. We are very fortunate to have been joined by Jonathan Russell of Facts, which is Bay Area Community Services. I just want to introduce yourself, Mr. Russell, that will make him available for any council questions or counsel. We could vote to give Mr. Russell 5 minutes to give an overview of his program. And I'm going to assume that you were listening to the previous discussion and could perhaps address some of the concerns. Councilmember Spencer, Jesse, Angela. Yes. I'm happy to make a motion to give him 5 minutes, I guess. Okay. And that's the second by Councilmember Knox, who I. Think. Perfectly had a motion, had a second, maybe. We have a quick roll call vote, please. Rotation. Yes. Or a spencer. I next like. I. She's there somewhere. He is. She's there. She's just juggling. So we can we can skip the. I'm an I, and. I think we've got a majority, so. Yeah, let's. Let's go ahead and start. Thank you. All right, welcome, Mr. Russell. In 5 minutes, tell us everything we need to know. Thank you so much, Madam Mayor. And council members. My name is Jonathan Russell. I'm the chief strategy officer for Bay Area Community Services. Just briefly, I have the five, ten, 15, 30 minute version, so I'll I'll do the five minute max is a we are a nonprofit provider rooted in Alameda County founded in 1953 in Oakland as a group of 12 concerned churches came together and said, we want to provide for the needs of our community long before things like social services existed in any government sector form and really have evolved from that rooted, community based place. We are now a large nonprofit that provides 40 plus programs across the behavioral health spectrum and homeless and housing services in seven counties. Again, most deeply rooted in Alameda County. Here as a chief strategy officer, my job is spending a lot of time on council meetings like this and also working with lovely city staff like Lois and Lisa and Veronica to develop interventions that work and address and end homelessness. And so back as an agency, we provide a lot of homeless services. We serve over 17,000 people a year across all of our programs and housed thousands of people a year across our programs as well. So we are deeply deep believers in a housing first model and a harm reduction model and in a dignified, uplifting and empowering approach to our community experiencing houseless mess. So this program is unique in that it is located in a scattered site, kind of in large home setting, which Backes is also familiar with. We operate about 300 units of scattered site housing in neighborhoods across Alameda County, single family homes, the majority of those permanent housing. But we've also operated an interim way. This interim housing program model is also a model that we've been operating since 2013. Now in eight programs that serve over 800 people a year across those programs all together. Now, now that we have eight and eight different cities, all working with local jurisdictions, all deeply committed to doing not just interim work, but housing that turns into permanent housing. So we've been very fortunate to be able to have 80% on average of the folks served in these interventions, transitioned to permanent housing from interim housing, which, if you know anything about the numbers, is is pretty good. It's so we we we joke that not joke, but we make it clear we don't operate emergency shelter. It's not just about the shelter and rest of it, it's about a housing pathway. So we have had we have housed over 1500 people through this intervention alone since launching these programs that have really grown since 2018. We have an interim housing program in Berkeley and Hayward and Fremont, two in Oakland just to name the Alameda County program. So happy to talk more, understand the community concerns. We are deep believers that it is about seeing our unhoused neighbors as part of our community. And so how can we address everyone's concerns? Work to destigmatize and work to provide the supports we know we need. I do want to just lift up one community member comment that I think is critical for all of us to realize, and the evidence bears it out. When we provide services, we don't bring problems, we alleviate them. When we provide and wraparound folks in our community, we alleviate problems for businesses, not create. And so I do just want to say, you know, these these are complicated issues, but these are our neighbors and these are models that work. And I'm not just saying that because because Max is involved. I'm saying that because I just I appreciate the community's commitment to providing the services. And we deeply believe that the neighborhood is the best place to do so. And so a model, though unique, that is not a big single project that's over there in this industrial park or what have you, which very often, as we all know, sometimes emergency shelters are there is there is value in doing this in a community , in a neighborhood setting. And it's an opportunity for us to wrap around and be a part of that process of transformation and destigmatizing. So that's my that's my impromptu representation. Happy to take any questions or talk more specifically about the service model and anything else there in. Thank you. Mr. Russell, you did a good job of sticking to your 5 minutes. Among the concerns we heard from residents is that some of them are just learning about this. This concept wasn't communicated to them ahead of time. So we can't turn the clock back. But now that we're here and assuming we have the opportunity to move forward, how will backs work with the neighbors? What is your communication model for? For neighbors? Because I think our our speakers raised some very valid concerns. And go ahead, Lisa. Maxwell. Ms.. Maxwell? Yes. I'd like to be a Navy admiral, please. We have scheduled a community meeting to to share ideas and get questions on the 29th of this month at 6 p.m. at the club. We have that space preserved, so we'll send out further information. It's already on the city's website. So that'll be our initial offering. And opportunity to. Engage with the community. We can certainly do that again if folks feel like another would be warranted. I also understand from Mr. Russell and he can. Elaborate on this if you'd like, that once. The. Assuming that we go too far with this program, the community members would have easy access to reach. Out to backs. If something arose that they found to their disliking and wanted to communicate a concern. So there will be a continued line of communication between the service providers and the community members. Maybe Mr. Russell can amplify that. When when was that meeting scheduled? It's on the 29th. Right. But when was it? We just played it together because I wanted to have an opportunity to address concerns. Until we got through this evening, we weren't sure we had a program. So we will move forward with that. Okay. So we will. Well, look forward to hearing more about that. So. Back to Mr. Russell. So Ms.. Maxwell mentioned that Access 24 seven for neighbors who have concerns or questions. Yeah, absolutely. I think probably we again, we believe deeply that this is a community conversation. And so it needs to be a community investment, not that everyone's kicking in, you know, physical dollars do it, but value and commitment to the process. And that comes through conversation. So we definitely want to make ourselves. Available and. Ongoing. If this were to move forward and backs was the operator to ongoing concerns. We do provide 24 hour services for emergencies and for residents. I don't I don't know if I have a 24 hour line for you. I want to talk about this thing at 3 a.m., but definitely will have an avenue in which to ask those questions and be accessible to to make available ourself both individually and in a group space, in a neighborhood meeting space to talk through these things. So I'm not sure I understand you, but if a neighbor I understand from reading the staff report that there will be someone overnight on on these properties. And I assume that someone who is staying awake and overseeing things as opposed to also being asleep. But if a neighbor were concerned about some issue arising, some perceived serious issue arising out of one of these properties. Could they not access someone from Baxter? Who would they call? Are they call community development? Anyone can chime in here on staff. Yeah. I mean, we certainly will have that stuff. And so it could structure it. I'm more bit like, Hey, I want to have a meeting and talk about this and stuff like that. That is, is probably a business hours thing, but definitely we will have staff that is doing 24 hour services on site and I think certainly could make that available through through either reaching out directly to us as a service provider in the midnight hour or of course, if it's an emergency or a crisis or reaching. Out to crisis response as well. But I defer to the city on that. There will be a staff person in each house 24 hours a day. If there is an immediate emergency there, that person could address that. Right. And awake as as bright new risk. Okay. And again, this is a concern coming from a neighbor. Is there a phone number? Is there more to be determined? There will. Be. We can share phone numbers that will cause the that the will allow people access facts. Okay. Emergency concern. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Council members questions. Comments. Councilor SAC. Thank you. I think what was very helpful was the contract that was provided. And I just want to make something clear in the contract on the services that is going to be provided. There's a section called program noncompliance protocols and a basis for a discharge from the facility includes. The first bullet point is possession of weapons. The third bullet point is assault or other violent behavior. The fourth bullet point is theft. The fifth bullet point is destruction of property. So those bullet points when we're talking about a thought, assault and theft. Are we talking about and the destruction of property? How are we talking about that? Does it have to be proven in a court of law? I mean, how is it going to be? And and if the assaults or thefts are against not fellow clients, but against neighbors, how how how is this taken into account? Thank you. Yeah. Great question. So the the. Noncompliance protocol, again, and this is sort of a process we use across all of all of these programs that that do this intervention, that provide these services, of course, as written is relative to events internal to the program that we would then manage the investigation, which would be, you know, bringing all parties to the table in terms of what happened, including witnesses, including staff, including the rest. And if it was determined that there was violence or serious threat of violence, for example, as one of the things you selected, then we would develop a discharge plan in which to find another opportunity quickly and sometimes immediately, depending on the level of risk and the level of need for that individual. So that's kind of an internal to the program, not at the court of law, but certainly at the back senior leadership with all relevant parties giving voice to and doing that internal investigation relative to. I think that we would definitely want to hold the same standard relative to outside that particular home community, the broader neighborhood community. But that would, I think, the determination around if it was something like that, that would need to involve the, you know, the local authorities to the area that they are in the sense that we don't have purview into ourselves over over all of those issues. But we would certainly hold the same standard and the same sort of compliance standard, regardless of who it was impacting in the community in terms of the program or otherwise. Thank you. Hey, other questions, comments, Councilmember Spencer and then Councilmember Knox. Right. Thank you, Mayor. So my first question is, will this house alameda unhoused. It's that 100%. That's the plan. You want to explain why this max time is better? Yes, I'd be happy to. The reason being that we are using ARPA funds and that those funds do not come with a obligation to go through the county's system or to house folks outside of the city. So our priority and our focus will be our own Alameda research. Thank you. Will there be any general fund moneys used for this? ARPA funds are being used for this. No, no, not at this point. Thank you. The community outreach. So I appreciate that. This organization, your organization has been around since 1953 and is community based. Why has there not been any meetings with neighbors to date? Ms.. Maxwell, do you want to take that? I'd be happy to. Yes. We were not sure that we actually had a program to discuss with them. We wanted to make sure that we had city council buy in. And as I mentioned, we've got one scheduled for the 29th, so we can take that feedback. So my concern with that is that's after the vote. So I'm not quite sure how what the point is of reaching out to the neighbors after we have voted on this. This is not I thought we were being asked to vote to approve the program today. We are asking for that. Councilmember Smith Spencer, I apologize if I interrupted you slightly. And during our community. Meetings, my understanding would be we were going to get feedback. And if that allowed us to in any way tweak or modify our program to deal with some of the concerns we could possibly consider those options. There was some suggestion that we could work work in. Okay. So we did hear from members of the community of concerns of having 11 and they may be wrong on the numbers is that 11 people per home. That's correct. It is 10 to 11. We spoke with two potential service providers. They both came up with the exact same number of folks that they would be interested in serving in that environment. They will configure the rooms to be shared. And although this is not considered current, this is not considered to be, you know, dorm style housing. And in fact, Max was permitted to continue operating a comparable program during the pandemic by the county. They do observe protocols for COVID safety, and they do space folks out in rooms. Some of the rooms in these homes are pretty large. So it will just depend on the size of the room. But they also intend to use the living room as a additional sleeping area in order to maximize so we can serve. So my understanding is these houses have three bedrooms. Do any of them have four or five bedrooms? How many bedrooms are in these? The two. What we refer to as the big lights each have four. And then they obviously tend to use the living room. So that provides for that. There's multiple opportunities. There would definitely be a little less amount, less people in the townhome. It just has three bedrooms. Okay. But if it's five, if it's four plus one rooms and we and you're going to house 11 people or ten people believe it's five and four. Excuse me. So is it two people per room, though, or is it sometimes three? It's from typically two, I think there could be a possible occasionally three, but I think two is going to be the preference. The living room, though, is a little larger. So the reason I'm hesitating is I think that may be or the additional person. Could. Potentially be because they could be spaced out adequately and not in that area. Mr. Russell, is there anything you want to add? Yeah, I think that the living room could provide a space where it could actually be it's a very large space about the size of the house I live in right now. And so that could be split up into even two rooms itself. So our goal would be to have appropriate distancing with two to a room. And if that remained, one large single space would be more spacious than some of the individual or smaller groups by having three people. So that would kind of be a let's design it out and see what the best amount of space is potentially for the living room. And then where is the person that is the supervisor? Are they one of the 11 people? So they're not living onsite, they're working three shifts a day. And so the staff are working between and in the home. So there's additional space that goes beyond the living quarters in which both for staff to operate and to be shared space for folks in the dining room, which would be a kind of common living space and an additional space in, in, in the rest of the home. So the onsite staff would be not in anyone's bedroom. They would be operating in the common space. And the majority of the services are community based. So our care coordinators, which are doing the case management, developing the housing plans, would be working with folks in the community as they plan their transitions, and that would be, of course, the services during the daytime hours. Thank you. So we also heard preferences for families, some sort of families. Do you have back? I think there was a speaker who works with the school district. Do you have accommodations for families in any of these homes? I can address that question. Of Maxwell Place. Yeah, we have we heard that concern. Earlier from both the community as well as the council members. And we investigated that little to the extent that we had and we and we spoke to that executive director backs to the extent that we had say three families we could potentially is one of the townhomes for families that's that's not out of the range of possibility . However we also spoke to Operation Dignity non story building as is most familiar with our current unhoused population. And they are of the opinion that based on their experience that we don't really have a great. Number of. Truly unhoused families in Alameda. And the perspective of the school district is slightly different because the mayor can slip into laws and parameters for what constitutes homelessness for difference. That means they could potentially be house service accounts or things that they have a roof. Over their head. But to serve classically homeless, truly unhoused individuals, if we're looking for families that are not terribly many in Alameda, but we can leave that possibility open. Okay. So this will be three homes with each with approximately 11 people living there as individual adults, it sounds like. And I think the three homes are within I'm going to say, I don't know. What is the distance that you think? All three? I think it's about a half a mile. That sounds about right to me. So then I'm going to swing back to what other examples does Backes have of having three homes within a half mile of each other? You 11 individuals each. Mr. Russell going to take that? Yeah. So we operate this interim housing program of varying sizes. We have programs that are currently operating with a census of 25 all the way up to programs that are operating with the census of 160. None of those current programs have the exact configuration that this program would have, though comparable census, comparable room arrangements and what have you. So the the we do not operate the current equivalents in terms of the where these houses sit in the neighborhood. I will say of the current non interim housing scattered site programs that we operate that are permanent housing of which we operate well over 20 homes in Alameda County of permanent housing. Some that have existed, I'm happy to say, since the 1970s and have been continuous operation with folks that are formerly homeless living in those homes do some of those are well within a half mile of each other and some further beyond. And there's a team that works and provides the scattered site services across all of those homes. So it's certainly something you've operated. For decades. Now. Well, before I was on this earth in some of those cases. Thank you. That's all the questions. Well, actually, so there were multiple requests that we delay the item and have the community outreach first. Is there a reason why the decision needs to be made tonight as opposed to after having the community outreach meeting? I would be. Happy to take that one. My. I believe their agency is around the fact that we don't currently have a single mentor for unhoused community members. And we were trying to move expeditiously to create an opportunity to house some of these folks, particularly since we're in the bad weather months. And our goal was to try to roll the houses online and make the available for people to move into probably one after the other one in particular is far closer to being ready and together. It's been a little bit more of a step up. So honestly, the goal, the urgency, and it's just around trying to help as quickly. As we can. So which one is the closest to being ready? Do you know? One of the big whites. And I don't remember the address of it. I don't remember the address either. It's what. One of the two big lies. So I believe it's on Pearl Harbor and I could be wrong. Okay. And then currently the amount of so these and I think these have all been rented recently and have just recently become vacant. So what is the average rents that the city has been receiving for these properties? I believe that the big lights are approximately 20 $800 a month. I calculated the total and it came to around 80,000 a year for the three homes and only the one is currently in a condition ready to be rented. The one on. And it is on Pearl Harbor. Oh, thank you. The other two would need to go through a bit of a tight air before they would be available. Okay. And then we also receive complaints about from people who are current renters in the big lights of those homes have not been maintained that the city has actually done a really poor job of maintaining those homes. And and we heard tonight from a speaker that seems to think that they should get a reduction in their rent of 15%. What does the city seem to think about offering a reduction in rent to those homes? So I just want to double check with the city attorney. Do you have any advice for us on discussing rent reduction? I am assuming the council member is asking this to understand the amount of rent that is being foregone in these opportunities. Is that correct, Councilmember? Yes. I as long as the council member is considering the amount of rent being foregone as part of the analysis, and I think minimal questions in that area probably complies with the Brown Act. So asking about the possibility of reducing current residents rent comes into that scope. I am assuming the council member is trying to understand how much rent revenue is. Rent is at stake for for approving this item. Is that right, Councilmember Spencer? Yes. Well, we heard from a speaker that raised the concern. Also, there have been multiple comments online of the loss of revenue to the city. And how does that then how can we afford this program and other programs? And so my advice would be that, you know, questions would be tailored to how revenues would be lost if this program went forward versus, you know, continuing to rent out the rooms, you know, instead of going forward with the program. I think that would stay within the agenda. If staff doesn't want to question, I'm fine with it. I can ask another. So I'm sorry, Miss MacLeod. Did you want to offer anything? I was just going to share that. The rent range that I just was looking back at my notes is more like 28 to 30 $800 a month. And I have an I understand from my high you are asset management professional that we are somewhat below market currently. And so I know that you know, she would probably have some concerns. I don't put words in her mouth about a further rent reduction, but I know that she doesn't think we're right on mark at this moment. Okay. But earlier I thought the answer is that the city would be losing approximately 80,000 from the rent revenues from these three units. But if it's 20 to 3800 per month, and I think it actually for three units is actually higher than 80,000 lost revenue. And sounds. Like you're. Correct. So does the city know what the last rent was for each of these units? I don't have. That's not my head. I can certainly get that information for you. I think two of them, like I said, haven't been immediately rented. They're sitting for a little bit. And then does the city have any other properties across the island other than. And we heard concerns about that. Could we as a city have housing across the island where it can stop filling when when a property becomes vacant, that then it can decide that it's going to put this housing in it? None that I'm aware of, which is why we were attempting to utilize this opportunity, because it's a rare thing for us to have homes that we already own that could be potentially used for this opportunity. There wasn't really an intention to cluster the things on the West End. It just happens to be where we have assets. So does the city have homes anywhere other than the base? No, we don't. Not to our knowledge. No, not that I'm aware of at all. I don't believe so. Okay. Thank you. I'll just throw in that. The idea of a housing trust that we've talked about. Before. Is something that would allow a city to buy up, say, a foreclosed property or a property for sale at a good rate anywhere in the city and use it for such purposes. Other cities have done this. We don't have a housing trust yet. I think I saw councilwoman actually. Did you have your hand up second and then we'll go to you, Councilmember. Okay, Councilwoman. That's why I didn't think I want to start my start my comments with a discussion I have with the city attorney, which is that I did want to notice that unbeknownst to me, my son announced that Max hired him on Friday afternoon, which we are very happy and proud of. In making that announcement, there are no financial we have to determine there are no financial recusals required. And I'm going to continue in this conversation. But I did want to but I did not need to. I wanted to put that out there just so that it would stick out there in the open. My comments are pretty short. I actually came into this meeting generally having no comments other than that. I think it sounds like a great program that I'm excited to support. I do want to pick up on Councilmember Hirsch Spencer's concerns about the outreach not having been done ahead of time. I will acknowledge that we are pushing staff to move forward as fast as possible to address homelessness and whatnot. And sometimes we drop balls and make mistakes, whether by thinking we'll do it later and whatnot. I'm going to say it just for the neighbors listening. I think this is an effort. This is one where I think we did not do this right. That said, I also think that we can move forward, work with some good neighbor, good neighbor agreements. And I know there's a city meeting set up to kind of discuss what that can look like. And I continue to be supportive of moving this forward. I do also want to say to the conversations, because we've had a number of the conversations about these, you know, where are a lot of these things happening and why do they end up in the West? We have done the city inventory. We discussed it maybe a month ago here at the council, maybe six weeks ago. We also have given direction to staff to start looking more proactively at how we can find sites and make sites available in the future. It will likely take money, but I did want to see it continues to come up as there is a concern among speakers who come. We are aware that right now because of the Navy leaving, we have a lot of available things that we can use that that give us opportunities to move quickly when we have our few quickly years late, when we have a housing crisis and the ARPA money gives us that opportunity. And so, you know, we can be aware that, yes, things are landing maybe a little bit more heavily than we would choose if we had more options on on the West End. But we are also giving our staff direction to really start finding ways to help move things east as well so that, you know, all of our neighbors, our neighborhoods are being provided the services for our unhoused and folks needing support. So thank you very much and thank you for for this work. Oh, you're muted, Mayor. Hello. I'm muted, counselor. I guess you're next. Okay. Continuing on questions again, I think we should focus on the agreement, the contract that we are being asked to enter into. So again, focusing on the services, which is Exhibit A under a site management. There's a bullet point that states bullet point any complaints received from the business community? Including but not limited to the businesses adjacent to the site or in the general vicinity. That bullet point would be a thing that the provider has to immediately notify the city about if there's any complaints. Now, is there any reason why we can't include residents? That bullet point just focuses on business community. So that's a question. I'm only laughing because I emailed that same question. Council member. Good catch again. Same thing. Bullet point provider agrees to immediately notify the city should any of the following a clearer bullet point violence or credible threats against staff or other program clients. Again. What if there is violence or credible threats against residents? Shouldn't the service provider notify the city? Final question, and this is more to the city. Once we get a series of these notices, what then? Okay. Thank you. The first two questions were for the provider. The last question was for the staff. Thank you. Okay. So, Mr. Russell. Do you understand, Mr. Council, everyday folks questions. Yeah. I mean, we'd be. We'd be happy to. To the degree that we have the ability to to sort of determine that community affecting relationship, obviously the presumption, again, thinking internal to our purview within the program or to business, just generally defaulting to those those relationships in which there's an effect on adjacent business. I think we could apply that same principle to whatever the surrounding community is to the degree that we're aware and able to confirm. But even in unconfirmed cases like this has arisen, looks like it needs to be investigated. That investigation would need to include those that have authority relative to the neighborhood. And we would manage and comply from from bringing whatever program related information that we need to bear. So happy to do so. I think that some of that is the boilerplate language that needs to be rightfully modified. And thank you for looking down to the letter of the contract, contract and the staff. Yeah. What do you do with the information? Give me 1/2. Councilor Harry Spencer. Miss Maxwell or Miss Butler. Did you want to? Certainly. I was just going to suggest that as to the contract, if counsel is inclined this evening to give instruction to proceed, we could we could include potentially direction to modify the contract to address those concerns of counsel and based on their excellent concerns. We could also potentially make sure that we have an opportunity for parting ways to the extent that you know, things where we're going poorly with the program and we had an excessive amount of complaints that we could have a conversation about specifically with that look. And it looks like. Just a couple of suggestions for the contract. Thank you. I want to just hear from councilmembers we haven't heard from yet. And I see the vice mayor's hand. Is that the vice mayor of l.a. And then we'll go back to councilmember spencer. And I should ask, though, how some of our days are. You did have the floor. Had you finished all your comments and questions, you were okay. Okay. Back to you guys. Me Mavela. So, you know, I think we've kind of raised a number of questions about what would it cost? And it looks like on the on the upper side of things, it could cost that we would be potentially foregoing around $45,000 a year worth of rent or something like that per unit. But right now, these are three units that are currently not being rented, meaning that we're already forgoing the rental income on these units. And I think, you know, I mean, this is and then my second term on council and I remember during my first term, we had a number of folks that were coming to meetings saying, you've got all these empty houses at only two points. Why can't you use those to, you know, as housing or affordable housing or emergency housing? And now we're trying to do that and we're hearing, no, not there. And I think, you know, I certainly would have liked that we had done that. We had we would have done the outreach ahead of time with the neighbors and those folks that are in the vicinity. I think that that's really important work to do. I would like to see that, you know, I'm glad we have one meeting scheduled. I hope we can also schedule additional meetings if we need to, to allow for opportunities for questions and answers. But I also want to flag the fact that. You know, for years there have been suggestions that we do exactly what we're proposing to do. We just now have the funding to do it, and we also have the open units that are going to be in a place that are suitable and habitable. And I think the other thing is we've sat through meetings where we've asked how many people need emergency housing, and we know that that number is very high and it's growing. We also have asked at other meetings how much we're spending when we have, for instance, an air quality issue, when we when we buy hotel vouchers. And this actually gives us units in the city of Alameda. It gives us beds in the city of Alameda for these emergency needs. And I think that this is so critical and I'm sitting here, I've got the heater on in my house. You know, I've got and we're starting to see the weather change. It's getting colder out. We're seeing we have the with the atmospheric river occurring. This is really an opportunity to make sure that we have those emergency beds available for people who reside in the city of Alameda. I also flagged the similar things in the in the contract. And, you know, I don't necessarily think we have to say that issues raised by residents, but perhaps just we can just keep it general and say neighbors or people within the vicinity. You know, I also want to note that we have in the contract requirements to keep documents, to keep reports that that information should be made available to the city, that those are official records. I mean, there are significant reporting requirements that are that are part of this contract, I think. And, you know, I think our staff perhaps could could make and or create an opportunity for a review if there is some sort of incident that's documented. And you know, I think that there this is really an opportunity where we're kind of I think there's an opportunity for us to really come together as a community around these units. And so, you know, I think that that that I would like to see that happen. I would like to see community buy in. I think these meetings are a good start and really allowing for space for us to have this conversation as a broader community. So I want to put that out there. I understand I know some of the folks, some of my friends live live out there. And so I understand that the issues that they're that are that they are raising. But I also know that these are very compassionate individuals. And if we sit down and speak with them and really engage folks, we can get to a place where where we can we can add these beds and we can do it without delay . So I'm ready to support tonight provided that we set up an opportunity for that community input and not just limited to the one meeting and that we make some some tweaks to the the contract being proposed. Thank you both very well. I can't, however, decide. Two questions. First question is, is there any reason why we can't move ahead with one of the three in the first year and judge its performance, then move with the second and third? If, if, if? Is there any reason why we can't do that? Question. I a miss Maxwell. I would ask if Mr. Russell could assist with that, because I have some concerns that the economy is a scale, one that would make one home operation of one home of interest backs. I question that, and I don't know the answer to it. Yeah. I think we I think we would just need to look at what that what that would look like operationally in terms of the economies of scale, sort of to to invest the infrastructure to operate the project. It certainly is the volume that creates, I think, the the efficiencies, the economic efficiencies and which is to say nothing of the sort of community impact relative to the need. But that's it. That's of course a separate determination. So I think that would be looking at the at the ability there to do so and then what the what the cost difference would be in that. I think there would be just from, you know, as any business model small you have you have an inherent staff that you have to have no matter how big it is. And then you you scale up incrementally from there in some cases. So it would just be looking at the cost structure and the impact. And I think but we're happy to have whatever conversation that the council would direct with city staff if. There was determination along those lines and. See what that looks like. Thank you, Mr. Russell. A second question. The second question for staff is, could we actually put together language that kind of says, you know, all these notifications that we're getting relative to what I just referenced, those sets of bullet points, you know, what is the could we actually put language tonight that says what is the level, the threshold level at which we would have to make some serious decisions in terms of go, no go or or does that have to take some more time? I would suspect it has to take some more time to put together. But that's a question for staff, legal staff or program staff. I believe. I mean, I don't know that we can do it on the fly, this thing. I think it's a very doable request. I think we could come up with language that gave us the opportunity to make an election. The program wasn't working in this location to the extent we had a, you know, an agreed upon amount of material problems. But I think we'd have to craft language, and that would certainly be the assistance of Mr. Sharon's office. Okay. I know. I see the vice mayors had it, but Councilmember Harry Spencer's had her hand up for a while. So let me take you first, Councilmember Harry Spencer, and then we'll go to. The vice mayor. Thank you. So I did want to follow the members of the contract language. And just at the beginning and it's towards the end of the contract has what the noncompliance protocols are. But for those that are listening on TV, I want to say it says only the following reasons may be used as a basis for discharge from a facility. And the first one is possession of a weapon at the facility as opposed to possession of a weapon, not at the facility. And it continues similar to that possession of illegal drugs on the premises. However, apparently possession of illegal drugs not on the premises is not you may not be removed from the facility for that. So I think it is important that, in fact, I agree with I, I believe I've heard at least from a couple of council members that this contract provides that outside of the facility, we also would not want people having possession of a weapon, possession of illegal drugs, assault or violent behavior, theft, etc.. So I think that contract should be modified before or before we approve this item. I also do think it's important to have the meeting prior to agreeing to this and having community input. I think that the rents could actually be higher than what staff has provided tonight, and I think that these homes, at least one of them has been rented very recently and is just not. The city has not rented it out and is holding it here. But I would make a motion that we delay this decision until the next council meeting, which is immediately after the meeting with the public, which is is it's not that far away. It's already December, I believe the date is December six, which is then following the community outreach meeting. And at that time, I think this contract could be sorted out. I think the and and I don't think it is at all appropriate to proceed without the community outreach first. I think it's unfortunate that this has been brought to us without that. I really in regards to staff's comments that we didn't know we were going to have the project or not, so we didn't meet with the public in advance moving forward. And I think it's always important to reach out to them first before it comes here so that then we they get to be part of the process. They get to have their questions answered in advance. And it doesn't really put us in this position of hearing from so many people that they felt like they were excluded from the process. So I do move that. We bring this item back at the first next council meeting. Outreach. Yeah. So we have had a motion to continue this item or bring it back in December. Do we have a second? I'll second. It was comment. Mm hmm. But I could I could wait to comment because I think Vice Mayor Vella wanted a question questionnaire. Well, we're going to have a if we don't have a second, we're going to move on. Okay. Discussion. Do we have discussion or should we just take a vote? Okay. Discussion. Councilmember Desai. My discussion is this. I think that this is a project that we can all be very, very proud of. I think 11 per unit is a little too high. But but to the extent that we tighten the contract, I'm willing to do it. I'm willing to try. We are in that housing crisis. But but I agree with Councilmember Herrera and that maybe we should kind of, you know, as they say in sewing measure twice before we cut once. So I think maybe a delay until next council meeting would be in order to deal with kind of the range of issues , contractual issues that we waste on. So that's why I'm sticking. Okay. Any further discussion? Let's have a roll call. Madam Vice Mayor, please. You. So, you know, I think this this point is not necessary, hasn't necessarily been highlighted enough. But we have over 200 individuals as of our last point in time count that do not have housing in the city of Alameda. That is 200 people that are being forced to sleep and shelter outdoors that we are we are saying, you know what, we need to we're going to go ahead and wait. Even though we identified in our five year strategic plan just a month ago, we reiterated and passed that plan and we said this is a priority. And so I just think we are saying these things from the safety and security and warmth of our own homes or our city. You know, all of us are housed and have housing here in Alameda. And I just I yes, I think it's important that we have these conversations with the neighbors. I think that we need to make sure that we have a contract. I do not want to delay this. And so that's why I'm not going to be supporting this motion tonight. Okay. If I could stop you, because we're going to have to take now. We'll get back to you, Vice Mayor. We've got to we've got to do a quick roll call vote here, and then we have to do a housekeeping vote because it's coming on 11:00, believe it or not. Okay. We've had a motion. We've had a second. I'm sure there's no more discussion because we need to take a quick roll call vote. And Madam Clerk. So I. Am. I said, sir. Hi. Max. Right now. Avella. Now. Mayor, as you. Know. The motion fails 2 to 3. Thank you. Okay, Council what? We have to decide and we got to do it quickly because at 11:00 we all turned into pumpkins. But we've got to. So whoever said we were going to get through this whole calendar, I yes, you're right. But what we might well say, we've got these items remaining. We've got the housing element is seven B, the general plan is seven C and parking management is seven D. Who wants to make a motion councilmember? Not quite. Well. So I'm going to preface this with I would like us to consider putting we have a fifth to Tuesday between now and the seventh. This the seventh is going to be vision zero and a whole bunch other stuff. We there is no way we are getting through the work. So what I'd like to I will make a motion now for, for this part of the calendar, but I'm really hoping we can consider calling a special meeting on one of the two Tuesdays between now and the seventh or another day. To hear the rest of this agenda. I would like to move that. We hear item seven, which I think is probably one of the shorter items. I do not think we have time to even begin talking about the housing element or the general plan tonight at 1051 and any of the referrals that are remaining as long as we end before midnight and with the idea of moving the rest of the items to a special meeting. But we could hear regular items and go up to midnight. Is that what you're saying here? Seven D and then the and then the in any outs any referrals that that got we just got out of the way that we could that that that fit in the end there's only going to be 15 minutes or something by the time we get done with all this. I don't think we're moving too fast on this stuff. Well, I am. Okay. I'm not going to support moving to referrals tonight, but you have made your motion. Do we have a second? Was that you, Councilmember de SAC? A second was a quick comment. My quick comment is I agree that the housing element and general plan should be a special meeting. I think most cities do it that way. That's my second. I don't disagree. I think we're going to have a hard time around the Thanksgiving holiday because key staff incentives, council members may be out of town. Myself included. So we. Could try. Okay. However, we need to, we need to take a vote. Okay. So. So Councilmember Cox why made a motion council Desai his seconded it. Let's take a roll call vote. I'm sorry. We have a discussion cast over here, Spencer. Thank you. Just real quick, I will not be supporting this. I would rather just continue and at least start the draft housing element so that we could. We start towards that. Thanks. Okay. Vice Mayor Vella. I'd be supportive of finding a way to add a meeting in between now and the next meeting for the housing element. But it couldn't be on a Tuesday because we wouldn't be able to have everyone we need. That's my. Point, but I'm happy to try to see if we can find a day. I'm not saying necessarily necessarily a Tuesday, but we will. We could ask for OC. We have a motion before us. Councilmember Knox. Right. Okay. We need four to have already said they are not going to support it. So I'm going to withdraw my motion and make the following motion that we were and we finished this item. We direct staff to find a time that works for the most council members possible between now and the seventh to hold a special meeting . And I want to be really clear in my language that I am saying that most council members like this is if somebody has to miss the meeting or whatever, then it has to. If has to be me, it has to be me. But we've got to get our work done and I feel like it's because. We only have a few minutes before this is all going to be moot. So may I say something? Sorry. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Yes? I'm so sorry to interrupt, but you would need to identify that date and continue these items to that date, specifically tonight, because we don't have time to notice another meeting. So you would have to the date would have to be set as part of the vote. Sorry. Your muted Catherine's just a presence question we only need to make the decision before 11:00 to hear new items. Can we not get to figure out the date after 11:00? Yes. For a continuation. Yes, you can do that after 11:00. But I'm sorry. I just wanted to make sure it was clean. It's good to make sure. Gives us a little bit more time and breathing in whenever it's up. To you and to contemplate the motioned Councilmember Harry Spencer was suggesting. I don't see a value in starting a conversation on the housing element and then stopping and then at some random time in the future, having public comment come in. I, I just that you're going to have different people there, etc.. It's late. I don't. Should be a special meeting. We're going to have half a few people are going to comment. Okay. Okay. I'm going to limit the editorial comment just because we've got to get something that four people agree on or when it hits 11:00, we just finish this item. Is that correct, Madam Clerk? Right. To finish this item. And then you can do that. City Manager Communications. All communications. And telecommunications. Okay. So in 4 minutes remaining, does anyone want to try to offer a motion? Vice Mayor of L.A. You're pretty good at that sort of thing. Or council rehearsed better. Perhaps the two of you. Quickly. I wanted to make a motion that we could just continue until midnight and start with this. The next item. Which is the housing element. It's a draft, and I think we need to start it. So people can we start thinking about our feedback and where the staff is? Okay. Anybody anywhere? Councilmember Vela Well, everyone, a second or a tweak or something. Quickly. Vice mayor, any thoughts? I would prefer that we just continue that item, the housing element item. I my preference isn't to start it. And would you continue it to that item six on the next semester? Yes. Okay. Is that emotion so moved? Okay. Do we have a second counselor and not quite chime in? How can we make this better? I think that's going to be a multi-hour conversation with Vision Zero and everything else. We just put three other items before everything like. We got it. Can we? Okay. So can we, can we continue it to a special meeting or. We have to we have to take the date tonight. I have to pick the date. Or we can look we could agree to take one more item after this. And then after that we can discuss the date. Is that correct, Madam Clerk? But we've got to make a decision about what to. Do after the. 11:00 vote is just if you want to have a new item after 11. Correct. How about we take that parking item after about 70? How about we start with item seven? I'll make that motion. Okay. After this. Okay. Do we have a second? I'll second that. Okay, so let's have a roll call vote. Does everyone understand we're making a motion to continue this item and then take seven D and then we'll look at dates. Okay. Mm hmm. Um, so I'm ready to proceed, sir. No. Not quite. I. I i. As the. Ashcraft I that. Carries by 4 to 1. Oh. With 2 minutes to spare. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Where were we? Who did I cut off? Was it. Is it you, Madam Vice Mayor? I think. I think the last motion failed. And so we were going to. Perhaps make an emotion. Well, no, we're we're. We're moving we're moving forward. We just passed that motion. We had four votes. We're going to hear more than 70. But you're talking about this item, the seven a? Yes. So my I was just making the point about the the the fact that we have over 200 unhoused individuals. That number has continued to grow in double digit percentages year over year. And we're in winter months. We know that there's weather events and everything else happening. And, you know, this is economy of scale, but at the same time, it's phasing it in. We're not we're not opening up all of these units. So I would like to move support of this with a direction to staff. And I know, Madam Mayor, you still have to give your comments. As I've just like. But yeah, you go ahead, make them. I'd at least like to get a motion on, on the table with, with, you know, with the comments around the contracting language being change, because I think that that needs to there needs to be some amendments there and then also that there be direction to have more than one community meeting, because I do think that that that will be needed. Okay. Thank you, Councilmember Desai. I will second that motion and I will offer a comment. Shall I offer comment? I will wait for you, Madumere. You better wait for me. I will wait. If you want to stay on my good side. No, I appreciate everybody's comments and. And staff. And I appreciate Backes getting here in a hurry. Thank you. This is what I think. And I have had the privilege of visiting a site that backs Rand. And I've also talked with the mayors of Brooklyn, the mayor, the mayor, Brooklyn's one mayor, the mayors of Brooklyn and Oakland, about the incredible success they've had with backs at housing sites that that are run as co-housing in different neighborhoods where they've been able to buy up housing and and rehab it and it it's worked really well and the value of using an organization like Bax and congratulations Councilwoman Oxlade and your son working for them is they they have the track record. I didn't know how far back it went, but I know how extensive, especially in the housing crisis it has been. And and I just have to a really quick aside, when we visited the navigation center in Berkeley, which isn't this at all, it's like two dormitory style. One is for men, one is for women. There's, you know, bathrooms, communal bathrooms for men and women and a garden and all that. But talking to the residents there. There was a fellow we talked to who was a professor at Cal who had, you know, fallen on hard times, had an illness, ended up homeless, and yet this was, you know, getting him back on his feet. It's just there are so many ways that people become homeless. But I agree with everything that has been said about it would have been preferable to do the communication piece ahead of time. I also want to remind us that we stretch our minimal staff pretty thin. And so they this this I mean, there are only so many hours in a day to do these things. It's not a reason to delay this project because, as has been noted, we have a housing crisis. It's been a long time coming, you know, waiting to do something like this. And so I think that knowing that we're working with back at a trusted and experienced provider gives me a lot of confidence. However, what we also learned from doing these field trips in San Jose and Mountain View is it is critical to have good communication with the neighbors, to have a team, to have an advisory committee. The neighbors deserve to not only feel that they're being heard to be heard. And I fully expect them to be open minded and to allow themselves to be persuaded to learn more. But that road goes both ways. So communication is key. We're a little late starting, but we'll catch up. We'll get there. I'm confident that staff and personnel are capable of doing that. I did hear some neighbors talk about encampments in the area. I haven't this week been out to the area, but staff I do expect staff to be on top of that. I am really pleased that the day center is now open overnight. I just ran into Joey Harrison, who who runs a facility last night at an event. And he was so excited to tell me that two individuals who'd been previously sleeping out in public somewhere, they had eventually persuaded them to come. And they're sleeping overnight there and they come and go during the day. And it's made a huge difference. So please, let's go out and reach out to the folks in these encampments, get them connected with Village of Love. And, you know, maybe we can even get them into some of these programs because they you know, the neighbors raised this. And it's a concern. And we don't want people sleeping in encampments. We want them sleeping sheltered. And the other thing I just want to throw out, it's an idea that I learned about from the League of California Cities webinar on addressing homelessness or homelessness solutions. The City of Riverside has a expansive homelessness outreach program, and one of the things they've done is they've created a registry almost like if there is someone's getting married and they have a registry or, you know, something, having a baby. But what it is, the whoever they contract with has a wish list of the things they need to furnish these various units and they put them up there. It's it can go through Lowe's or whoever, you know, printed these sort of things. And community members can go on to the site and buy these furnishings and furnish these sites. It's just a way to promote community awareness and also a little buy in to a very, very valid program. The the only thing that I would add, other than what's been said about making sure that there's also a mechanism for dealing not only with businesses in the area, because really there's more residences in the area in any problems they might be having with the residents of these homes. But is also I do not support using funds, ARPA funds to buy a car for this program. When I asked the question of staff why a car? And they said, well, you know, some time back staff would drive it because sometimes people need to go to a doctor's appointment or to the DMV. That's fine, but we don't need to buy a car. We can contract with a local taxi company for taxi vouchers or something, but a car, the city using RPA funds to buy a car. And the insurance issues we don't usually are not in the business of transferring people. So I would respectfully ask that the purchase of a vehicle not be included if at some point it just becomes indispensable. But buying a car to go to occasional appointments doesn't seem like the best use of these dollars. I'd like them to go further. So anyway, I am. I'm really excited about moving this forward. I also have. Said to staff that to the extent that there are families available and families couch surfing, in my mind, maybe there's some legal reason they can't use it. But these are homes with yards of backyards and places for kids to run around and there could definitely be a co-housing model. I think that's possible. So just keep that in mind just because I think it's a lovely opportunity. So I am ready to go full speed ahead on this. Councilmember Dysart, back to you. Thank you. You know, if I can just speak to the residents who live in the surrounding areas, I certainly hear the concerns that you have raised. And so I think to the extent possible, try to scrutinize the contract that we we have before us. And I do believe that I found some shortcomings in there. And I think I have to trust our staff, both our city manager and his staff and our city attorney and and his staff, that they've listened to the concerns that not just me, but everyone else on council has raised, and that we will strengthen the contract that's before us. I do think that this is a rare opportunity to quickly address the homeless crisis that we're having, not just in the in our area, but in our city itself. And so, again, with the arc of funds that we have available, we can do something that we had never we had not been able to do before . But I think you're right, though. I think the the contract has to be strengthened, because I think there are some areas in there that seem to be obvious in terms of like making sure that we contractually include the concerns of residents along the lines that we had discussed earlier. So that's why I'm going to support this. And, you know, I think in the end, Alameda point, especially the big white area, I think as a city, we'll all be better for it to have a mixed community that that we're we've been contemplating for Alameda point not just the big whites area but also around city and other places. Thank you. Councilmember Desai. Councilmember Harris Spencer. Thank you, Mayor. So I will not be supporting this. I think that it's truly unfortunate that we're not doing the public outreach in advance prior to this. I also do think that the community has been asked to. I think it really is already a mixed use community. And I think that we I think that they raised legitimate concerns, but I think that they absolutely needed to be involved in the conversation before this came to us. Thank you. Thank you. And Madam Vice Mayor, just want to restate that motion, please. I had moved too to move forward with with this with the comments relative to addressing the contract as proposed from the council and then also requiring that there be more than more community engagement meetings so that there can be responsiveness to the community concerns raised. Madam Chair, I don't think your your request to remove the funding for the car. That's fine with me. I don't know if I need to amend the motion, but I don't have a problem with that. Thank you. I would appreciate if you would. Okay. And so Viceroy Villa made the motion she submitted in council every day. So you certainly didn't. You? Okay. Thank you. Okay. May we have a roll call vote, please. And so every day shock. Over Spencer. No knocks like. High. Rella high. As the Ashcraft. High that. Carries 4 to 1. Thank you all. Thank you, staff for putting this together. Thank you, Mr. Russell. Thank you to the neighbors for all your insightful comments. We heard you, and we will heed you. And we will be looking forward to hearing from you more and incorporating your thoughts and comments. So this is an important first step, big step forward. Yet another one tonight. So. Okay, everyone go forth and do good work. Thank you so much. All right. We are going to quickly change. Gears. And move to item seven D. Madam Clerk, while we're changing the scenery, could you please introduce this item for us? A recommendation to reorganize the city's parking management program and parking fund and adoption of related resolutions.","Recommendation to Authorize the City Manager to Execute an Agreement in an Amount not to Exceed $2,536,047 with Bay Area Community Services for Emergency Homeless Housing Services for Up to Two Years; and Recommendation to Authorize the City Manager to Negotiate and Execute an Agreement with Alameda County in an Amount Ranging from $30,000 to $45,000 in Homeless Emergency Aid Program Interest Funds to Assist with Remodel/Repair of City-Owned Housing for Use as Emergency Homeless Housing; and Adoption of Resolution Establishing a Budget to Appropriate $2,836,047 in 2021 American Rescue Plan Act Funds (C99300) to Receive Contractual Services from Bay Area Community Services and Funds to Remodel/Repair and Provide Fixtures, Furniture, Equipment, a Vehicle, and Supplies for the Emergency Housing. (Community Development 10061833)","Based on the City Council discussion, here are a few key points:

- The Council approved moving forward with contracting with Bay Area Community Services (BACS) to operate an emergency homeless housing program using 3 vacant city-owned homes in Alameda Point. 

- There were concerns raised by some Alameda Point residents about concentrating these services in their neighborhood without adequate community outreach beforehand. 

- The Council directed staff to strengthen the contract language regarding notifying the city about issues impacting neighbors (not just businesses), as well as criteria for removing participants who violate rules around weapons, drugs, assault, theft, etc. whether on or off the premises.

- Additional community meetings will be required beyond the one already scheduled for December 29th to allow more opportunity for resident input.

- Funding approved includes $2.8 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds for the 2-year BACS contract and $300,000 for startup/repair costs, but excludes purchasing a vehicle.

- The motion passed 4-1, with the Council acknowledging the urgency to provide emergency housing options during winter months despite the community outreach misstep.

In summary, the emergency housing program was approved with direction to improve communication with neighbors and clarify operational policies through stronger contract terms.

My name is Rochelle Wheeler. I'm the bicycle and pedestrian coordinator for the city in the Base Reuse and Transportation Planning Department. I'm happy to provide a brief staff report, and I'm also happy just to answer any questions you have. All right. This item was pulled by. And Nebraska. Nebraska. Thank you. Sorry, my iPad is freezing, but I think it's in Frozen now. Thank you, Miss Wheeler. I have just a couple of questions. So and as you know, I emailed them to you earlier today because I don't like to blindside staff. So the one of them is. So we're talking about the cross Alameda Trail and this particular segment called The Atlantic Gap. And do you want to just tell the audience listening where that is so they can kind of get a frame of reference? Sure. The cross helped me to trail. Atlantic Gap is one block, but along Atlantic between Webster and Constitution and it's a key connector between a off street multi-use trail that will go through the Jean Sweeney Park, the cross, I mean, a trail. And then the part that will go to the west along Ralph, out Bazardo. And so for laypeople like me, if you needed a landmark, does everybody know where the Starbucks is at Webster Square. And then, you know where one of our very nice affordable housing complexes for seniors Independence Plaza is? It's that segment of Atlantic. And it has it's been challenging for pedestrians, let alone bicyclists. Do you want to just explain briefly why that is? Essentially right there, there there are no bicycle facilities along the street. It's fairly narrow, unlike the portions of the the future trail to either side where we have a very wide public right of way to work with. We don't have any extra right of way there. So it's it's a challenge. Thank you. So I was pleased to read in the staff report that in early 2016, after further discussions with Bike Walk Alameda, more extensive improvement options were considered to create a protected bikeway along the Kat stands for Cross Alameda Trail at the Atlantic Gap. So the city I understand, is currently working with these engineers BCP to develop a final design for this segment, which is a separate project which will come to the Transportation Commission in early 2017. Is that correct? That's correct. The design. Well, yes, design well. And so my question is, what is the funding source for this portion of the the Cat, the Atlantic Gap portion of the Cross Alameda Trail? So the funding for that portion is most likely going to be from a combination of measure B, B funds development impact fees and or possibly Transportation Development Act Article three fees. And we're still figuring out the exact combination of those sources. And as we get a final, we're still waiting on the final cost estimate for that. Well, that was my next question, because we don't know exactly what the final plan is going to be. We don't have the cost. But do we have some guarantee that whatever it is will be fully funded? That's our intention, is to fully fund it. We're also looking at designing a project that is lower cost so that we will definitely be able to fund it. And so I and I, I am a cyclist and I've talked to a lot of cycling advocates when I understand the need for something that fits into a budget. But I don't think I mean, we're hoping that it's more than just paint on the pavement. Oh, definitely. Well, definitely. We're looking at a two way separated bike lane along that facility and then making some very strong improvements to both of those major intersections to make sure that bicyclists and pedestrians can safely cross there and connect to the the facilities on either either end. So crosswalks on either end of that's a fairly large block, right? Fairly long. It's a medium sized block. I guess the one of the challenges we've faced is that the residents coming from Independence Plaza tend to. Cross in the middle of the of that block because maybe it seems long to them. Is there. Are we addressing that? Yes, we're definitely including a mid-block crossing and our proposal for that for that one block because of those frequent mid-block crossings that are happening by the seniors right now. Okay. That that's great to hear. Thank you. And so then my last question is from the staff report on page three. So one of the items that we're asking these engineers to provide to do is to provide construction support, which is a necessary task for a large project of this size, anticipated to cost over $3 million to construct. Can you tell us what providing construction support means? Yeah, sure. So Bcf would be the engineer on record as the primary designer of this and this contract support allows us to have them available during the bidding construction bidding process to be able to answer any questions that come up in order to make sure that the bids that we get are realistic and based on the accurate accurately, based on what we'd like to do. It also makes them available as needed to answer questions during the construction process or phase, which helps avoid change orders, project delays and confusion in the field. This is a very standard type of service. It's being used for other city, large city construction projects and it's all as needed and I'm kind of more of an as needed basis. Okay. But the they'll be essentially on call. Yeah. During the bid process. Great. And my last question then is also from page three and this is paragraph three on the staff report says providing signal plans at Atlantic and Webster and Atlantic and Constitution. And those are the two crosswalks on either side of this block. The Atlantic Gap we've been talking about if changes are needed to these. Signals to create safe bicycle and pedestrian crossings. What what does that mean? So in order to make adequate space for the crossings, we may have to physically move some of these traffic poles. We may also have to alter them, such as to add a protected left turn phase again, all with the intention of making those crossings as safe as they can be for bicyclists and pedestrians. You have answered my all my questions and you've done a great job doing it. Thank you so much. Thank you. And the other council members. So with that, I would I think we already have a motion. Okay. And I will. Second, thank you. All those in favor of my motion carries. Thank you. And now to E and Amber. Already, I think I pulled out one. Recommendation to amend the contract with clean lakes to increase the contract amount by 99,000, including contingencies for vegetation management.","Recommendation to Award a Contract in the Amount of $179,444, Including Contingency, to BKF Engineers to Finalize the Design of the Ralph Appezzato Memorial Parkway and Atlantic Gap Segments of the Cross Alameda Trail (Between Main Street and Constitution Way).  (Transportation Planning 9161102)","Based on the detailed discussion, it seems this was a staff report and City Council meeting regarding plans and funding for improving bicycle and pedestrian facilities along a one-block segment called the ""Atlantic Gap"" that is part of the larger Cross Alameda Trail project. 

The key points covered:

- The Atlantic Gap segment along Atlantic Street between Webster and Constitution has been challenging for cyclists and pedestrians due to the narrow roadway and lack of dedicated facilities.

- The city is working with engineers to design a protected two-way separated bike lane and improved crosswalks/signals at the intersections for this gap segment.

- Funding sources being considered include Measure B, development impact fees, and Transportation Development Act funds.

- The goal is to fully fund the project, likely over $3 million, with a design that fits the budget while providing more than just paint on the pavement.

- The design will include a mid-block crossing to accommodate seniors crossing mid-block from the nearby Independence Plaza housing.

- Construction support from the engineers is included to assist during bidding and construction to avoid delays/changes.

- Signal modifications may be needed at the Webster and Constitution intersections to create safe crossings.

The key points are:

- The city clerk filed item 314458, which was the auditor's request for an extension to file the reports.

- Council member Peterson provided a brief explanation that it was a routine request from the auditor for more time to complete the required reports on those surveillance technologies.

- After allowing comments, the council voted 9-0 to approve and file the clerk's item 314458, granting the auditor's request for an extension.

- They then moved on to agenda item 7, with the clerk being asked to read that item into the record.

It was a fairly procedural council agenda item approving a request from the auditor's office regarding reporting requirements on certain police/transportation surveillance technologies.

It just goes to show how much support we have behind our efforts. Yeah. Oh, and this is day. Is. This is forward planning. So as you know, our association is a member of Sister City International. All right. Oh, thank. You. And what we do is we facilitate the. We facilitate and organize sister city activities for the city of Alameda. We have actually been a nonprofit organization for the last five years as well, so it helps for our mission. And our mission statement is as such. It is our goal to create relationships based on cultural, educational, economic and informational exchanges that foster lifelong relationships, to provide prosperity and peace through person to person diplomacy. Moving forward as president, I envision adding several community. Chairs. To head their own community. Scuse me. Had their own committee. As local residents who will identify cities across the globe to establish new sister city relationships. I would also like to take this opportunity to invite each and every council member to join our association and think about a sister city in a country not so far away that you'd like to foster a relationship with. These are our current sister cities. So Jan Ying Sister City, who Alex Chen is actually the committee chair for. That is a very active sister city. We also get invited to their conferences every year where a small delegation from here gets hosted along with many others from around the country. Unfortunately, a reader Japan and a lending girl from Sweden are not active. We are in communication with the Consul General of Japan to move forward with either a visa or identify another city in Japan. The Jimmy Getty. Program is going to be headed up by Cynthia Bonta, and you will hear from her in just a few moments . This is exactly where Janning is. And the reason why I'm showing that is because. This next one. There's a slide of how our delegation to China was greeted and how excited this sister city relationship was for the Chinese people as well as the people of Alameda. So we have a picture of our delegates presenting a gift to the Jennings city officials. This one is Mayor Johnson shaking hands with the mayor of Jenin city. That is in that city. Excuse me. This took place in. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And with that, I would like to introduce Cynthia Barton, who is going to give you a little bit more information about what is going on with Dumaguete and where we're going to go next. Thank you. I'm really very proud to be the US aska Alameda Sister City Association chairperson where the Alameda Dumaguete is sister city to be. We hope that's going to happen in June. This is a slide show of a slide of the map and you can tell that the magenta is in the eye. In the province of Negros Oriental, which is in the. Island of Negroes. So Negroes has Oriental and Occidental. Dumaguete Magenta is located at the southern eastern tip of Negros Island with a population of 104,167. 20,000 of that are students and they consider is the source of their economic growth. Dumaguete there. The name was coined from the Vizzion word nugget, which means to snatch. So Daggett is the root word, dumaguete is the action word, and it became dumaguete there as the name too applied to the city to in order to show that the city does have the power to attract and keep her visitors. That's why it snatched me. And hopefully they will snatch you too, so that Dumaguete can be a really attractive sister city for Alameda. Dumaguete is the Capital Principal Seaport and largest city in the Philippine province of Negros Oriental, known as the City of Gentle People. It was named one of the most ideal places in the world to visit, considering climate, cost of living, crime rate, existing expatriate community and healthcare. Now beach resorts, world class dove sites and dolphin and whale watching are a few of the tourist attractions. So do I. Move this? Oh. Okay. This is downtown Dumaguete there and you will see that there is some Spanish history. That tower over there is really the symbol of the city. Actually, that was the picture on the gift that Mayor Sagar Barea presented to the city of Alameda when I got back last June, 2013. Around September. And you will see that there is a church there. The Philippines is 85% Roman Catholic, and almost all cities have a cathedral of some kind. And those little object transportation vehicles are called tricycles. The very creative Filipinos transformed their bikes into little tricycles so that they can have a livelihood of transporting people from one place to another. But do we get the likes to be promoted as an investment destination for commerce to resume and business process outsourcing? Presently there are centers for tele tech SBI Eventers and qualified one. I don't know if you know what those tech companies are, but they're in dumaguete there. It's known to be the largest call center in the in the world or Asia. So that's. When I visited and delivered personally a letter from the Alameda City mayor at that time, Marie Gilmore, we brought a gift to symbolize our good faith and goodwill, and I was presenting it to Manuel Tavis to Gabriela, the Mayor of Dumaguete that. So that was two years ago. So we are now preparing to host a delegation. From our Philippines sister city to be them to get there in June, possibly from the fourth to the eighth in hours. It right here. The main purpose of the diplomatic visit is to formalize the sister city relationship between the two cities, with the two mayors signing a memorandum of understanding. Sister cities create relationships based on cultural, educational information and trade exchanges, creating lifelong friendships that provide prosperity and peace through person to person citizen diplomacy. The next slide. Tells us what we've done. Okay. There was an interest expressed by both mayors and the mayors exchanged greetings, which was made public during the celebration of Philippine National Day event in 2014, last year in June. And right now, we're having ongoing communications between our contacts in Dumaguete and us to plan for the program so that that program might somehow be reflected in the memorandum memorandum of understanding. So to to come. Is a city of Alameda resolution. We're hopeful that that will come about because you do have to approve the idea of alameda and dumaguete becoming sister cities. And that resolution will also be sent to the monks at their. And now. We have been thinking very hard about what our approach would be in this. Alameda, Dumaguete is sister city partnership and the whole board of directors has been pretty strong and unanimous in their wish that the exchange will be mainly educational and that this educational exchange occur in different levels with the youth level a very important element and with the potential of having even faculty exchanges between Silliman University, which is in Dumaguete this city. This is an American founded university that is recognized in the United States. It up its structure is adopts a lot of the American style education. So it's now considered pretty international because they have exchange students all over the globe in different continents. So we want that to happen, especially for our young people here, so that there can be this mutual exchange for mutual understanding and peace. Be starting with the young people. So we have a very ambitious itinerary for the four days. We will keep you updated on that because we're still firming them up and. We also have already initiated conversations between the Peralta Community College's International Studies Office and Silliman University president. He will be coming with his delegation, and we will have an opportunity to actually talk to him about the different options that he would like to offer us as far as educational exchange. So I think we really ought to pride ourselves in the diversity of our city. To think that our first sister city is between China, brought about by our Chinese-American community and our second active sister city will be between the Filipino-American community here and, of course, the broader community of Alameda and the Philippines. These two are the largest immigrant immigrant communities here in Dumaguete. And no wonder. So it would be really exciting to provide the international character of our relationships right here in in in Alameda. I really foresee that in the future, if we continue to have sister cities with different countries, that we can actually have an international youth conference here where they can exchange ideas about what issues they face as young people and maybe even as young people address international issues. So that's our presentation. And we want to close by inviting. All to our first fundraiser at Dragon Rouge, May four. This is an opportunity to get updates and also to help defray the hosting expenses, which is quite overwhelming. But we can do it. Thank you very much. I guess we can welcome questions. I don't know a few. Thank you. The member comments or questions? Member, Desai. I'll just offer a comment. Thank you very much to Ms.. Bonta and also to Karen Fong for the presentation tonight and the hard work that you've done putting this together over the many months. I think also a hearty thank you should go out to former council member Stuart Santa, who was very instrumental in putting this together. This sounds like very exciting. I look forward to June. Thank you. Remember, Audie. Also want to say thank you for all the hard work. You know, it's it's about time that we do have a sister city relationship with with a city in the Philippines. The state of California, you know, 1.5 million people that live in California are Filipino Americans. It's the largest API group in the state of California. And, you know, we've been blessed to have three Filipino American Council members, Councilmember de Saag, Councilmember Chen. Councilmember Bonta, who's now the first Filipino elected ever in the history of the state of California to the state assembly. So I think this is a real good thing to commemorate the heritage of our Filipino Americans and Alameda. And I also want to thank Cynthia and our vice mayor, who is in charge of this program for a very long time, and also our former council member, Stuart Chen, for all of his hard work on this. I remember Commons. Well, we have had sister city relations for a long time because when I saw letting go Sweden on the on the list when I was a student at Edison School a long time ago, we all had pen pals and letting go. So I guess that's kind of fallen by the wayside, but it's good to refresh with some current choices. So thank you all for your hard work and really nice to see you. Young people, the students in the audience. I know you got your homework done before you came, so thank you for coming to. I just I just want to say thank you for, for that presentation and thanks to the council for, uh, in most attention and lending work. And I also want to join in thanking all of you that are here this evening on this item. And I have a question. You had mentioned, Ms.. Fong, in regards to Japan that you're trying to get a substitute city in Japan. And I'm curious, in regards to Sweden, if there's efforts to find another community within Sweden, since it appears that we no longer have an active relationship. I actually have a relationship with the consul general of Japan and for another, a community involvement that I am with. But we have not made any contact with Sweden yet as of now. So if there's anyone that in our community that's interested in assisting with, you. Know, yes, quite frankly, we're a small organization and we're just now getting our feet going. So it's definitely in the works. We do. We definitely do want to establish reestablished communication with Sweden. I am back up here at the microphone and I really want it to just open it up to everybody in the chambers. Right now. If anybody is interested in joining Almeida's Sister City Association, please let us know. And we have some brochures out on the table out front and you know, you can join a committee or you can head a committee on your own if you'd like to. So we'd like to entertain that. And just just for the record, I was just reminiscing. It was a lot of years ago when I was at Edison School. And I think I'm given the way our population has shifted in the current demographics, I think it's perfectly appropriate to have the sister city relationships that we have and that, you know, it takes energy, a lot of energy to put these committees together. So I would really support just starting with what you're doing and and growing from there. Well, it really takes effort to put the committees together. It actually takes even more effort to keep them going. We don't want to we don't want, you know, situations like a Rita and then to go away, I mean, to happen again. It's just that's just not what we're about. Does it make sense to establish these relationships and then, oops, let them die? It's kind of like friendships, you know, we want to you want to foster those relationships and keep them going forever and ever time. Yeah, thank you. Q Item agenda item four. We do have a speaker under oral communication. Jim Hager. Good evening, Mayor, fellow council members. My name is Jim Hager. I live on Randall Road across the lagoon from the veer off campus.

(City Manager 2210)","Thank you for the detailed presentation on the Alameda Sister City Association and the proposed sister city relationship with Dumaguete City in the Philippines. It sounds like an exciting initiative that will foster cultural, educational and economic exchanges between the two cities. A few key points I gathered:

- The association aims to create connections based on exchanges that promote mutual understanding, prosperity and peace through citizen diplomacy.

- Dumaguete is being proposed as a new active sister city, with a delegation potentially visiting Alameda in June to formalize the relationship through a memorandum of understanding between the two mayors.

- There is a focus on educational exchanges, especially at the youth level with potential faculty exchanges between universities like Silliman University in Dumaguete.

- It celebrates the diversity of Alameda, building on the existing Chinese sister city relationship driven by the Chinese-American community.

- You are seeking community involvement, whether joining committees or even chairing new sister city initiatives with other countries.

- There are plans to revive the previously dormant sister city ties with Japan and potentially Sweden as well.

It's great to see this grassroots efforts to promote international connections and cultural exchange. Engaging the community, especially students, in this citizen diplomacy appears to be a core goal.

Report from the police department on the recommendation received follow the application of Catalina Landing Inc. doing business as the Landing Bar and grill for Apprentice premise drafts or of an ABC license at 5730 East Second Street in District three. Some moved with conditions. That night on the conditions. I do. You should have a copy as well. Okay. That was you wanted to make sure. All right. We have motion in the second aim of the Public Affairs Council, item number nine. And also there is a one slight change in that. All right, we'll explain it. The the report had given a one name, but they're actually operating under a DBA of Commerce Katrina. You know, make a note of that. Thank you. So amended. Any comment over here? None of the public please notify yourself. You know the drill, Mr. Good you. Thank you. Name's Larry Goodhue. Clark has the address. Probably used pretty close to 3 minutes. I want to make a case for holding this over. For about 60 to 90 days, maybe longer, perhaps shorter. I think this action should be viewed in a larger context than just a transfer of a the impact of transferring a license in the name of a license. I think it must be viewed within the context of the problems that emanate from this and other facilities to varying degrees in Belmont Shore. In the same manner that although we don't have the type of savage behavior that I outlined earlier that was involved with that relative to some vagrants. The fact is the fact is we've got an overabundance of bars in that area, and there's an awful lot of activity that is truly negative, that has negative impacts in the area. And again, you heard earlier today about that if the plan to essentially make a de facto open public latrine by tearing down a house, I'm not sure what the answer is in that, although in one aspect, in dealing with the bars or the an overarching issue, I think the violator should be assigned to a if they're connected with a bar or even. Supporting pandering. They should be warned, given a warning the first time. Second time assigned to the feces, urine detail, cleanup detail every morning, whether it be somebody from a problematic bar. And I don't know the record of this one, but I know generally the situation it's down there. And I think you're presented here tonight with a unique opportunity to step back and wait, because I know there's going to be a significant change in paradigm down there. Fortunately, there's going to be good leadership within the Belmont Shore Business Association now, and I think they'll get some better leadership out of the parking association. But that in itself we don't know. So I would wait. I would suggest holding off 60 to 90 days and see what develops and get a sense of what the community is relative to that. Maybe by some device, by ballot initiative, whatever, the community will decide to reduce the number of bars. By a mechanism, we have decided maybe it will be a draw, a number or a lottery or whatever. But there clearly, as anybody except the most disconnected understand, there is a serious problem down there. And you're presented with that unique opportunity to help address that. Now hold off for 90 days. Thank you and. Thank you to the motion. And second, any further Republican members cast your votes on item nine. Motion carry sympathies. Aside, obtain clear.

A few key points:

- The police department provided a report with recommendations/conditions for approving the license transfer.

- A member of the public, Larry Goodhue, spoke and advocated for holding off on approving the license for 60-90 days. His reasons included:
1) Concerns about too many bars/negative impacts in the Belmont Shore area already
2) Wanting to see if new leadership in the local business associations would lead to changes 
3) Potentially reducing the number of bars in the area via a mechanism like a lottery

- After his public comment, the council voted and the motion to approve the license transfer carried.

- The next item was authorizing an agreement with Los Angeles County, though no details were provided on what that agreement covered.

Thank you. Item 25, please. Actually, item 24, please. Item 24 is a communication from Councilwoman Pries Vice Mayor Andrews. Councilman Austin recommendation to request an ordinance establishing rental increase protections for mobile home owners by adding mobile home parks to our content and protection ordinance. Think you have to turn this over first to Councilman Price. Yes. And I'm just going to speak briefly before turning it over to the public. I know there are a lot of people here who want to talk on this item. This item has actually changed since we filed it as a supplemental on Friday. And I want to thank our city attorney, Rich Anthony, our deputy city attorney, Rich Anthony, who's here who's been helping us. I think together we have learned more about mobile home law in the last three or four days than we ever thought we would. And we did have an opportunity yesterday afternoon to speak with an attorney representing the residents. And so I think that the I want to hear from the residents, but the item tonight is to be going to be giving the city attorney some the city manager some guidance to work with the city attorney to bring back some options for us at at a future time in November. And I'll share with after everyone finishes talking, I'll share with them where that's coming from in terms of my conversations with their attorney and what I think our timeline that we're working with is. Before the residents speak, I do want to share a few things. Many of you spoke last Tuesday night. I had already talked with your property owners before then. I talked with them on Wednesday morning. I asked them respectfully to go back to the drawing board and come back with a proposal that was more in line with where the city of Long Beach has headed in terms of rent increases. They have assured me throughout the week that they are going to do that. I expect that in the next couple of days you will be contacted with a revised proposal. I don't know what that proposal is going to be, but that's one of the reasons we're not able to really take any action tonight, because we don't know exactly what we're working with in terms of the proposals. And also, one of the other things I want to share is that this is not the mobile only mobile home park in the city of Long Beach. This one is in my district. So anything that I do that affects the policy in my district would affect the policy in every district. So it's very important for us to have the opportunity to be able to conduct some research and find out how many mobile home parks are we dealing with, how many residents are are we dealing with? And to give my colleagues the respect, to be able to reach out to the tenants in their districts as well as the property owners in their districts. So that's one of the reasons for the timeline tonight, which we shared with your attorneys when we spoke with them yesterday. But with that, if Mr. Vice Mayor, is it okay if we go to public comment? Yes. You know, since it's over ten people, I'd like to have these individuals come in as time as we are. Karen, Angela, Teresa, Tom Lockhart, Daniel Witt and Wayne Su and Larry Goode. Who in that order, please. You have 90 seconds. You have to. Many individuals. Good evening, Vice Mayor and council members. I stand before you with some of my neighbors and I'd like to have them all stand. I got to talk fast through those that couldn't be here. Wrote letters to Councilman Price, the mayor and chief of staff. And I'm sure that Mayor Garcia and Councilman Price, you've received several emails from US senior citizens in regards to our personal stories. Today we're here in unity, making a plea that you, the entire city council, collaborate. Kind of like basically what you just said with the 600 senior citizens in our particular mobile home park. But to place an interim moratorium on the space rent as soon as possible. And that is rent. Space rent for mobile homes. Only you. The city council can help us stop this tremendous burden of $355 a month increase. Which are aware of what equates to a 35% plus space rent. Newport Pacific. Our park management company can raise our rent again in 90 days if they so choose. So I please ask you and Time Investments to sign this interim moratorium and to help us senior senior citizens at the mobile home park. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next. May I present the letters to you? Seven. Hello City council. And. Particularly you guys would like to you can state your name when you walk, just maybe. I don't know. My name is. Wynn Sulk and we were able. To talk. Directly to Susie Price. Our councilwoman, after the last meeting, and we were able to clarify the fact that the rent credit that we've been offered in order to ease the burden of the 35% increase is actually contingent upon us releasing Newport Pacific from any kind of liability, which unfortunately is puts us between a rock and a hard place because of the fact that the construction is still ongoing and there are many, many repairs still to be done. There are punch list items for every resident in the park that have yet to be completed. So we still face the November 15th deadline to sign this our rights away. In exchange for this credit, I do want to thank Susie for expediting the teleconference with our attorney that I hired on behalf of Belmont Shores. And I also want to invite you to come to our community and see the charm of each individual home, which is actually what gives our mobile home park its value. It is not the pipes under the street that has increased the value of our park. It is the beautification of each resident, then the investment they've made in the home that makes it an appealing place for others to come and live in. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next speaker. Please. Tom Lockhart. With the emergence of very. Large real estate corporations in the California mobile home park market, there are too many cases of exorbitant increases in space rents paid by mobile home owners. This has also had the insidious effect of creating an artificially high so-called market rate for mobile home park space rents. Other companies, such as our Belmont Shores management company Newport Pacific, then use these exorbitant so-called market rate values to claim that a park is below market rate and therefore the rent needs to be raised. A comparable letter comparable levels as owners of older homes in our park abandoned them due to obscene rent raises, thereby losing the title and the equity in the home. Newport Pacific will replace them with brand new homes and sell those at a significant profit. Thus our mobile home park will be effectively gentrified and available only to upscale residents. Also, mobile home owners who do not sign a lease. Often are charged higher. Rent raises than homeowners who are under lease, which often forces the non leaseholders to sign a lease and therefore forever lose any chance of rent control. Nobody should be a pawn at the mercy of the merchants of greed in his or her own home. Without rent stabilization. Belmont Shores Mobile Estates residents are in an untenable situation. And if you want to enact. A very, very good rent. Stabilization ordinance, just get a copy of the City of Marina ordinance. Scratch out Marina and pencil in Long Beach. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Hmm. Good evening. My name is Don Wittes. I arrived in. Long Beach in 1948. I was seven years old on my way home. Following last Tuesday's sensitive city council meeting. I stopped for a red light at. Seventh and cherry. As I waited, I realized for I was participating in the purest form of democracy. Let me explain. Traffic lights do not discriminate. First come. First serve. Equal. Everyone is equal. Democracy at its finest. Everything. Every time you stop at a red light, you respect the law and your fellow Americans. If we all respect the law, good chance we will all get home tonight. This is the California Driver's Handbook. It is well-written, with good intentions. This is the. Law of the people. This is the notice Newport Pacific gave us. It is poorly written with questionable intentions. This is a law of the corporation. This is the law, a loophole. This is a law. A shocking. This is a law. Take it or leave it. This is the law of gotcha. Finally, I want to make a promise to you. I will always stop for the red light. Because I want you to get home to thank you. Next. And please. Sorry. Oh. Good evening, mayor and city council members. My name is Mary Jo. British. I'm its own vice president. Golden State manufacturers, homeowners like G at the mall for Los Angeles, Orange County and San Bernardino Counties. As one of the representatives for the Long Beach Mobile home homeowners, I implore you to, following your decision this evening, that on behalf of the primary elderly and other low income citizens to seriously consider voting a separate moratorium ordinance for mobile home space rent stabilization at 3% maximum increase each month in. And then this would be while the final arrest or rent stabilization ordinance has been completed, the fraudulent burn rubble sit in elderly, veterans, disabled, other low income mobile home , homeless and a fear of Long Beach are being threatened with urban economic eviction through outlandish rent increases, causing the loss of their homes and everything they have saved and paid for all their lives. Many still have mortgages. They need your compassion and protection. You. We would like to work with you to address this serious situation. The Interim Moratorium Ordinance on mobile home rent increases. One of the options that it's worked successfully throughout the state of California, where the final answer was placed the occurred in 110 cities and counties that have this L.A. County Board of Supervisors instituted it and turned into a moratorium ordinance in November 2018 at 3% max rent increases, and it's been extended until the end of the year whether final ordinance is going to be in place. Thank you so much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Larry, good. You I would extend this to every every rental property, whether it be mobile permitted just built. Extend it across the board, not just to those that are listed here. Thank you. Thank you. On the next next set of speakers, we have Philip write a Candace Holcomb, Lewis rib, Mike Murchison and Mary Jo Bacik. And I'm sorry if I mispronounce them names. I try to get the spellings on here. Philip Right. Candace Holcomb. Lewis Really? Mike Murchison. Mary Jo Bacik. Those next speakers, please line up in that order and please begin. Good evening, Honorable City Council members. Mr. Mayor. I'm here to support the Interim Moratorium Ordinance for space race stabilization for Belmont Shore and Mobile Estates. Just want to pop a number out there that no one's said yet, and that's 35%. 35%. That's the increase that a lot of folks are being hit with. I'm a recent resident. My increase is 20%, but I came in at a higher tier. The park is limited to 55 year old and older residents. Many were on fixed incomes or of limited means. And just to note. For your consideration. If residents can't pay the rent and have to find alternative housing, they're not permitted to rent their facilities. These are homes that they own. So they couldn't subsidize their income by renting out their current their current home if they were displaced. As as as the name implies, mobile homes are not really as mobile as you might think. It's very expensive to move them. And finding another place to live is another consideration altogether. 35%. Really? I'm not so delusional to think that I wasn't expecting to see an increase after the owners did some improvements in investment for deferred maintenance and infrastructure. To meet city and other ordinances. But again, 35% and out of their minds. Well, maybe City Councilman Councilperson Price, I'd like to thank you very much for your prompt movement on this. Thank you, Mayor. Thank you for your support. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Richard. Considering that. An elder living in a. Fixed income is half. Honorable person, I. Asked for this ordinance. We are a 55 plus community. Probably with the mobility in our property. None of our crews hook up the house to a pick up truck and say. Buy. To move any. Of the house it requires to be commercial truck and especially work that would cost almost the same price of the house. The company owner of this mobile home park knows that and is trying to force her to pay an abusive increase or have to sell the house for a price that because of circumstance, it would be clearly under the market. This is not a business between two equal power. That could negotiate. This is an attack on elderly. People that do not have any other resources that they. No pension and zero possibility of negotiation. This is not business, this elders. This is an aggression. On the tranquility and be that these people deserve in the last year of their lives. Please help us. That the right thing to do. Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Candace Holcomb. I represent Newport Pacific, the Property Management Company. We've worked long and hard over the last several years and have put millions of dollars into the property to restore it. Prior operators did little. And we had to in order to keep the park open and continue and do over 28. And it's our now $30 million into repairs into this property. And this wasn't something that we took lightly. These are long term investors and they've been trying to get to this property. It was under a land lease whole. And with that, the prior two operators did not invest. They did not do what needed to be done. The ownership even worked to suit some of those prior operators to make things happen and it didn't get done. So now we are where we are today. We also offered a rent credit. In addition. In order to help bridge over. It doesn't mean three years from now that this is the total end result. The Rent credit also stated that it may be extended. It also said in there that it could be ended as well. And part of the ending of that is if we had a major catastrophe. I met with the president on October 12. Thank you very much. And then committed to meeting with them again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please, Mr. Murchison. Good evening, Mayor and council members. I'll probably get the same boos, but I've had that before, so thank you, everyone. Let's go ahead and let Mr. Richardson speak. I do want to correct a few things, Councilwoman Price, to clarify, there's the ownership is committed to working with the tenants to try to come up with some more solutions. They are willing to improve their offer. They have committed on behalf of ownership to meet with the tenants in the next several days. You have my word on that. In addition to that, there'll be no rent increases, as the first speaker referenced about the potential for a rent increase. There'll be no rent increases in addition to over that first 90 days. That won't happen per the owners. Secondly, there was a mention of the November 15th date. The second speaker referenced that that November 15th date will be extended. So I will also clarify that. So I want to encourage you folks, the Council on the mayor, to do your due diligence, asked the city attorney and city staff to look at what other mobile home parks are in Long Beach, what the income levels are of the other mobile home parks in Long Beach. So that when you get this information back in 30 days, you can do your due diligence and make your decision then. I appreciate your time. And again, I want to remind everybody that we are willing to sit down the next several days with the tenants to see what we can come up with. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Richardson. Next group of speakers are Lilia Ocampo, Andrew Manuel, Manu HANO, Maribel Mireles, Maria Lopez and Vilma Aguilar. Please come forward. I see you just in that order. Please. Thank you. Can you repeat the Lilia Ocampo? Andrew. Maribel. Maria and Vilma. Good evening, Mayor. Council members. My name is Lola Campo, and I came here before you to support this item because as a renter, I have experience, increased rent and also a 60, 96, 30 and 60 days notice. And I know better the uncertainty of not knowing if you're going to find a new home for you and your family. And it's not it's not a good feeling. You'll feel like the world is falling on top of you. And that's why I understand situations that people listen and I strongly support them. Listen. Thank you very much. And here. Hello. My name is Andrew Medrano with the best hour central Long Beach, an initiative focusing on children aged 0 to 5. I would like to thank the Council for extending Rancho protections to other members of the city. It's important to note, however, that tenant relocation assistance is only a small part of the solution. Now that SB 1482 has passed, companies are taking advantage of vulnerable populations and evicting them as fast as they can. This is exactly what is happening with our leadership team member motivated Metellus and her entire building. Mayor, you wrote in an op ed and I quote, We will continue to utilize this collective of partners to meet the ever changing and most pressing needs of our youngest students and to help ensure that families have the tools they need to bring classroom learning into the home. I want to ask the council, can families bring this learning into the home when they are being displaced? No. According to the Long Beach Early Childhood Education Strategic Plan to ensure that every child can succeed, we must address the needs of the whole child, including physical health and stable housing. According to the Prevention Institute. Community trauma such as displacement increases risk factors that make adverse childhood experiences more likely to occur. In addition, displacement increases depression among parents affects children, academic performance, and so much more. If we all truly care about the whole child, then we need to take a strong look at the different issues intersecting and affecting their lives. Perhaps Long Beach should consider establishing a moratorium on evictions like L.A. so that these families aren't uprooted and these young children can lead healthy lives. Thank you. Next speaker, please. We're not not just me name, but as Maribel Mireles, job and representation on the street tonight will be born not Long Beach in front of the jordan high school.

Good evening. My name is Vilma. I am a tenant and a resident in District nine. I support article or item number 24 because all tenants deserve to be protected. Inclusively, I. Want. I want protections. I want sensitive communities to have the right to be able to stay in their neighborhoods and fight for healthy homes. Recently, our building was sold. I live in 550 64th Street. For the past 12 years, the conditions when I first entered were all right. But from. Four years. Behind had not been very great. The building was sold and so were us as tenants. West Star bought our building and gave us 60 day notice to leave. I feel sad because of this notification. I want. A stop to. All evictions and separation of families. Thank you very much. A next next set of speakers, please. I am one. I'm Maria. Oh, Maria. Okay, go. Ahead. Yeah. Good evening. Councilmembers. My name is Maria. I am a resident and the first district. I am also the director of Community Organizing for Housing in Long Beach and the Long Beach Tenants Union. It's evident that tenants are suffering in our city and they need solutions. We've been talking about this. We talked about rent control. Last year wasn't the solution. We came up with tenant relocation assistance. Now we need stronger protections and evidently we need a moratorium on evictions and rent increases like the city of L.A.. Just just put placed into history today. We want development without displacement. Right. Tenant relocation assistance is only a means to mitigate displacement, but displacement is still happening. Right? We're not saying that we don't want honest repairs. We want honest repairs and development with the same neighbors. Right. We also want to push the messaging more to we know that in communities where they own their home, they are not displaced. So we want to. Push. To the view of community owned housing and allowing our communities to really strive and have access to healthy, dignified, accessible and affordable homes. Thank you for your time. Thank you. My name is. My name is Teri Quinlan. And Mary Jo already spoke, so I'm taking her place. And Mama just didn't call your call. You know, you called Mary Jo twice. Mary Jo Broderick from GSM, AOL. And she already spoke? Yes. What's your name? Terri Quinlan. I don't have any on the list. Just go ahead. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the city council. I thank you, Susie Price, for paying special. Attention to us with regard to our mobile home issue. It must be obvious after hearing from some tenants. With regard to the current ordinance. That there are people who rent apartments. And then, of course, there are people who rent space in a mobile home park, mobile home not being mobile. And we as owners of these units that are in the park cannot move the unit out for a cost of maybe 20 to $40000 to do so. So we are a captive tenant on the property. And so there have been about 100 cities, cities and counties that already have implemented something called space rent stabilization. And we are hoping that the city will take on this as a new issue, a new moratorium that would save us from the proposed increase in our rent. I submitted a petition to all of the City Council members and Mr. Garcia with attachments that list the cities that are currently under this stabilization ordinance, and also a list of the all of the people in the city of Long Beach that are part of mobile home parks. There are 13. At present with about 2000 spaces in all of those homes. We are hoping that you will see the significance of mobile home owners as separate from the current ordinance and move forward accordingly with that. Thank you memorandum. Thank you so much. And our last speakers are Antonio Zavala with Salva Camacho, Jennifer Millan and Julie Paul, those folks here. Good evening. My name is Antonio Sabella and I live on Long Beach.

I'm in a peacekeeping of either not so. I'm sorry. And then we'll skip the net. And I just felt that it was gas and the company that wasn't communicating it to I don't know what was best seen as good as. Yes. Thank you. Maria, do you want to translate some of our. Good evening. I am a resident and. Tenant in District nine. I am I am very glad to see the support. Of item number. 24 today being discussed because just like others in my community, I am affected by evictions and high rent increases. I support. That. The residents in mobile homes. For them to get relocation assistance and to be more protected. But I don't want it to stop there. Right now, me and my neighbors of years are in danger of being uprooted from our resources and those we love. I have lived on 540 East 64th. Street for the past five years. The conditions have not been the greatest. The companies abuse of us. And at the end they when. West are brought bought my. Building at a at a low cost gave us 60 day. Notices. I feel. Empty because Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming. And I don't know what to do. We need to have better. Laws that allow community to stay. In place and have the right to fight. For better housing with the same neighbors. Thank you. Thank you very much. Speaker, please. Good evening, councilmembers. My name is Jennifer Miron. I'm a student at ABC C. This is my mother, Carmen Garcia. Our family has lived at five 5064 Street for the past ten years. We are tenants in the ninth district. We support. I am 24 because we believe our tenants deserve some sort of relief. However, we will help you. We will hope you all work to achieve better communities with the same neighbors and our communities to stay in place and enjoy the new and the new memories coming to our neighbors neighborhoods. Recently, our building was sold. West Orange Is the New Landlord on Friday at 11 p.m.. Our neighbors were giving us extended notice, which we will eventually have to leave. This makes me feel sad because we are being taken out of our community, which we live for over ten years. This affects our lives and our kids and my parents because I see them as stressed and not knowing where we going to spend our holidays. I will. I would like to see. I would like for you to send me more in Council Member Rex Protection. But we invite you to come to our building and you to speak with. Our. With our neighbors. Thank you very much. And a last speaker is Jerry Park. Good evening, Mayor and members of the Council. I'm Julie Polley with the Western Manufactured Community Housing Association. We're a statewide trade association that represents mobile home park owners throughout California. And we're always opposed to mobile homes, rent control. And I want to thank you for taking the time to add this to the agenda and to give us the the the the the needed. Study on this. Issue. And I had a lot of concerns that Councilwoman Price has addressed in her comments before. So I want to thank you for the adjustment in approach to this, because our concern was that the best solution here is a private solution. In fact, many times these can be resolved between the park owner and the residents for an outcome that works for both. But when you start with the stated outcome of an ordinance that doesn't give that that process much to to grow. So I wanted to thank you. And if I could leave my card with the appropriate staff member so that we can be part of that process, so that the city can understand the impact this will have on all of the mobile home park owners and throughout the city. Thank you. Thank you very much. That concludes public comment. I'm going to go back to the dais. I want to start with Councilman Price and then we'll go through the members. And I want to do one. I'm going to make some comments as well, and I'll. But thank you all for speaking, Councilman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you to everyone who came out tonight to speak in favor of this item or related to this item. I know it's not easy to come to council meetings. Many of you have come for a second week. So I thank you for that. I will say that obviously any time we have vulnerable communities who are looking at being displaced, we need to act. And it's important for us to do that. I also agree with the last speaker, though, that we have to we have to give processes a chance. And so I've reached out to the property owners at the mobile home park and asked them to try to work on something. And I've shared with them my disappointment in what has happened. I hope that means something. Maybe it doesn't, but I'm asking the residents to please. Far out. A little bit of the tensions right now and give the new proposal. Well, I don't even know what it is. Some opportunity, because what the city can do and how the city can get involved in private interactions is always limited. And the best progress long term for you is going to be figuring out how to work privately with them to come up with a long term deal that works. It's just going to affect your day to day better. It's just going to be better, I think in the long run. That's just my opinion. We could agree to disagree on that. But what I'm sharing with you is that I have I've pleaded with them to come forward and give you something that is reasonable. I am hoping that they do that. And I'm asking you to give it. Honest and meaningful consideration. That's all I'm asking in regards to what we're going to do as a city. What I'd like to do is and I want to ask this, our acting city manager, if this is reasonable, is it reasonable for the city attorney and city manager to come back on November 19th? And that's that's less than 30 days. I get that and I apologize for that. But if we do need to take any sort of action before January 1st rent increases, I want us to be able to have some time to do that. So November 19th would be the target date for city to city staff to come back with some information for us, including how many mobile home parks are in the city, how many residents do we have that are impacted by space rent issues? What are our legal options? And the the people who spoke on behalf of the mobile home park residents? You're absolutely right. What I have learned in the last week, very different than regular tenant law. It's a whole body of law that people have developed an expertize in. And I know Mr. Anthony is working on that, but we need to know what our what our options are in terms of mobile home law, how that might align with existing rent stabilization ordinances, both locally and statewide. And what options do we have in terms of timing? Is that reasonable to come back on November 19th with some options for the city council? Yes. So you're correct. That's not a whole lot of time. But we realize the time sensitivity to this. And so at the council would like to direct that. We would do our very best to come back on the 19th with as much as we know and give you some options. Yeah. Oh, excuse me. Councilmember Price, as you know, since this popped up on the supplemental agenda and since the many of the same residents that spoke tonight spoke a week or two ago, we've been off and running. So we have a bit of a head start. I think we could get enough information to reasonably inform the council to take a decision with some options by the 19th. That should work. That would be great. And if we need. And just so everybody knows, we put this on the supplemental agenda, which means it went on the agenda Friday as as an item of urgency. So we don't do that very often. I think I've done that like twice in five years. So I want you to understand, you know, we're we're we're. No, no, no. Don't, don't. Please, don't. Don't stand up. Don't, don't, please, don't, don't, don't go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, so I just want you guys, please. I just this is my job. I'm doing my job. My colleagues are all doing their job. We all care about where you land, but we also want to understand everybody to understand we need some time to figure out what the policy is going to be, because whatever we do for Belmont Shore is going to apply citywide. And all of my colleagues here have mobile home parks in their districts. So they're going to need to educate themselves. They're going to need to talk to property owners. So, too, the property owners are management company representatives who are here. I to hope and pray that there is a private resolution that comes out of this. Either way, mobile home parks are going to be included in our tenant protection programs. Thank you. Councilman Nelson. Thank you very much. So, first of all, I'd like to just commend the residents for for organizing and sounding the alert and getting their city council office and bringing the issue to the entire city council so quickly. Obviously, we want to support and commend the council member for her quick action on this matter as well. When we first heard of the facts a week ago, I think we were all pretty taken aback by, you know, the claims of 30 plus percent, 35% rent increases, which is nobody can claim can weather that that's that's disruptive to anybody's lifestyle. And and again, we we have been as a city council dealing with the issues of renters protections with them in terms of, you know, multifamily housing. But mobile homes have been off of the reservation or I would say just out of the conversation for for the entire time. And so it just made sense with the actions of the city council recently, the last state legislative actions recently. It just makes sense to include mobile home residents in our city in those protections as well. I will certainly support that. I think it's only fair. Certainly been down this road with a few of our parks over the last few years and some of the outcomes have been, you know, I think favorable for for the park residents, a mobile home park residents in a district where, you know, friendly village. They they recently had a a class action lawsuit came together just like you all did. Fought back. And, you know, things are happening there. So that said, I just, again, want to commend Suzy Pryce, commend the residents for her, for organizing and understanding that the work that you have done certainly will of have an impact on our city as a whole. So thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrus. Yes. First of all, I want to thank Councilwoman Price for bringing this to our knees to the diocese. I'm even more excited, Mr. Wilks. I don't know what profession you're in, but after have to listen to your comments. I do know that I'm going to stop for any line. I'm going to follow the law, just like you said. I'm so excited. You know, sometimes you worry about when you get to be a certain age. I'm a senior citizen and I see now when we get tired of being tired, we come out and let you know how we feel about it. And I just want to let you individuals know tonight, you have spoke loud and clear. No one should have to be misplaced. When you talk about 35%, you don't even have to pay that much debt for a down payment on a home. And they're trying to tell you. The collapse is fine, but I'm afraid because being a senior since I want to move into, you know, I just and it doesn't look good for me. But I'm telling you, the way you guys are speaking tonight, I have hope. I still have hope. And I know what, Mrs. Price, when she gets on, when she gets on something, she won't stop again to you. Something will be done tonight. And I'm told her support and only the sad thing about it, the other individuals talk about rent control. These young individuals here they are look into and they're listening. If we keep going at this rate, we'll all be homeless. We're going to have to do something. We had to do it. Now, we cannot just keep putting Band-Aids on these situations. So I want to thank you so much, Mrs. Price, for coming out with this on the diocese. And all you individuals come out tonight and speak, especially we are seeing you. We we're in bed at this time. But I just want to thank you guys for coming out. Thank you very much. Thank you, Councilman Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to take a minute and just acknowledge some of those residents from 540 and 550, 64th Street who received those 60 day notices. I'm aware of that, visited that site. I visited those apartments. I know what they look like. I've seen the conditions is deplorable. That's a slum. We need to be more. We need to have more tools to protect people from slumlords. I have to tell you, you know, if it if you know, what I'd love to see is for the city to be able to provide a resource to acquire property like that and make it covenant affordable housing because it's actually great positioning is right by Hampton Park. It's a great space. My vision for that space was the city to be to do affordable housing conversions and help stabilize that those two buildings and continue to provide affordable housing in those areas. But in order for that to happen, we're going to need a willing property owner. We're going to need a dedicated source of local revenue to make those things happen. There's a lot that a lot of schools we still don't have that we want to have in order to provide what we need, which is great affordable housing, that's quality that that provides dignity. So my commitment to use I'm going to continue to work on this. I'm going to meet with you, you all your group. And and we're going to see whatever, whatever resolution we can provide. I know that what we did most recently with our tenant protections law does add some additional support. But I know how shocking and jarring it could be to receive a 60 day notice. You know, I did not grow up a homeowner. I grew up a renter. You know, I attended 13 public schools across five states. I know what it's like to move to get to be housing and stable. So so I understand. And we'll be we're going to continue talking in terms of in terms of this motion, I think it makes sense. Councilwoman Price, you know, I wasn't here last week. I heard about it. Thank you for moving so quickly on this. I think I think it makes sense. I have a number of mobile home parks within my district, both Villa Park and over on Long Beach Boulevard. We have another Westland site. So I'm going to engage with those communities to get some input. I'm going to you know, I've had we've had conversations internally. I've had conversation with the mayor and others over the course of the last year or so about what's the appropriate approach to mobile homes, given there are a whole separate section of code, a whole separate section of state law that governs it and it doesn't mesh as easily in one ordinance. So I think we do need to take our time and figure out what the best approach is, and we need to conduct some outreach to stakeholders. And I think there is a there's no reason, you know, you've heard I've heard the stories. I've heard great job at public comment. 35% is is way too high for anyone. And we're hearing stories like this all over the place. So you have my support and I look forward to to what what comes of this. Thanks. Thank you. Councilmember Pearce. I thank you and thank you to everyone that came out so often. When we hear some of these stories about rent increases or people being evicted, it's really challenging for some of those communities to make it here. So I really appreciate you guys really being involved in making sure that all of us understand the urgency. Same thing my councilmember said 35% is absolutely insane. I've been a lifelong renter myself. Obviously, I have grandparents and they are on fixed incomes and understanding what would happen to my grandmother if she received a notice like this and she doesn't live near me. And so I can understand each of you have a personal story, in effect, that this would have the comment that an issue like this should be handled privately. I think that we have historically seen, and particularly in the state of California, that when it comes to housing or land use, it's never best to be left to the private sector to try to figure that out. We know that there's a dynamic in power that that is difficult. And so I hear you and I think my counsel calling for bringing this quickly, sometimes with issues that are this complex, we kind of we bring our hands over how to do it just the right way, and we just got to put it on the agenda. So I applaud that. I'd like to ask the city attorney, I know it's only been a couple of days, but just it was my understanding when we began the the reload conversation that mobile homes had to be left out. And I understand that maybe that's just because they're owned. You know, the building is owned by the person that habitat, but that the land is not. But can you tell us could something like including this in a reload policy be done like from your cursory look, I know that you're coming back with research. But I think it could. But thank you for asking the question, because actually I'm going to well, that's the short answer, but I'd like to take an opportunity to maybe clarify, clarify, maybe some potential miscommunication or misunderstandings on my part. The several members of the public and some council members behind the dais have mentioned the tenant relocation program that the Council adopted applicable to residential properties in May, effective on August 1st. In fact, it's mentioned in the council letter that was put together, which I think was somewhat hastily put together because Councilmember Price was trying to be reactive as quickly as possible to constituent concerns. But I think what I'm hearing from almost every member of the public and from everyone behind the dais is really what you want. Staff and myself to research is is not so much bringing mobile homes under the umbrella of the tenant relocation ordinance, but rather bringing you all back options to apply a rent stabilization ordinance, which is more protective. But at the risk of upsetting people, correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what that's what I think the direction I'm going to take back with staff and we're going to come back with options. More along those lines on November 19th. A component of that could be relocation, could not be depending on what direction we get from y'all. Thank you for that for that clarification. I know this is Councilmember Price's item, but since it was an answer to my question, I think what I've my quick look looks like there's about 101 cities in California that have mobile home stabilization policies. And so being that this has moved fast, I guess understanding the difference in between that and how a relocation policy might effect or be added to a mobile home stabilization policy. We can certainly speak to that when we come back on the 19th. Yeah. I also I mean, I recognize I have a mobile home in my district that's also in pediatrics. So we just voted earlier on a visioning for pediatrics and I would imagine would be an area that that land value is going to go through the roof as we finalize this process. So definitely support protecting our mobile homeowners as much as possible. Thank you guys very much. I look forward to the presentation next week. Oh, I did have one thing. Could you also include in your presentation if it's if it's doable, the vacancy rate of our mobile home parks? Because my question is, if we had 340 mobile home residents that had their land increased by 35%, is there somewhere for them to go in the city? Thank you. We can try and that vacancy rate data is really difficult to come by. So we will do our best to answer the question. I can have a staff call around each of them and ask how many? Thank you. Thank you. Constantly, Ringo. I'm not going to speak a lot on this, but I do have a mobile home park in my district as well when we're villages. And I think that everything that has come forward at this point, thank you for the clarification in regards to what is going to be included in the study, because I think it's very important for everyone to know. And I hope that when you're doing the outreach, you also reach out to the other mobile home parks in the city as well. That's very important. They need to be made aware. If they're not experiencing some kind of increased rate now, they probably will. So we need to have that in place so that we can protect them as well. Thank you. Thank you. And I know we're going to everyone has a chance to speak. We do have a motion on the floor. I'm going to ask you a few comments and then we'll go to the vote. I just want to just first reiterate my support for this process and the motion in front of the council tonight. I've had multiple conversations with Councilwoman Pryce, and she's been great about keeping me and my team up to speed on what the issues are. And a lot of you have reached out as well. And I really, really do just really feel for the situation that you're in. I know I said it last time you were here, but nobody should have to face a 35% rent increase, especially not a senior on a fixed income. And so I think what's what you're all going through, we all are here to to help to help this process. I agree that there are there are multiple options, I think, in front of the council. I am I am glad that they're going to be coming back quickly so we can have a broader conversation about what is possible. I would like to see and I think it's possible for this council to support a policy that that is fair and reasonable, that would support not just you, but all of our mobile home parks across the city of Long Beach. If you think about what is happening with the statewide, some folks mentioned Governor Newsom and and the statewide bill, I believe. I mean, that bill, as we know, exempts in many cases or in most cases mobile homes. We know that the tenant relocation program that I supported and folks supported here that was in front of this council did not include mobile home parks either. And so clearly, that is a gap. Any, any, any and something that I think should be addressed by by this body. Let me also just say that I'm I'm I do support this approach because I think Mr.. Mr. Anthony you'll be able to to give us and give the body some some input as to whether this really is a a new program that is that is based on stabilization of of rents around mobile home parks. If this is some type of of companion legislation to the tenant relocation ordinance and what that actually could look like. And so I am hopeful and looking forward to seeing those different options that you bring in front of us. I will say more broadly, there is a lot of changing law on this in this topic that is in this area that is happening very quickly, not just what the state is doing, but how what the state has done also affects the city's tenant relocation ordinance and how what we do needs to align with the state as well. And so those are all discussions that are going to be happening over the next few weeks and months ahead. And and just please note that we will be monitoring this closely. And I just really want to thank you all for coming out and making us aware of this huge challenge in front of us. So thank you very much for being here. And. And please know you have my support. I look forward to working with all of you on this account. Councilmember. Councilmember Supernova. Thank you. I'd like to thank all the speakers tonight and to those who I communicated with individually. I hope I was realistic and not pessimistic. I hope I was successful in explaining the process and telling you how this was in Councilwoman Price's district. And that handoff, I think I'll have to agree, was a great resource. I think she handled this beautifully. So thank you. I do have a question about the item that we're about to vote on. To Mr. Anthony. If I understood you correctly, you would would you say that it's more than likely this will be a stand alone ordinance? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is that where we're going? And I don't want to put words in the council's Matthew. Matthew, the policy makers. But yes, that would be that's what I'm hearing y'all say. A tenant relocation ordinance applicable to mobile. Homeowners would not restrict. Rent increases. And just about everyone has spoken about the need to restrict rent increases. That would be pursuant to a rent stabilization ordinance. Like many, many members of the public and councilmembers have have spoken about, there's over 100 jurisdictions in California that have mobile home rent stabilization ordinances applicable only to mobile homes. So we would not be treading new water in that regard. And I would expect most of the options we bring back will be. Along those lines. Okay. So the point of clarification is we're not looking at the wording we have on the agenda. I know we're looking at what you just stated. That's right. Okay. Thank you for that. Yeah, right. Thanks. Thank you. And Councilman Mongo. I just wanted to thank you all. I know that housing is a necessity and an emotional time, and I think you've been very professional. And I just want to commend you on coming forward today. And I hope that this unity will continue on once this has passed and that you've been able to gain more than just a a unity behind rent rent increases, but just to get to know each other and be a part of that, it's an amazing thing. I've gotten to know a few of you and I'm just so thankful for having had the opportunity, and I hope you guys are over each other as well, so some good things can come of it. Thank you, Councilman Price. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify one last thing in regards to my intent for this item. The intent look, the tenant relocation program, our ordinance that we passed here really doesn't apply to a lot of the issues that the mobile home park owners have. You know, 30 $500 or 40 $500 isn't going to do anything for them for relocation. My goal was to help them with the rent increases. So if we have an ordinance that we pass in the future that protects them from rent increases, I think it's only fair when the city is protecting other tenants from rent increases and the state is now protecting tenants from rent increases. So my goal is for us to have some options in terms of rent stabilization because the relocation aspects of our ordinance really don't apply to our mobile home park. So that was I mean, you're right that I put something together just to get it on the agenda, but at the time I did not know how different these two needs are and how mobile home law has its own very, very established set of laws. And that's perfect. Thank you. That makes me feel better about the way I characterized the direction that we'll take back. And thank you very much. And one one last thing also. Mr.. Mr.. Parking. Mr.. Anthony, I do think when we bring this issue back, I also just want to make sure, obviously, because I think Councilman Price is right here. Obviously, the state has enacted and the governor has signed a series of of protections, rent caps, just cause in a variety of different protections for renters and tenants. And I just also think it's important that as we discuss this stabilization ordinance, which is certainly, I think different, that we look at the broader picture of all of our tenants across the city of Long Beach and just make sure that we are that if that the state is providing that level of protection for everyone and that we fill in gaps when appropriate. So I look forward to that, that discussion as well. And so with that, we have a motion and a second source. Please go ahead and cast their votes. Motion carries. Thank you very much. Thank you all for being here. We're going to hear. She went 28 and 23.",Recommendation to request City Manager to work with the City Attorney to draft an ordinance establishing rental increase protections for mobile home owners for rent increases of 10% or more by adding mobile home parks to our current tenant protection ordinance.,"Here are a few key points from the discussion on rent protections for mobile home owners in Long Beach:

- Councilwoman Suzie Price brought this issue forward after residents of the Belmont Shores Mobile Estates faced a proposed 35% rent increase by the property management company Newport Pacific.

- The council directed the city attorney and staff to research options and come back on November 19th with information on:
    - How many mobile home parks are in Long Beach and how many residents are impacted
    - Legal options for potential rent stabilization/control policies specifically for mobile home parks
    - Timing considerations if any rent protections need to be in place before January 1st

- Several council members expressed support for exploring rent stabilization policies for mobile home parks, separate from the city's existing tenant relocation assistance policies which may not adequately protect mobile home owners from large rent hikes.

- The council wants to understand how any new mobile home rent policies would align with recent statewide renter protection laws (AB 1482).

- There was discussion about the unique situation of mobile home owners who rent the land but own their home unit, making relocation extremely difficult and costly compared to apartment renters.

In summary, the council initiated a process to research and potentially develop rent control/stabilization policies tailored specifically for mobile home parks in Long Beach in order to protect those residents from excessive rent increases.",0.7812500000000001,You are a helpful AI assistant.,Hello!

Listening to you are we have a rule that will allow us to shorten the time, but we're not going to do that.

Please refrain from profane or obscene speech in your comments address council as a whole and refrain from individual attacks. Councilwoman, can each. Flynn, will you please put Councilor Bell 903 on the floor? Thank you, Mr. President. I move that Councilor Bill. 903. Be placed upon final consideration and do pass. All right. The public hearing for 903 is now open. Can we have the staff report, Karen? Good evening. Council Brooks Council members. My name is Karen. I'm a principal planner with Landmark Preservation at Community Planning and Development. And this is the Packard Hill Historic District application. In 1967, I Landmark Preservation was established within the city and county of Denver. Since that time, 336 individual landmarks have been designated and 52 historic districts, which represents about 4% of the city and county of Denver. For the process of designating applications or submitting designation applications. They can come from owners of properties. From the manager of Community Planning and development. Members of City Council. Or in this particular case, from residents within the historic district. This district application was submitted by 17 applicants within the proposed Packard's Hill Historic District boundary. For properties that are designated, they are designated as is. There are no requirements to improve a property or to restore it to particular time. The intent is to preserve the historic character of the neighborhood. The design review is required only for exterior changes to the building that requires building or zoning permits. It is not for general maintenance. We don't review paint colors. The building is not frozen in time, and so the design guidelines are intended to allow changes for properties within a historic district. Properties that are considered, considered contributing. It's highly discouraged for demolitions of those particular properties. Here's an example of some of the design guidelines pages that are within the adopted design guidelines. They address a wide range of topics, but deal with the preservation of the historic character. There are small things like fences and retaining walls, solar panels and sustainability. We do a large number of roofing reviews. We also do additions to buildings, new infill construction and secondary structures. Those are all addressed within the design guidelines. About 70% of the reviews that we do within Landmark Preservation are reviewed by landmark staff. Those particular design review applications are smaller in size and must meet the design guidelines per ordinance. Landmark staff reviewed about 1200 applications in 2016. Those are sort of divided into what we call quick reviews, which are typically one day reviews for replacement of roofing, a replacement of existing fences, replacing of AC units. The smaller projects that are administratively reviewed by landmark staff, typically within a 10 to 15 business day period are fences, garages, solar panels and smaller rear additions that meet the design guidelines. The other 30% of the projects that we review go before the Landmark Preservation Commission. They're larger additions in fills pop tops. The commission is made up of nine commissioners. Two are recommended by the American Institute of Architects. Two are recommended or one is recommended by the Landscape Architects. Two Recommended by Denver Planning Board. Two by History, Colorado. And two are at large. And these are just some recent design review items that have come before the Landmark Preservation Commission of Infill Construction. And they show a range of whether people tend to do something that is more historic in nature and more traditional, or if they do something more modern. And this the design guidelines really talk about infill construction or pop tops or additions to be compatible with the character of the neighborhood in sort of the massing, size and scale . So these are two recent projects that are in the most historic district that were recently approved. Here are two modern takes on an Italianate in the Curtis Park neighborhood. The one on the right is actually done all of shingles and the one on the left is all in brick. So they're very obviously new construction, but kind of feel feel like they fit fitting within the neighborhood. And so there's been just a lot of questions about what does compatibility look like. So I wanted to give you guys some examples of that. And then finally, here's one that's very modern. This is within the Wyman Historic District. And you can see what it looks like from the front. But this is a rear addition with the glass cube at the back. So changes can be made in a variety of different ways. And I know people have been talking a lot about design review, so I just wanted to give some sort of brief examples of things that have been recently approved. For this particular application. It was submitted by 17 community members who live or reside within the boundary of the proposed Packard Hill historic district. It is in Council District one and it is roughly bounded by Lowell Boulevard and the alley between Osceola and Perry Street and 32nd to 35th. It's a primarily residential neighborhood. The boundary is established by the applicants when they submit the designation application. It is within a area of stability within Blueprint Denver and it is mainly a single unit and two unit zoning. There's a little bit of you next to kind of down at the very bottom. So as this process has proceeded. Landmark Preservation Staff attended two public meetings that were held in January and February and March of this year. The application was then submitted a leader in the spring, early summer, we sent honor notification letters to all of the property owners as listed by the Assessor's record to everyone within the proposed boundary. We notified the registered neighborhood organizations as well as courtesy notifications, notified City Council Planning by planning, board and building inspections, posted signage prior to the Lpsc public hearing. After I had gone through both LPC and the Denver Planning Board, we sent out of another owner notification letter to everyone who was on the assessor records to notify all property owners within the boundary. So when we review a landmark designation application, whether in a district or an individual, it is looked at as the criteria established by the landmark ordinance, which is to main maintain the historic and physical integrity to meet one designation criteria and two or more of the following categories history, architecture and geography and relate to a historic context and theme. This is what is analyzed by landmark staff as well as by the Landmark Preservation Commission. For this particular desert district, there were 82% of the buildings were considered contributing. And so when I had mentioned earlier that contributing buildings, it was highly discouraged for those to be demolished. 82% of those are were determined to maintain the character of the historic neighborhood. So 82 were considered contributing within the historic district, which helps maintain its strong, historic and physical and integrity. Both landmark staff and the Landmark Preservation Commission found that the property or the district met the criteria for historic and physical integrity. I also found that it was a stat that it had met under history, under I'm sorry, history and architecture under two categories. So this is the how it meets it under history is having a direct association with the historical development of the city, state or nation. This shows two maps one a 1905 based map, which shows in pink the buildings that were built out at that time. And then a 2016 overview map. The blue line on the map shows where the historic trolley line was established at this neighborhood, was established initially as or hoped by the developers to be established as. A very high style for the wealthy for wealthy individuals. And there are a few homes that look like that. But in the end, it really ended up being a middle class neighborhood that was able to commute within to the city and county of Denver due to the trolley line. And so the establishment of the trolley line is really intricately linked with the development of this particular neighborhood. And this reflects nationwide trends of people sort of escaping the vice in the industry of of an urban core and moving out and in its place, actually literally moving up and away from the the pollution of Denver at that time. The area is also having direct association with Denver's women's history. The authors, as they researched this application, found that a high percentage of the women were active in the women's rights movements, in suffrage, in women's organizations and in temperance, which ties strongly to the development of this particular area. This was an area that had basically a prohibition against alcohol. And when the community was looking to be annexed into Denver, it was actually voted down by the women because they didn't want there to be drinking in the area. And in order for it to be annexed into Denver, it had to be allowed that there would be no alcohol served at in that area. There was also women who were highly developed in the real estate area and they were actively employed with buying and selling within the Packard Hill historic district as well as outside throughout Denver . So this has strong links to Denver's women's history. It also meets it under history criteria C for having direct and substantial association with a person or groups of persons who have influence on society. This is a short list of some of the people who are included in there. We have an early livestock raiser and mining investor, an artist who helped establish Denver's first art museum. I'm an acclaimed actress of the stage and screen in Spring Byington. Dr. Mary Ford was an early and long time female doctor in the area. We also have an early writer and reporter and temperance activist Bert Bosworth. And then there are two mayors, William Fitz, Randall Mills and Benjamin Stapleton. Stapleton is included because of his role in the development of Denver and his terms as mayor. And so his influence is noted within the application. But it also must be done while recognizing and documenting and examining his active role in the KKK as well. Architecture. It is also significant under architecture by embodying distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type. It is significant for its queen in an Edwardian architecture. And as you can see at the bottom, there's sort of the high style. And then at the top, you see some ones that are. A little less decorative. It is also known for its classic Cottages and Denver Squares, which were which developed as a way of a reaction against the high style of the Queen in architecture. There are bungalows as well. They turn out a little bit after the turn of the century. And then English and Norman Cottages and then terraced type buildings that are a significant as a way to bring you know, oftentimes one person would live in one side and they would have a A on the other side. And so the development and the architecture of this particular district is for shows sort of how Denver styles are applied, but really done in brick because Denver is so heavily is so often built out of brick. And so it shows the application of nationwide styles as applied to Denver and Denver's working class. And finally, it is significant for the work of a recognized architect and master builders. So the first is a noted Denver architect, William Quail Quilt. Most of Quill's work has been demolished, and so this is one of the few buildings that is left of his. It is also the residence of some of the important individuals within Denver or with within the Packard still historic district. And then on the right are David and Tilden. Cox they are a master stonemasons, a father and son. And so they ended up building two particular buildings. And this shows their workmanship, workmanship and craftsmanship. And they also lived within these. So it was basically an advertisement for their work. And so they are very noted stonemasons. So the landmark designation criteria ordinance requires that it also meets a historic context or theme. So it meets the context of late 19th century growth of the Highlands, the expansion of the tramway system that helped further development annexation into Denver, and then the continued growth of the area up through but tapering off at World War Two. The period of significance are the time period for when something is determined to be significant, reflects that that historic context and growth. And it was established as 1886 to 1940, which reflects the early development, the continued expansion in this slowdown due to World War Two. The Landmark Preservation Commission found that it met it under historic and physical integrity, that it made it under history, under criteria A and C, under architecture to A, its distinguishing characteristics of styles and types and significant examples of the work of recognized architect. The Landmark Preservation Unanimously decree recommended that be sent to City Council for your approval. It also went to planning board only districts. Go to the planning board for their review, and planning board has a very narrow scope. They consider a proposed designation with respect to its relationship to the comprehensive plan and the effect of the designation upon the surrounding neighborhood. Such other planning considerations as may be relevant if they if they feel there's something else that needs to be discussed. So this meets the comprehensive plan. The designation application is consistent with the plan recommendations. It reinforces the city and neighborhood character and respects and enhances the interest intrinsic, historic and cultural character. And they found that it met the comprehensive plan. This is a blueprint to Denver. It shows that this is primarily a single family residential area and it's concept plan use. The proposed district would help preserve the single family residential character. And historically, as the trolley line ran along 30 seconds and established a mixed use character. It's part of the neighborhood center, and so that would be helped retained by the historic designation. For Blueprint Denver. It is located within an area of stability. The guiding areas of stability are keeping valued community characteristics in older and stable neighborhoods and identifying and maintaining the character of an area while accommodating some new development and redo and new redevelopment. Historic designations in general help identify and help retain the character defining features of a district and provide stability. The Planning Board also looks at the effect on the surrounding neighborhoods. The purpose of this particular designation is to preserve the character defining features of this neighborhood. There would be little impact on the area around as landmark purview is only within the boundary of that particular historic designation on here. Anything in Brown is an established historic district, and in red are the individual Denver landmarks. The intent of this designation is to recognize the unique district and the buildings that define it. Planning Board recommended that this met the both the comprehensive plan and blueprint Denver and that it would have little effect on the surrounding neighborhood. They voted nine one to recommend approval of the proposed district. We received numerous public comments on this particular designation because so many of the public public comments that we were received came from the same individuals. CPD counted it as individuals who commented to us. So we received by the deadline that we submitted to Denver City Council on last Thursday, we had received letters or comments and or signature cards or petitions from 222 individuals. Of those, 187 were in support and 35 were in opposition at the Landmark Preservation Commission. There were 24 members of the public who spoke at that 14 were in support and ten in opposition and at planning board. Nine were in support of the designation application. So in summary, the Landmark Preservation Commission found that it met it under its required ordinances for historic and physical integrity. It met it under the designation criteria under history and architecture and under the theme and context. All right. Thank you. Kara, we are, um. Okay, we're. We're up to 90 speakers now after we've gone through the. Getting everybody loaded in. We just loaded up and said we have 90 speakers. And so everything I said before with the exclamation point. Okay, I'm going to call the first five speakers. You're going to come up to the front here and go right ahead and we're going to try to move expeditiously. The other thing that I'll tell you is please make sure you are letting us know your address. And it will be especially helpful if you let us know if you're in the in the zone which the the area in question, if you will. Okay. Marie Benedek, Dehaze chairman. Say COO Michelle Bauer. And Ira. So, so quiet. I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name. Why don't you guys all come to the front row here? If you heard your name called and Marie Benedict, you are first. You have 6 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Council members, my name is Marie Benedict. I am a property owner in the proposed historic district and I live on Osceola Street. I'm very much in support of this historic designation. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. A large team of volunteers from Parker's Hill has worked tirelessly for over 20 months, reaching out to neighbors, first fostering conversation and answering questions. The high level of support from over 77% of the properties who took a position is the result of that extensive outreach. I would like to ask everyone who's here in support today to stand up briefly to be recognized. Thank you very much. We are proud to be in front of you today with a proposed district that meets or exceeds all necessary requirements for passage. We appreciate the opportunity to bring this forward in a Democratic effort with strong support among property owners. And we appreciate the opportunity to have a say in our future for our neighborhood. Our extensive outreach campaign is one of the aspects of our nomination that has received recognition. Also, volunteers have raised over $7,000 to support the historic research and the multiple, multiple rounds of outreach in all different forms, including door knocking, block coffees, producing several informational fliers that were shared with all property owners, creating a Web site, sending out 24 emails, I think, and mailers by mail as well by U.S. Postal Service. Five of those. Since December of 2016, we have urged homeowners to provide their response to the proposal numerous times, including several times via regular mail. They could respond via phone, email or a two question Internet survey. You have the result of those responses, with 75 owners in support and 21 in opposition. For anyone who told us that they were in support, we held them to a very, very high standard. We checked that they were the property owners of that particular property against the DeMars assessor's database. We also made sure that all owners of a particular property sign and support a form for that property, and we submitted 75 of those forms. And you should have something that looks like this. Many of them with two signatures or I don't think we have more, so many of them with two signatures in your materials during the 20 plus months of outreach. We checked several times against the assessor's list to identify properties that had sold, and we removed those signature forms of properties that had sold. The last such check we did around August nine, as we were preparing to go to Ludy to bring this to city council. We believe that our neighborhood is worthy of protection and that a historic district is the best tool for preserving the 150 plus historic buildings in it. And we believe it's good for all property owners in the district. The stability and balance that a historic district brings will be good for all property owners, and it's also the only protection that is on offer for you to decide on tonight. We know from experience that any other tool would take 5 to 10 years to work out if it had support, and that at that point, it may well be too late to protect this historic place. We're proud to present you with with our application for inclusion as a Denver landmark district. And we hope that our efforts will be rewarded with passage of this bill. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Ms.. Benedict Dehaze, you have 3 minutes. Hi. My name is Dehaze. I own my home at 3218 Newton Street and I'm strongly opposed to the historic district. And I'm unhappy with a few neighbors. Who want to change my property. Rights after I've lived there 33 years. I'm 82 years old and I. Believe the tax credit. Scheme is unfair to me and my elderly homeowner neighbors. The increasing costs and. And. It, and additional regulations are often also discriminatory to us. I'm a retired R.N. and my beneficiary is a501c3 National Nursing Organization that supports registered nurses who are in severe, dire circumstances, illness, injury and so forth. And. I want when my time comes. I want my personal representatives to be able to sell my house. To anyone who wants to pay the most money. And I don't want it to have a whole lot of onerous design restrictions and regulations. Please vote no. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Chairman. Seiko. Good evening. My name is. I'm sorry, Chairman Sekou. He's right behind you. Come on. Come on, Sicko. Oh, I thought it was charming, Slater. Sorry. I got to tell you, that's probably the funniest public hearing in town. Yeah. Let's give it a round of applause. That's a lot of courage to represent me. Okay. Yeah, go ahead, Judge. Yeah. All right. Sure. My name is Chairman Sekou. I'm the. Founder and organizer of the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Who represents poor working, poor, homeless and senior citizens throughout the city and county of Denver. I stand before you? Neither for or opposed to this thing. But to appeal to the conscience of folks as we go through this democratic process to see if we can figure this thing out. Because after it's all said and done, everybody got to go back and be neighbors. Is that right? Yeah. And it's okay to disagree without being disagreeable. Right. Because we're civilized. All right. And part of the political process is not to do the pro versus con, but to blend the two together. So it's a win win thing. If the if the yes is when all the time or the no wins all the time. Bad trade deal. Bad trade deal. Because what you create is disharmony within the city that requires unity. In order for us to build a place where we can be free and live in harmony with one another and feel good about being in the city of Denver. And so it's not just about proclaiming propaganda wise that we are a family. Oh, this is a great city or what? How do you live like that? How do you live like that? You've got to tell the truth how you feel. And folks got to respect that. So part of the process of learning how to blend and harmonize is that the know got to put themselves in the shoes of the yes's and the yes has got to put their self in the shoes of the nose. And now we're talking about a very basic principle call. We go work and play well with each other. That was the criteria in kindergarten for the kids before you got a, B, C, D, you flunked. So we can't block on that. And we got to grow up. From our. Places of self interest. And talk about. Hey. We can do this. We can do this. Are we talking about is regulations? And we're talking about policy. And all of that can change. See what we do a blending. We do a blending. And we've got to blend, amend this so that we don't end up mixed up in the mess. And so the name of this game today is called Challenges, Choices and Solutions. CC Yes, if it ain't about the challenge. Not the problem. Because we can solve it causes us. We can do this. And it's about the choices that we make. Consider all the folks feelings, interests. And then do it in a way that makes common sense. That it will work. You're filming your film. Come on, now. So part of our responsibility is leadership. Is to make sure that all the voices are heard. Before we make the decision. And then consider how this thing can go. Where we can have unity and peace in the city so that we can grow up and be a place of attraction for other folks and a role model for how you can do this. And we can blend this and be an example of how we can make this nation great. So great the way we used to be neighbors. And we're going to stay neighbors. And we're going to stop all of this acrimony, frame this in a way like the president was saying, you know, and, hey, calm down, you know. You know, it must be exciting. Boy, I look serious and that. This. Sacred, you know, I got one more minute and 34 seconds, so I'm going to do what you suggested. Okay. Because other people need to talk. I pretty much said what I wanted to say, and I thank you very much for entertaining the possibility. And hey, give peace a chance. You'll feel me there making sense. Oh. That must say. Cool. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Michelle Bauer. Good evening. My name is Michelle Bower. I live at 3344 Mead Street in Denver. I have lived there about 18 years and my husband has owned the home for about 22. I'm here today to say that I'm in opposition of this bill. I can completely empathize with my neighbors, who I see in this room who have struggled with the evolution of just a little three storey high rise and now a five storey high rise and and some kind of funky construction that's gone in the neighborhood. But I don't think the landmark district designation is the solution to protecting our rights in the city. I do believe that we have a city and county government that regulates building and construction, and I would encourage our community to step back and take a look at that regulations being enforced. One of the things that drew us to this community to live. My husband first and myself after we married, we didn't choose to live someplace else was the inclusiveness of the community. And I feel like a landmark designation. Was it exclusive? I think it makes us a different community and I think it creates barriers. So I would really encourage this committee and this group to reconsider the landmark designation and look at other options. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Ms.. Bauer. IRA. So. I'm sorry if. Thank you. It's Ira Kelkoo. It's your account. Okay. I was close. Okay. Sorry, sir. You have 6 minutes. Thank you. My wife and I own and live at 3343 Osceola Street in the proposed district. And we are strongly in favor of the application for historic district designation. Historic designation is not about saving pretty houses. It's about creating community and a sense of place. And in our e-mails in favor of the district, we emphasized our desire to maintain our community's character while allowing for complimentary new construction. We're not anti-development. We're pro sensible development that provides a sense of place. And in my comments today, I would like to focus on the arguments raised by the opponents to the designation. They would have you believe that design review associated with historic designation is an overly bureaucratic process that unnecessarily delays renovation projects or demolition of properties. They would further have you believe that design review makes a property less marketable and violates property rights. These alternative facts, however, are in reality a false narrative, and they should not be the basis of your decision today. These are the actual facts. Studies consistently show that properties in a historic district appreciate more quickly and in a greater amount than in similar non-designated areas. And why is that? That's because people today, homeowners today are seeking out unique areas with character, not just an area that would be similar to many other areas. They want a specific, unique area. Also, another very important fact is that according to the most recent statistics available, the landmark Commission's approval rate for design review requests was 99% of these approvals. Over 81% were administratively approved in an expedited fashion by the Landmark Preservation Staff without ever having a need for a formal landmark commission review. That directly relates to the argument that you'll hear that there is great delay associated with the process of design review. 81% of requests are handled quickly. By the staff. And then even with the entire amount of requests, 99% get approved. Design review can preserve property values if viewed in the spirit of a partnership between the Landmark Preservation Commission and the property owner to maintain an area's integrity and rather than as an adversarial process. Also only exterior changes that require a building permit require design review. For instance, interior changes and landscaping do not require any design review. As far as the role of government goes, a basic and accepted role of government is to maintain orderly community development, especially in areas of stability, which blueprint Denver has denoted the Packard Hill area. Local historic preservation ordinances such as the one in Denver, were upheld by the United States Supreme Court as a proper role of government and not in violation of property rights. This decision from the U.S. Supreme Court was decided in 1978. It was the Penn Central case, and it was decided, therefore, almost 40 years ago. It's a settled issue that this is not a violation of property rights. A local historic designation ordinance. The vast majority of property owners in the proposed Packard Hill historic district do not object to historic designation. Those that do object are relying on scare tactics without a basis. In fact, and my wife and I urge you to vote yes in favor of the application to designate the Packard SEAL historic district. Thank you very much for your consideration. And thank you. I just want to say the first five did really well in coming in their time. And thank you for setting the tone. All right. Next five, come up quickly. Paul Hudgens, Chris Myles, Ricardo Gonzalez, Yvette Harrell and Bradley Brubaker. Paul HODGINS You have three months. HEDGES So sorry. You have 3 minutes. Thanks. Good evening. My name is Paula Jones. I'm the owner of 3344 Newton Street in the proposed district. I would like to start, first of all, by pointing out that this. Is the design guidelines for Denver landmark structures and districts. This is a double sided. This is what all of us become subject to. If this bill passes tonight. I see this as nothing less than a wholesale taking of my property rights. I bought this house in May of 2001, and since that time, I have mentally constructed the house that I want to build on my lot. And then which my wife and I want to retire. Please don't do this to me. To us. Or to Denver. It is profoundly unfair. Thank you, Mrs. Hudgens. Chris Miles. Hi. Thank you for letting me speak. My name is Chris Mars. I live on 3286 Mead Street. I'm in the zone. I'm a fourth generation North Denver native. And I'm going to tell you a story of how my family got to this neighborhood. In the early 1900s, my great grandfather as a young teenager was traveling the country working for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. He was a ranch hand simple cowboy, and one of his jobs was to take care of Buffalo Bill's personal horses. According to what has been passed down to me, Buffalo Bill was not an easy person to work for. And in the words of my great grandfather, he was a mean, old drunk. The show had come into Denver and one night Buffalo Bill came into the tent where the horses and livestock were held. He was a mean drunk and ready for a fight. An argument broke out and Buffalo Bill fired my great grandfather. He was out on the street with no way to get back to where he had come from. A couple of years later, he got back on his feet and by the end of the 19 oh, by the early 19 tens, he had bought a house on the block of 33rd and Quitman, right on the edge of Packard Hill's historic district and three blocks from where I live now. He married one of these bold temperance ladies that you've heard about in the presentation earlier. That's a whole nother story. And raised his family in this house on Quitman. This house is where my grandfather grew up in the twenties and thirties. 82% of this neighborhood that my great grandfather came to over a hundred years ago is still there. 82% of the neighborhood my grandfather and mother roamed as kids are still there. The architecture, the history and the front porch culture that started with my great grandfather is still there. We have a unique opportunity here to help preserve this historic neighborhood for generations to come. Throughout the neighborhood. I've noticed throughout my neighbors, there's a pretty strong support for this historic district. But a few of my neighbors still feel this is the wrong direction. But I still love them. Unfortunately, a lot of this has been fostered by misinformation and exaggeration. This has not been helpful in this process. But I have found many people, once they take the time to get the facts straight, they see benefits and they see and their support. They see the benefits and they are supportive of the historic designation. On my street, Meade Street. We are very a very close group of neighbors. Every Friday and Saturday, around 5:00, we are out on the porches, enjoying life in our awesome neighborhood. This will continue. And I look forward to all of us coming together after this decision is made and celebrating this neighborhood that we love. Both sides. Tonight, I ask you, members of city council to side with the homeowners and residents in helping to preserve this beautiful neighborhood that my great grandfather came to so long ago. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Miles. Ricardo Gonzalez, please hold. Please hold your applause. I know there's going to be a lot of great speeches, but just give us a little time. Ricardo Gonzalez, thank you. Hello. My name is Ricardo Gonzalez. I grew up at 3271 Mead Street. I've seen a lot of changes over the years as I was growing up there going to North High. And one of the things that always impressed me is how the neighborhood has changed. I like the changes. There's a few changes. That happened that I disagree with. But they're pretty cool. If you get take a look and see what's happened into the neighborhood and left. I'll say 40 plus years. One of the things that I'm always hearing, the historic designation will make it a stable neighborhood. It is a stable neighborhood already. Why do we need to have the historic designation to make it stable? It's already there. Just take a look through the neighborhood. Look what some of our neighbors have done. They've taken some of their old bungalows. Made beautiful pop tops out of them. Phenomenal. I love it. And I keep seeing more. And I'm like, okay, this is a changing neighborhood. Still got some old character. Got some history there. Why not change it? One of the things that drove me nuts is when I took the gentleman showed. How thick that guideline is. I'm an engineer. I enforce codes quite frequently. I have to read them. I have to understand them. The common person is not going to understand that. It's going to cost them a lot of money. To hire an architect, hire an engineer to get that information pass through. It's going to cost a. Lot of money. We don't need the historic district for it. If they really want to maintain their house and I'm said this is for the ones who want the designation. If they want to maintain their house as a historic district, do like they did y'all showed of that stone house. It's beautiful. The sun Lowell. Drive by it frequently. Get have them get their houses, go ahead and put an historic register their house, not everybody's house. Don't force us all to have to go to another book to have to read, to understand it, and then find out that some parts of it do conflict with the building code. Do conflict with electrical code. They say it's all external, but that's. A lot of work. The outside is what makes a house a home, but it's what's inside as well. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Gonzales. Yvette Herrell. Good evening, our city council. I think probably a lot of what I would say has already been said, and I know we're limited for time, so I'll try to make it short. Oh. I live at. 3425 Lowe Boulevard. And I very much support this historic district. 3425 Laurel Boulevard. As most of you may already know, it's the stone house. That's the cook's house. When John and I looked. For a place to live. We looked around Denver, lots of different. Neighborhoods, and we chose this one. We chose the neighborhood first. Before we chose our house. And then we looked around the neighborhood for a while and this house came for sale and we were fortunate enough to buy it. There have been changes in our neighborhood, but not I wouldn't. Say substantial changes. The neighborhood seems to be very stable now, but our concern is that what would happen in the future? We would like to keep it. Where, you know, the architecture is. Complementary. We're not opposed. At all to new development or, you know, people redoing their homes. We just would like to keep it so that it stays. With the character that we have. Now. It's historic, in fact. Denis Gallagher used to do a lot of his tours through our neighborhood. In fact, I heard him out on our porch with a whole lot of people one time looking at the house and our house next to that house, next door to us was built by David Cox, the same stonemason who was , you know, early he was an early. Denver stonemason. Did a lot of work around Denver. A lot of his work is. On a lot of the historic buildings that we have. And by the way, our house is a his it's on the historic registry. And I'm very glad that it is because it preserves it'll. Preserve it for our future. And I think that there are a lot of people in the future who will, you know, who will want these kind of places. And once they're gone, you can't ever give them back. We'll never get it back. It's gone. And I think it would be nice to just save it for our city and for future generations to come and like to. Look through like they do today. Because we have. People who. Come in and walk through the. Neighborhood and take pictures. And enjoy just being there because it's such a nice place. I have a big, long speech here, but I'm not. Going to do it because I'm sure it'll get covered. And I know you're all one to go to, so. But I do want to express that I would really love to see our neighborhood saved and and really the folks that are opposed. We would never hold that against them. This I know this. Is our democratic. Process. And we're going to all be neighbors and. Try to stay friends. Thank you, miss. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Bradley Brubaker. Thank you. I'm Brad Brubaker. My wife and I bought our home at 3253 mead seven years ago. So we are also in the zone. We chose West Highland for a lot of reasons, but mainly because there were so many good things going on in the neighborhood. And I'd like for those good things to continue. And I'll say that my wife and myself and my four year old and my two year old strongly oppose. The historic designation. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Brew Maker. All right, we have five more. Please come to the front when you hear your name. Court. Linda Paulson. Madeline O'Connell. Annie Levinsky. Kevin O'Connell. Patricia Kunkel. Yup. That's five. Linda Paulson, you were first. My name is Linda Paulson. I own my home at three, four. Two, one. Newton Street in the proposed district. You know, there's something remarkable about an old neighborhood, a sense of history and familiar landmarks are powerful elements which. Foster a connectedness between neighbors. That's why I'm 100% in favor of. Designating my neighborhood Packard's Hill, the newest historic district in Denver. I feel very lucky to have purchased one of. The more unique homes in this district 27 years ago. 14 years ago, I thought it would be necessary for me to move in order to accommodate. The need for more studio space. The thought of leaving my cherished neighborhood was quite unbearable. Instead, I worked with an architect to design an addition that would compliment the house while respecting the. Existing streetscape and, more importantly, respecting my neighbors. I would say the result is a success. Learning more about the. Origins of this district and its. Notable women has been a joy to this history buff. In fact. The person who pulled the. Permit in 1911. To build my house was named Minnie McGrew. As compelling as the history of this district is. An unexpected side benefit for me of this movement towards historic designation has been the joy of meeting neighbors who love this area. As much as I do. I urge you to help us in preserving this unique neighborhood and not just our little piece of turf. But for the long term benefit of the city of Denver. As I have personally met a few of you. I have been consistently. Impressed by your interest and. Dedication to our city, and I thank you for that. Thank you, Miss Balsam. All right. Madeline O'Connell. My name is Madeline O'Connell. I live in Denver at 32, 75 and 3273. Osceola in the district. And I have lived there for over 22 years, and I'm an artist in the neighborhood. I'm against the proposed district because I feel it is an overreaching attempt at stopping change in our neighborhood. I believe there are other ways to address the growing pains without such excessive impact on homeowners. The process is also flawed and undemocratic. We have been up against significant resources of the city and historic district. I have met with the proponents of the district several times over the last year, have asked questions and voiced many concerns. What I got in return was a lot of that's a good question and I'll get back to you on that. It never got inadequate response. I went to community meetings and endured long presentations from the career historically and was offered, was offended that our time for questions was shortened by their overruns as well as out of district pro historic shills asking questions. As an example of the overreach, I showed a photo of our 2004 contemporary home to John Olsen. I was told that the design does not conform to the historic guidelines, and if destroyed in a catastrophic event such as a fire, we would not be able to rebuild our home the way it was and be made whole. How is it possible that our security in our home, we designed and built can be threatened in the name of history? Basically. That is unknown artist who lived there a century ago is so important that I need to conform to her style of home. Living in a historic district would increase our insurance premium, according to our agent. The imposition of the 226 pages of rules will cost property owners time and money, hurting the elderly and the lower income residents the most, who also won't benefit benefit from the state tax rebate, which I was told was better than nothing wrong. It's discrimination and elitist. This process is told a great personal expense of hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars, not to mention emotional angst. There's a palpable resentment in our neighborhood. Becoming a historic district will cause more problems than it solves. Personally, I feel beat up by the process and I'm left with this. Final plea to my city council to hear me and vote no on Packer Till. Thank you, Mr. McConnell. Any Levinsky. Hi. I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of Historic Denver, where a. Nonprofit organization. With 750 members from around the city. And we've been advocates for historic places for 47 years. I'm here just to provide a little. Bit of perspective about historic districts, how. They come to be and why they matter to our city. Denver's preservation ordinance was created 51 years ago. Larimer Square became the city's. First historic district, followed by Humboldt Island historic district near Cheesman. Park was the first residential district. That decision and as was Larimer Square. We're not without conflict, but they are now deeply. Appreciated by us to enjoy. Over the last 50 years, City Council has seen fit to create 52 historic districts. Those 52 districts include a range in size from 1 to 1000. These districts contain less than 5% of Denver's buildings and an even smaller percentage of the city's land area. The average historic district in Denver includes 140 structures, making Packard's hill a very typical size. So why districts? Why designate a group of properties rather than only individual property is because it's the ensemble that gives identity, quality and character to a district. Can you imagine LoDo if we only had one warehouse on Wynkoop? It is also the ensemble that offers benefits to those inside, including the residential tax credit program. Other also we have created. 52 districts in 51 years. We have not created a district every year. The last two districts are. Spaced apart by nearly six years, with the creation of the final. Curtis Park District in 2011 and the South Lincoln Historic District in 2016. As you know, South Lincoln was an unusually small district. So as a city as a whole, we have not created an average sized historic district for over six years. I highlight this to demonstrate that historic district proposals are not undertaken lightly or frivolously. Furthermore, in those years, we have also witnessed high. Levels of demolition in our older neighborhoods. There have been over 3000. Demolitions of primary structures since that last average size historic district. The majority of these were single family structures in single family zoned districts, and that might defy perception. But it's important to understand because it shows that in large part the loss of our historic fabric is not being done to increase the number of housing units, but simply the size of the preservation ordinance. In its first declaration states that the protection enhancement, perpetuation. And use of structures of and districts of historic architectural and geographic significance is a public necessity. And it is required in the interest of the prosperity, civic pride and general welfare. Of the people. That's no less true today than it was 50 years ago, and the applicant neighborhoods of Patrick of Packard's Hill have done all. That has been asked of them to meet a high standard of significance. And documentation and a high standard of public outreach. This is an appropriate and reasonable use of the historic district tool, and we urge your support. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. Levinsky. Kevin O'Connell. Thank you. I'm Kevin O'Connell. I'm going to slow it down a little bit. I live at 32, 73, 37, 75, and I've been there 22 years. Here's what we know today. Today, we know everyone here in this room cares about our neighborhood. We know no one in this room wants to see it destroyed. And we all have concerns about unbridled and unrelenting growth. But we also know the preservation ordinance is broken. It gives there's no distinction between a house or a group of houses. If this district passes, it will in fact cause harm to some of my neighbors. We know that within the boundaries more people are against the district than are for it. And if you are for the district, please raise your hand. Anyone. If you don't live in the district, put your hand down. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Mr. O'Connor. Home and the community. The neighborhood. Address. Address us, please. Thank you. Essentially, we're dealing with David versus Goliath. We're the David to the preservation Goliath. I'm asking three things tonight. Of the district vote against the formation of the council, rather. Vote against the formation of the district. Modify the preservation ordinance so we can have a consensus based approach to. Preservation. And develop metrics so that everyone knows what a standard is to make a place historic. Now it's just the support. And as you can see, we have very widely differing ideas of which support is the path forward is going to take time and effort. I know we can do it. And reaching out to Councilman Espinosa, my neighbors, to develop a set of criteria we can all agree on, let's find a consensus to move forward and save our neighborhood. But we have other options instead of jamming it on people. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. O'Connell. All right, Patricia Kunkel. My name is Patricia Kunkel, and I'm a property owner in the proposed district at 3417 Mead Street, and I absolutely support the designation. I live in a 1908 classic cottage and truly believe the proposed district is a win win for all property owners here. A historic district would mean we can welcome infill development because it would seek to complement and enhance the distinctive character that drew us here and which we all cherish. And it would ensure that we wouldn't lose over 150 properties that are historic and that contribute to the feel and enjoyment of our neighborhood. No other tool would do that. And that is why I think it is the right thing to do to protect the character and history of our neighborhood. Also, Denver guidelines, which apply in all historic districts. Would help guide. New construction additions, extensions and pop ups. They would ensure the changes to the homes in our neighborhood are compatible with the home being modified as well as the neighborhood as a whole. In my opinion, that is very reasonable and I hear from many sources that Denver guidelines are very reasonable. They are designed to encourage. Adaptive reuse, reuse of solid existing homes while allowing for modernization and extensions to fit today's lifestyles and needs. And these guidelines are just that guidelines. They are not written in stone. They are do allow for flexibility in how the cause of compatibility has reached. I urge you to help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Miss Kunkle. All right. We have the next five. When you hear your name called, come up to the front. Matthew Brown, Trevor Greco, Christina Holderness, Marilyn Quinn and Alex Holderness. Matthew Brown, you are first. Thank you. I live at 3341 Newton Street, right in the heart of the proposed district, and I strongly oppose it. My house kind of looks like the house. And up right now I've got. A couple of duplexes, a couple of houses down that are already built. Couple of pop tops around me. I'm fine with all of it. It's development. It's the way it goes. But, you know, the horse has kind of been let out of the barn in the neighborhood. The developments already been happening. I don't think it's fair for the council to impose something that's going to make it very difficult for me to do what I want to do to my house, which is pop the top in character with the neighborhood. It would be financially irresponsible for me to do it if this bill passes. If that happens, I will be moving out of my house, moving somewhere else and turning my house into a rental property at some point. I've got two young kids and my house will not be big enough. So. At this point, I just urge you to vote no on this proposal. I don't like the development that's going on necessarily, but I don't think that you can legislate taste. Thank you. Can you say your name just for the record? I don't know if Nancy Brown. Okay, great. Thank you. All right. Trevor Greco. Thank you. My name is Trevor Greco, and I live at 32. 84 was Yola. I'm in the zone. I wanted to cover one topic that I haven't heard yet tonight. And I really appreciate the neighbors telling their stories, and I really do appreciate that. But there's also one one other aspect is that historic districts help preserve, and that's about sustainability. So I live in a 1908 cottage, simple cottage. And, you know, the by definition, living and preserving that building is green and good for the environment because of the embodied energy that's already been used. All the all the resources back 100 years ago, it's 108 years old, was was sourced locally. Most of our homes in our district are brick. They've lasted for 100 years. They're going to last for another hundred years. And according to the EPA's 2014, which is their last report on waste, construction and demolition waste as was 200 are sorry, four 534 million tons and half of that or sorry twice. Let me clarify this. So twice the amount of of waste that we put into the dump every year is from construction and demolition. So think about it this way, is that our waste management goes around the city and collects garbage from city, from residential and commercial businesses. Twice that amount of garbage every week is put into our dump. And we think, well, how much of it of that is demolition versus construction? 90% of that is demolition. Demolition is the major contributor to our waste issues here, helping preserve encouraging people to reuse the adaptive reuse that you've already heard tonight encourages that reuse of the facilities that we already have. We can still build our homes bigger, pop the tarps, build the basements, the extensions, basically. It's just this is so unnecessary, especially in an area of ours where all the homes are brick or most of them are, as I said, they've stood for a hundred years there, stand for several hundreds more . So with that, I urge you to please preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Greco. Christina Holderness. Hello. My name is Christina Holderness. I own the property at 3221 Osceola in the proposed district. I am adamantly opposed to creating this district. Thank you so much for letting me speak tonight. I want to tell you that the landmark committee and the pro historic petitioners claim that there has not been has not been any significant objection . To this proposed district, and this is untrue. There is significant opposition to the district. To illustrate this fact, I made a poster to show you how many residents are opposed, which represents about half of the 175 residences in the designated area. I realize all of you have a lot of paperwork and perhaps the thousands of documents you receive all the time. You may not be able to review, but I would just like a moment to show you. Everything in red is a house that has said. Can you can you get a little closer? Can you get in front of that mike there? That's a great. So when I printed the poster, that's when I printed this poster. We had 72 residents opposed. Now we have 75, according to the petition. With that many residents opposed, we honestly we don't have consensus on this. We don't have a meaningful majority in our neighborhoods. Supporting the district to approve the district is really to disregard the concerns and rights of almost half of the constituents impacted by the decision. I ask you all. Even if my posters showed half red x's so instead of 72, there were 35. Do you feel does it seem ethical and fair to impose this designation on our neighborhood? If I were sitting in your chairs, I would think we would need 80 or 90% consensus. We don't have that. I am not against preserving historical buildings and monuments. I appreciate the value of history. I appreciate all the work everyone has done. But there must be a less contentious way to accomplish that goal. Perhaps an overlay. We have approached our council member as well as the pro historic group to ask for an overlay and it has been met with a resounding no. It won't work. It seems actually so fair. Allowing neighbors the freedom of design's householders. Yes. Your time is up. Okay. I'm sorry. Thank you. All right. Marilyn Quinn. Okay. I am Marilyn Quinn. I live at 3249 West Fairview Place, two blocks outside the proposed historic district in a property with historic designation. I'm also co-chair of the West Highland Design and Preservation Committee. In 2015, our committee first identified the Packard's. Hill area as having potential to be a historic. District. And we applied for a state historic fund grant that helped to pay much of the cost of research. To prepare the nomination. Change is inevitable, but the old and new can co-exist. Denver's design guidelines helped guide growth and change in a way that respects our history and protects property values without unduly burdening homeowners. Northwest Denver is seeing a lot of change, according to. CPD records. During the past six years. About one third of the permits issued in the city for residential demolition, residential construction and permission to demolish historic buildings were issued in just one of Denver's 11 Districts Council District one. Where Packard Hill is located. It can be disturbing to return from a short trip and find familiar landmarks gone. I'd like to echo Mayor Hancock's words from June 25th Denver Post. When you lose the houses, restaurants and places where roots were grown, you lose those stories and that history. You lose the soul of a neighborhood. And our city loses a piece of itself that it won't ever get back again. We don't want to lose Packard Hill, as you've been told. 52 Denver neighborhoods are designated as historic districts, but only four of those are in northwest Denver, where development pressure is dramatically and irreversibly altering our built environment. As you can see in the nomination, this area's rich history has value to its residents, to residents of West Highland, and to the city of Denver. Some Packard Hill neighbors oppose creation of the district, as did some when we created the Ghost Historic District. Most of those who were opposed in Ghost now support the historic district completely. Their concerns about burdensome regulations did not turn out to be a problem, and they have seen the benefits of added stability and certainty in the neighborhood. I'm sure you know about LoDo or Larimer District. When it was created it was over objections of 80 to 90% of the property owners there. But now it's one of the highest valued areas in Colorado. I hope and trust this will be the case in Packard Hill when it is the historic district. I respectfully request that you act tonight to help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Quinn. All right, Alex Holderness, you have 6 minutes. My name is Alex Holderness. I own the home at 3221, Osceola, the non contributing structure, one of the 18% in the minority. In this particular situation. Dear Council members, thank you for your time tonight and for allowing us to participate in the governance process. Please bear with me. I'm going to read my comments because I want to make sure that the fear and anxiety, both regarding this process and in standing in front of you, do not get the better of me. I sent a letter to all of you and to the Landmark Committee on August 31st, 2017, expressly expressing my personal concerns and asking for your vote no tonight. Apparently, we are subject to alternative facts and scare tactics. Let me tell you my facts and let you be scared by what I heard from the people that I spoke with. In that letter if you didn't read it it for the benefit of the people here. There are two distinct reasons that I oppose this district. Number one, I am not a longtime Denver resident. I moved from San Francisco seven years ago. I've lived in mostly major U.S. cities. I am exactly the person who is moving to Denver. I moved here and bought a house in that area because it is interesting and because I intended to scrap it and build a modern home on it. If you pass this that intention, the entire reason that I moved into that home will be scrapped because my esthetic does not align with the guidelines I've been given. They are contemporary and there are options, but they are not modern. Make no mistake, that is a fact. The second fact is that I spoke to a developer who calls me regularly about another property I own in District one in the West Colfax District and tries to buy it from me. And I asked him specifically, what would you pay me for? 3221 Osceola knowing that it's in the historic district. The short answer was about $100,000 less than it's worth today. That is a fact. It is a conversation I had. If you choose to disagree with that fact and call it alternative, I can't stop you. If you choose to be scared by that, you stand in my shoes. I understand the reason for history and I appreciate and support many, many of the things being said here. But this is not truthfully what's about what's best for me. Driving through Denver today, I realized that this issue reflects on a small and local scale the problems and challenges that we are currently driving a wedge through this nation. This should be about preserving history in a way that allows people, both current and future, to benefit and learn from the past. It should be a proud moment for neighbors to gather together as a community. It should be a time of celebrating the preservation of beautiful things. But instead, like so many topics across our nation, it has become divisive, hostile and contentious. It has pitted neighbor against neighbor in an escalating battle to show who is more powerful, who has the pull, and who can get their agenda to emerge victorious. It is not about homes or history. Not anymore. If it were, we would have sat down with our councilperson and worked out a marriage arrangement that's best for all community members. We didn't do that. We didn't come together as neighbors to create something that's good for all of us. We did not sit down with unbiased leadership of our councilperson to work through this as an opportunity to become stronger, more cohesive and engaged in this community. Instead, we chose to pursue our own self-interest, whether our personal financial interest, like my own in my letter, our personal political ambitions and loyalties, or increasingly our personal grievances and anger over feeling marginalized and unimportant in the eyes of our neighbors and elected leaders. This is the exact dynamic that is tearing apart this nation. Our self-righteous self-interest and the anger that being selfish creates towards those who threaten to expose it. Tonight, Denver has a chance to show the country that we are stronger together than we are divided, and that in order to remain together, we must work at it. It's hard finding common ground. It's hard to include others. It's hard to think you're going to lose. But then when we fight, we all lose anyway. Approving the issue before. You will not accomplish something great, but rather will drive a permanent and lasting wedge of anger and resentment between the neighbors who stand on opposite sides. So please, Denver City Council. Use this moment not to pass the bill as it stands, but to encourage us as neighbors to unite together as a community, to work together, to reach compromise and to acknowledge that we are different people with differing opinions and that it is this difference that makes us great together. Please vote no. Thank you, Mr. Holderness. And now we have the next five. Folks, please come up here. Renee ou, Kelly Geller, Nilo. Sorry. I may have a misspelling there. Rene Gee, if you'd come up to the front. Mark Brandis. Nancy Chase. Mary Lemieux and Jody Robbins. Great. Renee, you are up first. My name is Renee Kalinga, and I'm a property owner in Osceola, and I very much support the historic designation. I've lived in North Denver for 27 years and I've seen a lot of changes. And I've seen changes impacting senior citizens who live in my neighborhood. Families with children of different ages. And some families that have been second or more generations in the same household. Our neighborhood has a very high degree of historic integrity. 82%. In the variety of home sizes and styles in our neighborhood reflect both the building styles that were available to builders at that time and also the economic up and downs during that time. The different sizes of buildings from modest to elaborate provided a welcome diversity of home sizes, which help provide some variety of price points at which people could come into the neighborhood. As a result, we have some people at all stages of life different family sizes and somewhat different incomes. We really appreciate the diversity of home sizes and we would like to keep that. Unfortunately, whenever a historic home is lost in our area and replaced with something new, the new building is always priced somewhere in or thousand to a million. That only hurts the ability of many people to be able to afford living in our neighborhood and contributes to unaffordability. We really appreciate the diversity of housing stock that we have and believe a store district will contribute to keeping some of that diversity in the future. After 27 years of living there, I've had many opportunities to leave the neighborhood to sell our home. But I and my family know we we stay there because of the neighborhood feel. And we believe that historic designation would help protect the neighborhood feel that has been there for 20 or 27 years. We've been there. Thank you. Knows your vote and support historic district. Thank you, sir. All right, mark. Brenda's. Good evening. My name is Mark Brandis. I live in the district 30 to 49 Osceola Street. My late wife and I bought this property about 26 years ago. It is a Victorian that was built in 1891. It was a four unit apartment building when we bought it, and prior to that it had been converted to a boarding house from a single family and my wife and I converted it back into a single family residence. We have put a lot of time, money, sweat equity into this particular property. My goal in working on this property was to preserve it as a old Victorian. And when I work on the property I keep that in mind and the work that I do tries to bring it back to what it was originally. I feel that a historic designation is inappropriate for this particular area. Unfortunately, I have seen this area go from being very ethnically diverse to very gentrified. My concern is that historic designation will increase that gentrification. It definitely creates more hurdles that individuals have to jump through in order to work on this particular piece of property. With all due respect to my neighbor, as far as landscaping goes, you have to get permission in order to landscape and make changes to your landscape. And that's under the guidelines for preservation of historic structures. 5.1. It is not an easy process. If you want to do anything major, you have to go to your neighborhood association first, then you have to go to Landmark Preservation Committee and then you have to deal with zoning and then you have to hear building and zoning and that increases the time and expense. I do a lot of work on my property, on my own. I work a full time job. I'm an attorney, but I work on my own property. I spent 8 hours this weekend working on my property. I don't need the extra hassle and the extra expense. And quite frankly, I think that a proposed historic designation on this property is really a slap in the face to people like myself who bought into a very, very sketchy neighborhood and have contributed towards the great turnaround that we have in this neighborhood. It's a great place to live. I like my neighbors. Pro and con, either side. And we're still going to be friends no matter how you all vote on this tonight. But I don't believe that it's in our neighborhoods interest to limit what property owners can do with their property. I understand technically it is not a quote unquote taking under the First Amendment pursuant to the Penn Central Station case. But realistically, it's a taking when you're limiting what I can do with my property, when you're telling me what I can do with my landscaping, that I have to maintain a Denver slope instead of putting in a retaining wall when I have to comply with certain rules and regulations for what type of doors and windows I want to put into my structure and where I want to put it into my structure. I think that really invades on my rights as a property owner, and it really just it doesn't give me credit for all of the work that I have put into this particular property. After Brandis, the time is up. Vote no, please. Thank you. All right, Nancy Chase. Nancy Chase. My name is Nancy Chase. And I'm a property owner near the proposed historic district. I live at 4130 Lowe Boulevard for over 35 years. I very much support the Packard Hill historic district. And I thank you for the opportunity to speak. I agree with many of my neighbors. I would like to see this historic area preserved and its history and remembered. Have it remembered and celebrated? It's amazing that we have such a high degree of historic homes and buildings in the North Denver area, and I hope you find this area worthy of protecting. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Miss Chase. All right, Mary Lemieux. Hi. Thank you for letting me speak. I'm Mario Lemieux and I live at 3257. UCLA in the District. I haven't written anything eloquent. I just would like to say that I feel like it's infringing on my rights as a property owner. I've been in the home for 19 years. I bought in a non historic district. We all did. And now it feels like you guys are winning. Or there's people in our neighborhood that are wanting to change the rules on us. I urge you to vote. No, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lemieux. Jody Robbins. Hello. My name is Jody Robbins. I'm a property owner in the district. I live on 3415 Newton Street. I very much support this historic district. Thank you for the opportunity for letting me speak. It is it is highly unusual, especially in northwest Denver, to find a neighborhood like Packard's hill that has entire blocks that are intact or nearly intact. Made up of century old homes maintained in such good condition, as you've heard tonight, are historic. Integrity is 82%. We have two historic districts just to the south of us, south of 32nd between Perry and Irving and reaching south the 29th or 30th and historic district. Just to the south of us, Wolf Place was designated. Its degree of integrity was only 61%. So what we have in Packard Cell is truly amazing. We've lost a few historic homes in the last couple of years, and one or two more may be lost in the near future if our area is not designated. Today, we have a unique opportunity to protect a place that is incredibly special and is in history, architecture, integrity, and with fabulous stories of women pushing the boundaries of their roles in society. Please help us preserve this very special place for all of Denver to enjoy today and in the future. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Mr. ROBINSON. All right. Here we go. Next five, Steve Milk, Betty Luce. Heidi Van Sickle. Elizabeth Clayton. Carol Purdy. Steve Melich, you are up first. Thank you. My name is Steve Milik live at 3257 Oshawa in the proposed district. I've lived at my house for about 20 years. I just learned tonight that it was called Packard Hill. I hadn't heard that before. I am among an abundance of people who take pride in our neighborhood and are good stewards without force. I also learned tonight that we have an 82% integrity without force at all. At the same time, I see disposable highrises going up in this neighborhood that are not historic but always seem to get approval. And if I want to do, say, construct a new garage. I'd have to move mountains. Under the, you know, already more than adequate regulations that exist. I see this is largely pitting neighbors who already have their homes as they want against those that do not or those that simply are against such an overreach on principle. I think this changes the property arrangement that I have with the city against my will, somehow allowing others to infringe on my rights, imposing their preferences and the added costs associated on me and all the others against this overreach. Please vote no on this proposal. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Betty Lewis. Lucy. Good evening. My name is very loose. I live at 2660 mead in Denver, which is my house is about to announce blocks from the district. And I'm a real estate broker with nostalgic homes in our offices in the district right in the corner of 32nd and Newton. The people that founded our company, Tom and Caroline Sinclair, came to the neighborhood in 1985. There was a recession going on in those years. And I'm sure some of you here tonight were. Remember that time? You could have shot a cannon off up 32nd Avenue and you wouldn't have hit anyone. Most of the storefronts. Were not occupied, so there's been great change. They committed themselves to promoting this lovely old neighborhood. There's a. Great love there for his historic. Homes. They are our company over the years. Has helped many, many people move into this neighborhood. And we know why they moved there. They moved there for the ambiance, for the neighborhood. Feeling of the closeness of. Sort of a like a small town where, as people have commented here previously. Many different kinds of people could live. There. Big houses. Small houses. Family houses. Houses for single people. And and be happy there. So I. Speak in favor of approval of this historic district because I think Packard Selah has, as others have mentioned. Great integrity. I think it's important that we save certain parts of our city that remind us of the past and where. People have loved their homes for many, many years. So I would urge you. All to vote. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Heidi Van Sickle. Hi. My name is Heidi Van Sickle and I do not live in the district. I am the first speaker for this group where they've had seven out of district people already. I'm in Councilman Herndon's district and happy happy to be there. But I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry for this neighborhood. This pits neighbor against neighbor like you wouldn't believe. We've seen this in Park Hill where this did not go through, thank God. But we had neighbors who were walking dogs. We had neighbors who were hiking and they no longer speak to each other. All right. The point that was for me important was the solar panels. Now I have mine, which saved me about 1500 dollars a year. That's pretty significant amount of cash, especially for the low income neighbors. But the pro historic people would not allow that kind of savings to their neighbors or savings to the community or to the atmosphere itself. The historic Denver allowed review of solar panels in 2013. They allowed that into that big, thick manual of theirs. But you call them and you ask them how many of these solar panels have gone through since 2011, in the last seven years, and they say zero, none of the solar panels have been allowed to go through. I don't believe that historic Denver is an honest broker in these dealings. The cost is more. The windows that you want to replace will be three times the cost than if you wanted to replace them. Without a historic designation. The time is more, but there is a better way. Councilman Herndon had the foresight to see how devastating this is. And now we are talking about a conservation overlay. There's three of us, three of the stop historic, three of the pro historic. And we are meeting consistently with a council designated moderator through Council for Conservation Overlays. It is a better way. I strongly suggest that the Council vote no so that these neighbors can find another way, a better way. They can remove this hostile wedge and they can begin to be the neighbors together again. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Miss Francisco. Elizabeth Clayton. I'm Elizabeth Clayton and I work at Nostalgic Homes at 32nd. And Newton. We are in the district in the proposed district. I've been a real estate agent there for 23 years. We help people buy and sell homes in Denver County. I would say 90% of our business is in this very neighborhood. I can't tell you how fortunate we are in Denver to have the intact. Inner city. Neighborhoods that are so close to downtown that doesn't. Exist in every city. And. Being in a historic district actually adds quite a bit of value to your home, even though people don't even know it's a historic district when they're looking. They're looking for the consistency and the character and the architecture. That's what they're looking for. And it really does add value. So as a real estate agent working in that neighborhood, I would like to encourage you to approve this historic district. Thank you. Ms.. Clayton. Carol Purdy. Hello. My name is Carol Purdy. I live at 3715 West 32nd Avenue. Within the district. Thank you for this opportunity to tell you about my opposition to designating my neighborhood as a historic district. I bought my property because it was dual zoned, both commercial and residential. I would like to start a small business on my property right on West 32nd Avenue in the heart of the Highlands. Unfortunately, the historic designation is arbitrary and unfair. My commercial neighbors down the street, down the block have been exempted from the district while my property has not. If the ordinance is passed for me to undertake a renovation to convert my property to a commercial business would be prohibitively expensive. I strongly urge you to vote no on this ordinance. Thank you. All right. Next five are up, Shaman. Sather. Melissa Ortega. Linda Hilton. Ileana Kreisky. And Julianne Moore. After. Julianne Moore. Sherman Sather. Okay. I'll check the monitor. First to make sure that I'm the right person. Right? Yes. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Okay. Chairman Sekou. I mean, Sherman Sather. Okay. You're up. The reason I'm here. Is because I live in the Ghost Historic District at 3317 West 30th Avenue. And when we went up for historic designation about I guess it's been three or four years ago, I was the naysayer. I was against it. We weren't going to have an I did not want an HRA in this neighborhood that I had lived in for 30 some years. And so I made it known to everybody, of course, that I was against it. Well, it passed, and I'm no longer against it. It was a good thing that happened. And I don't know what happened, but I still have friends there. I don't know where the contentiousness was. Nobody seems to be that mad at me because of that at least. Could be other things. But. I think that those there will be a lot of people if this passes, which I hope it does, I think there will be a lot of people in hindsight that will say, you know what? It's not as bad as we thought it was going to be. And it hasn't been that bad. Thank you. Please vote for the historic district. Thank you, I think. Thank you, Ms.. You're welcome. Melissa Ortega. Hello. I'm Melissa Ortega, and I live at 3295 Mead Street. I am against this historic district. I am a Colorado native. I have grown up in North Denver and my entire. Life I have recently. Decided to move back and have purchased this home. Now you guys are trying to tell me that there is a possibility that I am going to have to keep my 100 square foot house that fits no family in today's standards. And I'm not going to be my type. I'm not going to be able to scrape. I have no options. And you guys are going to dictate that this historic district what if I wanted somebody to tell me what I could or couldn't do with my house? I will live in the suburbs. I moved to Highlands Ranch. I'd have in a way I don't want that. I want to do what I want with my house. I want to enjoy this neighborhood that I have seen grow tremendously over. The years. When it was low income to up and rising again. We have apartment buildings popping up off of 32nd. But you're telling me I can't put a simple pop top on my house to make my 800 square foot home built in 1926? Meet Today's Standards in my family. We're also talking I've heard several things tonight. It's like how many of you actually live in our district? How many of you have. Tried to repair. Your home recently? Have you seen the costs go up, the new construction? Everything that's plugging into our city is taking effect. And if we make this historic because nobody is going to be able to pay for it, I don't care what anybody has said tonight, it's like, show me the last time you have spent money and have tried to do this. I am in real estate. I have again grown up Denver my whole life like. Changes are happening. Denver re zoned for changes to happen and now rezoning has happened. Things are popping up. Things are being scraped and people want to stop that. You're trying to make me live in a house full of a specialist led. Based paint who knows other toxics. Because it was historic 100 years ago. It got built. Standards aren't the. Same. I just really wish that you guys would take into consideration the growing families that are trying to move into this neighborhood. If I can't do what I'm going want to do to my house, it will become a rental. And then nobody will be contributing to that neighborhood. And that's something you guys will force to happen. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. Ortega. Linda Hilton. Hello, I'm Linda Hilton, and I'm a property owner within the proposed district. I live at 3440 Osceola Street, and I'm the proud owner of a 1910 classic cottage, the one that has all the flowers. Around it for any of. You who went on our tour. I moved. I bought that house 23 years ago. But even back then, I felt that I was just and still. Feel that I'm the temporary caretaker of this. Historic home. My mom was really worried that I was buying an older home and it really has was still withstood the test of time. I agree with that. We really should. Spend our money not putting everything into the landfill and restoring these homes. I love the historic homes in my neighborhood. I mean, I'll be perfectly honest. I mean, I'm stand before you because I love these old homes and I want to keep them. I don't mind them being the tops being popped. And I've seen some really nice ones for those people who say, you can't be done, we can be. But I was going to speak on the historic women in our neighborhood that contributed so much to to Colorado and in Denver, but that was highlighted with. The staff presentation. So I won't go into that. I feel proud to live in a city that that will even let us have hearings like this that. Has a preservation group on the staff that that that allows. Us the time. And you to consider having these historic districts in in our city. I think that's what makes Denver great. And I would like to see our. Just little two. By four block neighborhood, you know, added to the to the wonderful historic preservation efforts that the city. Has so wonderfully spent their time. Making sure happen. So please, please vote for this. I want to also preserve my wonderful neighborhood. Thank you for listening to me. Thank you, Ms.. Hilton. Ileana Kreisky. Excuse keys. My wife. Oh, but she had to go. Oh. Are you signed up to speak? Are you signed up to speak? Okay. We're going to have to wait till I call on you, if that's okay. Thank you, sir. All right. Julianne Moore. She left. Okay. I'm going to call the next five mark. Matt Macaluso. Macaluso Sorry. Macaluso. Mark Macaluso. Jacquie Youngblood. Jeff Snell. Kick, Mason. Zoe. Zo'or. All right, Mark. You're up first 3 minutes. Hey. My name's Mark Macaluso. I live my property at 3400 Newton Street. I am opposed to the district. I. I purchased my property two years ago and I moved to the neighborhood based on the friendly, peaceful atmosphere and and the friendly people. The house was an old and dilapidated boardinghouse rundown. I proceeded to scrape the property and build a duplex on the property. I did. Throughout the process, I received a lot of positive feedback, tremendous support. Everybody was very, very nice. I feel like the end product was a very esthetically pleasing. It's modern. It's new. I, I sold half of the duplex to a couple who again are very keen. Speaking of contributing properties are very, very much a contributing member of members of our society. They pay taxes. They do very well. I think over the last you know, as you guys know in Denver, we've seen tremendous growth. We want good quality people coming to our place of neighborhood. I think what makes our our city great and our neighborhood great is the diversity among the people. I've met some of the pro historic people, and they're very nice people as well as are the people that are against it. I think what has been happening throughout this whole process is tremendous discord, discord and and contention. And it's sad to see that because our neighborhood is divided now. And that's not why I moved to the neighborhood. And it's it's sad that we've that we've let it come to this point. I feel like we can create a solution that satisfies everybody. We don't have to have that pendulum swing all the way from one side to the other. We can find a solution somewhere that makes everybody happy with design, guidelines, overlay, whatever it is. We just need to have that opportunity. I don't think we've had that opportunity through this process. It's been sort of shoved down us and now we've now you see the result. I think if you see all the people, again, it's it's it's almost it's almost the same right down the middle. So I think the proof is in that. So I don't think you can rubber stamp anything at this point because the people have spoken, the people have showed you that, you know, we were willing to work with it. There are good people on both sides of the aisle here. We just need to let that process play out. We don't need to rush this in. I can tell you that from my standpoint, it's not a quick process to develop and scrape a house. It's taken two years to do that so people aren't going to be rushing to the neighborhood as soon as this meeting is over to be developing. If you guys vote no, that's not going to happen. The House is here with don't warrant that. I can tell you from a development perspective, to buy one of these style houses is not prohibitive. Description. You're right. You're out of time. Thank you. Thank you. Jackie Youngblood. Thank you. My name is Jackie. I'm what? I live at 2975 Irving Street. I'm very much in support of this historic district. And thank you for the opportunity this week. I live in the nearby Ghost Historic District and I wanted to share some of my and my neighbors observations and experiences living in a historic district. I have lived there since 2000. And we became a historic district in August 2010. It has been a very positive experience. I would not want to live in any other area in Denver that is not designated a historic district. Historic districts are a win win for property owners. They allow us to welcome new development that complements and enhances the existing character. They are the best means available to ensure the old and new can co-exist harmoniously. Also, I found during our designation that even those neighbors who were concerned or even opposed when our district was created are now solidly in favor because they have seen the benefits of development that fits in and are able to expand, adapt and modernize their homes. As you know, state tax credits, credits of up to $50,000 are also available. For some projects. I also want to share what of what the Johnson family said that live in the wolf historic district. We feel that the benefits of living with the historic, historic district outweigh the drawbacks, in particular due to our own experience and working with the West Highlands Neighborhood Association Wina. We have recently gone through the design review process and we are pleased with the outcome in support of the Design and Preservation Committee. I particular project was met with some unique obstacles, but thanks to the witness support and guidance, we feel the project will create a home that will accommodate the needs of our growing family without diminishing the area's historic charm or adversely impacted our neighbors. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Michelle Black, Jeff Snell. Good evening. My name is Jeff Snell, and my wife and I live at 3339 Loeb Boulevard for 20 years and of August. I don't want to repeat myself either. We're all here to wait. I do want to bring up that one size doesn't fit all. We have one of the few triple lots in the neighborhood, and the house is roughly 1880. It's wood, one of the few. And still standing is kind of a miracle. But the foundation is brick. I can tell you that brick does not last forever. My brick is 130 years old, and I could crush it in my hand. It's. It's a problem that I realize in probably 15 years the House will have to go because the center of the house where the basement is, I couldn't really economically replace that brick. So I painstakingly replace the whole foundation around the stem walls of concrete. But it's it's a Band-Aid. Okay, so our house sits catty rumpus in the back of the lot. I think when we got done remodeling it six years worth of work, it turned out pretty good. But when the time comes, it's going to fall down. So when I bought it, it was our too. I could put a nice good sized duplex on it. It's probably going to be my retirement or my wife's. So with the restrictions that I'm hearing about that are coming my way. I tell you, I don't know how anyone can say I'm not going to lose money on this. My options are a lot more limited than they were before this. So I just ask you to vote no. There's got to be a better way. I'd love to get out of this. And there's some other folks that agree. So thanks. Yeah. Thank you, Miss Snell, Casey Mason. Good evening. Thank you for this opportunity to. Speak on behalf of historic designation for what I. Hope will become the Packard's Hill neighborhood. As a career journalist, I will. Follow the who, what. Why, how and when formula in my remarks. Who my name is Catherine, also known as Casey Mason and I have. Owned and lived in the duplex at 3300 Dash 3308. Newton, which is in the District since 1977, I believe I am one of the longest non. Absentee owners and the two block. Stretch of Newton between 33rd and 35th. What? I am here to encourage your vote for historic designation. I've been an active volunteer attending meetings, knocking on doors, emailing and visiting with people as they walk their children and or their dogs past my corner lot. And I would like to add that I have never experienced any of the hostility from anyone in all of this time. Why I was. Attracted to the neighborhood 40 years ago by its tree lined streets and the middle class mixture of brick bungalows, Tudors, Queen Anne Mansions and Denver squares. It reminded me of. Where I grew up in historic. Las Vegas, New Mexico. After spending seven years in the apartment complexes of. Glendale. Capitol. Hill and East Monaco, I found my sense of place in North Denver. It became home and remains so to this day. One of the first books I bought was Rediscovering Northwest Denver by Ruth Weisberg. Visitors frequently have to endure a presentation of my hood's early Denver history. The dot com boom of the 1990s brought in new owners who restored many homes that had. Been allowed to deteriorate. By absentee landlords. The 32nd straight commercial area morphed into several blocks of coffeehouses, trendy restaurants, boutiques and specialty shops. The old buildings were not destroyed. They were renovated to fit in with the character of the existing neighborhood. How I believe historic designation is the. Best way to bring stability to the place I call. Home. I do not believe it will prevent further improvements or development. In fact, statistics indicate property. Values go up because people are attracted to historic. Districts and are willing to invest in them. Several years ago, I sold a vacant. Lot at the north end of my property at lower than market price. Because the buyer. Slash contractor. Was willing to. Work with me on what got built. The result was a beautiful new. Craftsman bungalow that I'm told already meets the requirements of historic designation. When now is the time to act? I would like to close by. Relating a recent conversation I had with two girls, probably 10 to 12 years old, who saw a television news crew and asked me what was going on. I explained historic preservation to them and asked what they thought of their effort. Of our effort while they both live. Outside, just outside. The district. They each said they were glad they lived in homes. One with a big new addition set the space for them with the rest of the neighborhood. I wish I could have brought them to this meeting. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Zoe Zuber. Zucca are we miss the K there? Sorry, but that's okay. I blame my horrific handwriting. Okay, go ahead. Hi, I'm Zoe Zucker, live at 3278 Newton Street, which is in the proposed historic district. And Jean and I have been owners of that property for almost five months. We are some of the newest owners in the area, I think and I'm sorry, I don't have a speech prepared tonight. I hope you don't find that to be disrespectful at all. I certainly didn't mean it that way. I just wanted to be able to hear what my neighbors had to say, because a lot of what I've been hearing is actually a lot of talk about community. My mother wrote actually her dissertation on community. And I have to say, I'm a little bit disappointed in mine. My new community anyway. Nine. That's the total number of neighbors that I can recall in the past five months that have actually knocked on our door, introduced themselves. Tell us a little bit about the neighborhood. I had no idea that the neighborhood was going to start going, excuse me, historic until neighbor number seven knocked on my door and asked me to vote pro. I had no idea what that meant and I just went, Cool, thanks. Let me read the paperwork as I do with most things, so I never sign on the dotted line until I read everything through. Thanks, Dad. And then I started doing my homework. And what I found out was other friends of mine who actually do own properties in different historic districts around Denver have nothing but complaints, unfortunately, and many of them have vacated those properties and turn them into rentals. So not only are is the idea of community disintegrating before their eyes, they don't even want to live there anymore. Some of them have sold because they couldn't do anything to their house and the amount of effort and cost that went into just getting their proposal to a point where the architect or excuse me, the contractor could submit to get a permit, it was so overwhelming. And then to be turned down, the next thing you did was put the house on the market and they ended up losing money on the sale. If somebody had come to my door within the first five months of us living there and told me a bit more about the actual historic. Amazing, wonderful things that have. Happened within our neighborhood that may have changed my mind. If more than know, six neighbors have knocked on my door and wanted to introduce themselves. Me bring over a pie invited to a barbecue, something along those lines. I might believe that this has something to do with community, but unfortunately I don't. So yeah, my neighbors, if you have something you want me to change on my house or something you disagree with me doing. My door's open. Three, two, seven, eight. Newton Thanks. Thank you. Ms.. Zucker. Okay, I'm going to call the next five folks up there. We are at the halfway point. And so I think I think we've we've done pretty well. I just want to remind folks that now we've really heard from half of you. And so if there's some new information, please share. If not, you know, be considerate of your time. Laurie Simmons upfront. Jean all day. Michelle Meyer. Megan. Winger. And okay. Jarrett O'Hare. One, two, three. Or and let's do one more. Do we do winter? Yeah, we did winter. Sheila. Oh, Ranger, this is. But you didn't. Oh. Oh, yeah. Is Bo Ninja here? Okay. Hey, there we go. Okay. There we go. We are ready to go. Laurie Simmons. Hello. I'm Laurie Simmons. I'm a 30 year resident of Denver's Berkeley neighborhood. I'm also a historian and the coauthor of this landmark application. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you tonight in support of this historic district. As Denver historian Marsha Goldstein wrote 15 years ago, our city's historical record has often neglected women. Early histories recorded the story of men that overlooked early female, Denver writes. I would like to ask you one question. How many 19th century Denver women doctors can you name? Two lived in Packard Hill, Dr. Mary Ford and Dr. Helene Byington. Their house stands at 32. 25. Sorry, 38. 25. West 32nd Avenue. When I asked that question of you, maybe some of you thought of dirt doctor just, you know, Ford. She received her Colorado medical license in 1902. Well, Dr. Mary Ford moved to Denver and began began her practice in 1880. Ms.. Simmons put that mike down just a little bit. Some folks can't hear you. Okay? There's no better. Perfect. Okay. An African-American doctor just in his Ford's remarkable career was some in some ways similar to Dr. Mary Ford, who lived in Packard Hill. Both were known in their neighborhoods for treating thousands of patients during their time when there were few women doctors to be had in Denver. Dr. Mary Ford also operated a small sanatorium in her home and was quite active in activities to expand opportunities and rights for women. Dr. Mary Ford died in 1951 and Dr. Justino Ford in 1952. So why do we remember Dr. Justin Ford's name more than Dr. Mary Ford's name in 1982, when faced with redevelopment of the block where Dr. Justino Ford's house stood, local residents with the assistance of the developer and historic Denver were able to save the building, which is now part of the Curtis Park Historic District. It is known as the Black American West Museum today and is an important reminder of the life of Dr. Justinian Ford. I'm sure we've all had the experience of having a familiar landmark in our life, and then it goes away and we can't remember what was there. A few years ago, Dr. Mary Ford's house was threatened with demolition, which was avoided with the help of historic Denver. The current owner of the house is extremely supportive of this historic district application. Simmons I'm sorry. Your time is up. Oh. That was quick. Yeah, it goes it goes fast. Thank you. Thank you, Jean. All day. Jean all day. All right. Michelle Meyer. Good evening. Can you hear me okay? Yeah. Okay. Thank you guys so much for being here. I know it's a really long night and there's a lot of voices to be heard, but I just want to start off. By thanking you guys. My name is Michelle Meyer. I live at 3280 Osceola. And I am in support of this historic district. I can't tell you the number of times that my friends and family and I'm sure all of you, each of you has has visited our cute neighborhood and seen the charm that we all share and feel about it. So I live in a cute 1908 Craftsman style home, and in our neighborhood you can also find the Queen Anne Homes, which you just aren't seeing. Being. Built today. Anymore. And it's unfortunate and it's just such a special place. It's so fun to meet my neighbors and walk the dog and see the beautiful homes that we appreciate from that were built so long ago. And all my friends are visiting and they can just they come and they eat dinner. With me and they go out with me in the neighborhood. And it supports our economy. And also, it's been a very fun process, just learning about the history that Lawry's just shared with. Us and even my coworkers. She always talks about how her dad was part of the Italian mafia, which is interesting, but it's just fun to hear about that stuff. And I feel like the buildings and the residents that we all share. They're what grounds our. History and what. Keeps it alive today. And it's very special. And I urge you all to please keep that in mind and vote for the historic district. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Meyer. Megan Winger's not here. Right. Okay, great. Um, you're at O'Hare. Our. Hi. Good evening. Like a lot of folks in the room, I'm an import. I moved here. To say your name for. The record. Gerard O'Hare, 3416 Meat in the District. I also own the house next door, which is 3400 MEADE Both in the district. Like a lot of folks in the room, I moved here. My wife grew up in North Denver, went to North High School. So I'm well aware of the fact that there are more than just architectural changes going on on the north side. I suspect most people don't even call it the north side anymore, but I've been there since the early nineties. Bought a house in 91 on Main Street and. When I needed more room, I built a small extension on the back. When I needed even more room, I dug down. So there are six houses on my block. Five are small, pretty attractive brick Victorians. The sixth house which I bought. For my own preservation and my own protection is a relatively ugly 1960s yellow brick, one storey bungalow right next door. It breaks up the whole flow of the block. I bought that for obvious reasons. I bought that because I don't want another monster home beside me. And I know we don't want to talk about this stuff, but I don't. And I took steps to preserve my investment by building down and building back. My house looks the same now as it did the day it was built in 1910. And I won't sell that rental next door for a profit or. A loss until I know that it won't screw up my whole block. It won't block my neighbor's sunlight. Hi, Michelle. We're still neighbors, you know, so I've taken steps to preserve the neighborhood because it's not my job to change the neighborhood. I moved to the neighborhood, and I'm trying to fit in with what was there. Thanks. All right. Thank you, Mr. O'Hare. Bo, when you. My name is. Bonita. I live at 3300 an hour. About that. Oh, no problem. I live at 3300 Osceola Street. We bought the house 15 years ago. I'd like to just tell our story because this process has already had a direct effect on us before this has occurred. My my wife and I have been planning and designing our home the entire time we've lived in our property for the past two years. We've worked with architecture firms and engineers to put those plans in motion. So we've already spent a great deal of money. So our current plans of our our home would be disallowed by the landmark the landmark designation specifically because of the step backs the 15 foot step back. We plan to add a story to our home. Our home is a 1938 Tudor, has a small footprint which effectively reduces the square footage that we need for our family. So this whole process, since we are well long on the way with our design plans, we've had to fast track this thing to be on a timeline imposed upon us versus our own timelines of saving money for literally 15 years. So we did get the permit into the permit desk. So regardless of the outcome of this vote, we're building our house that we've dreamed upon. But I'm sharing my story because there's other families just like me that are not here to build monstrosities. They're simply trying to modify their home to best suit their needs and their design tastes. So I ask you to vote no on the Packard Hill. And lastly, I don't think this is should be a yes no decision. This is putting us all in an awkward position. There's got to be a better way to come together and make a compromise. So vote no. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Sheila Bee. Czapski. Czapski. Nice. Good evening. I'm going to read my own statement and then follow up with the statement of a neighbor who couldn't be here tonight. Hello. My name is Sheila Pilarski. I live at 3350 West 36th Avenue near the intersection of 36th and Julian, just two and a half blocks from the district. As a resident of Denver for 23 years and a homeowner in West Highland for the past 20 years, I support designation of Packard Hill as a historic district. If my home was within the proposed district, I would be just as enthusiastic about this effort. The charming, historic homes in the area were what compelled me to buy my home 20 years ago in West Highland. Over the years, I have seen too many charming old homes, classic bungalows, Denver squares, Tudors and Victorians, among them scraped and replaced by multifamily multi-story structures. Our city is growing rapidly, and I agree that densification needs to happen where appropriate, especially within the inner city core. But let's preserve the unique character of our outlying neighborhoods while we still can for future generations to enjoy. Please vote yes to establish the historic district for Packard Hill. A supporter of Packard Hill is teaching a class tonight and could not be here but asked that I read his comments. Dear Council members, my name is Phillip Joseph. I have lived at 33, 95, West 31st Avenue with my wife and three children for 14 years. As a resident of West Highland and the Ghost Historic District, I support designation of Packard Hill as a as an historic district. Originally, my wife and I opposed creation of the Ghost District because we felt it would stifle change in the neighborhood that we'd be living in a museum. That fear turned out to be unfounded. Shortly after the district was created, we did a major addition to our home to accommodate our growing family. We had no problem with the design review process, and being in the historic district did not add to the cost of the addition. In fact, we were able to find an architect and local contractor who because they were both sympathetic with our goals and familiar with building in a historic neighborhood like ours, they were able and willing to work with us in keeping costs down. In this way, designation of historic preservation status helped foster the growth of very local businesses. I'd like to reassure opponents of the Packers Hill area and members of the council that the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission seems prepared to balance change with preservation of Denver's special historic areas. Thank you for your consideration of this request and for your vote to establish the historic district. Thank you, Mrs. BoSox. Ski. All right, Tony. I'm going to call the next five up. Tony, Julian, Nellie, Phil Alonzo, Matt McLain, Joan Bolduc and Caroline Snell. Tony, you are up first. You have 6 minutes. Fantastic. President Brooks and council members, thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Tony Giuliano. I live at 3310 Newton Street in the proposed district. Friends, I'm here to speak in opposition to the Packard Hill historic district. First, I'd like to acknowledge there are fantastic people on both sides of this issue. Neighbors and friends, there is a danger that this will be divisive in our neighborhood. And I'd like to admonish each of us who have an opinion, either for or against, to remain committed to hospitality and to neighborly affection for one another. I'm opposed to the historic district for the following reasons. First, there's clearly not consensus. An agreement in our neighborhood. As you can see here tonight, there are many for and many against. Changing the status quo of our neighborhood should be done in cooperation with all sides of this discussion. At the last hearing I attended the Landmark Preservation Committee. It was surprising to me to hear that more than a few of the people who spoke in support of the district do not actually live within its boundaries. I don't know if I'm counting accurately, but it's at least 13 tonight. Second, there is evidence that historic districts can have an adverse impact on minority homeowners. My family is multiethnic and we moved to the neighborhood because of its rich ethnic history. As a sidebar here, it should not go unaddressed that during the rationale presented for this historic district, it was necessary for the presenter to mention a previous mayor's active engagement with the Ku Klux Klan. This is disturbing. Progressive cities like Minneapolis are renaming landmarks like Lake Calhoun based on the connection to systemic racism and white supremacy. Why would we allow our rationale for this district to include this clan member? One of the selling points from proponents is that this will increase property values. We've heard that multiple times. This has been shown over and over again to make it more difficult for lower and middle income families to stay in their homes. It will not. I will not make any assumptions about the intentions of anyone in favor of this, but will conclude that there is insufficient understanding of the impact on families and homeowners who those with more resources should be working to protect. If there is a possibility that this will accelerate the gentrification of the neighborhood, that should be thoroughly researched and thoroughly understood by this Council before taking any action. Our neighborhood needs more young families. If you read more, or if you remove or make more onerous the opportunity for a growing family to add space to their home. These families will be less likely to live here, as you've heard several say tonight. Fourth, I love the historic architecture neighborhood in my home while built in 27 is a classic looking home. So thank you to Casey Mason, who made sure that was the case. I also appreciate progress and the diversity of taste and opinion about what makes a home beautiful. This historic district may may well impede progress and diversity. Those in favor of said that infill construction will still happen. But at public hearing, I asked specifically if a contributing home could be demolished, if it was in extreme disrepair and was told no. If 82% of the neighborhood is contributing, this will essentially end infill development in our neighborhood. Finally, the historic district will create financial harm for some and cause highest and best use to be ignored. For example, I purchased a home in the neighborhood that would be considered contributing. It has substantial issues that would make it a much better candidate for a scrape where a high quality home could be built that was suitable for a family. If this passes tonight. They will remove the option for me and require me to either sell the home now likely at a discount based on this, or to invest substantial personal resources to renovate a home that should not be renovated. It has no actual historical value other than the fact that it is old. I would ask this Council to, in light of the strong opposition and lack of neighborhood consensus, to reject this proposal. It's unsettling that there are so many here speaking for this that aren't impacted by it. I would also ask the Council to provide meaningful leadership and bring organizers on both sides of this issue together to work toward another resolution that takes into account the needs and desires of all in our neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Giuliani. All right, feel Alonzo. All right. Matt Mulally. Molly. Yes. There you go. Sorry about that. Hi. My name is Matt McClain. I live at. 3270 Mead Street in the proposed historic. District. And may I ask that of all who were here that oppose the Packard Hill historic district to stand up so they may see the numbers in opposition. Thank you. My wife and I oppose the proposed historic district. The historic landmark guidelines create another layer of bureaucracy, creates more hurdles and adds time and money to exterior modification projects. These guidelines severely limit what single story homeowners can do to modify their homes by requiring homes to maintain the front 15 feet. The streetscape is maintained only if the onlooker cannot see beyond that front 15 feet. The guidelines create bad architecture for those who want to pop the top of a single storey structure. They also force single storey structures to use more of their already small yards to get the same square foot footage as if they were allowed to use the front 15 feet of their house in that pop up. Unfortunately, the historic application process has created division in our neighborhood that wasn't there before. My wife and I just want to live in an area that homeowners homeowners can do what they want with their property architecturally and within current city zoning guidelines without someone else telling them what it should look like. Thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you, Mr. McLain. John Bolduc. Hello. My name is Joan Bolder. And once you prove it in West Highlands District one and I've lived at 3033 Yates for 32 years. I very much support this historic district, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. I was going to talk about the women involved in this period of significance, but Laura or Lori already talked a little bit about it, and Kara talked about it, too. There are artists. There are writers. There's actors, actresses. Community involvement people. Some pretty gutsy women. And I just would like to make the point that Packard Hill still has gutsy women on both sides, and you guys are witnessing that. But one of the things I really wanted to make is everybody seems to think that, you know, a historic district, you know, if it's a mansion of a lumber baron or, you know, a mining tycoon, that that's worthy of saving. But that only tells part of the city's story. Packard Hills talks about the working class and the middle class of a trolley neighborhood. And that's a part of the story that our historic districts kind of sometimes don't really look at. So I want to make that important point, and I urge you to vote yes for the historic district. Thank you, Mr. Product. Caroline Snowe. My name is Carolyn Snell, and I live at 3339 Lowell Boulevard with my husband Jeff. And we happen to live in a home that is considered non contributing even though it was circa 1880. And so we would not have the benefit of the tax credits if we wanted to make improvements to our home. So that is totally unfair and. I've been very engaged in this process since I learned about it in May of 2015 when I was reading the West Highland Neighborhood Association minutes of the Design and Preservation Committee, and learned at that point that they had already been discussing this and working on this for 18 months, but never had the courtesy to leave us a note to try to reach us by phone or email, anything to ask anyone that I know our opinion or for our input, including the name of the district which I intensely dislike. So you would think they would at least have the courtesy to let us choose our own name if they're going to force this on us. So I have that has been bothering me since 2015, and I tried to stay open minded about it, even though I was upset from the very beginning that nobody had the courtesy to discuss this with us. So I went to all of the meetings which were not meetings. They were presentations that were where questions and answers were very managed. We had to write our questions on index cards and someone would rifle through them and choose which questions would be asked and answered. It was not a forum. It was not a meeting. It was a presentation. So I even decided to go on one of their walking tours and at that point was so engaged that and trying to keep an open mind that one of the co-chairs of the Design and Preservation Committee even asked if my husband and I would host the reception following the walking tour. So I really did try to keep an open mind about this the whole time. But where they last me on this walking tour. What's when we walk by to old. Basically brick square little boxes that would be like living in a pizza oven in the summertime. Their only historical significance was that they were built by World War Two veterans returning after the war. And I just feel like this is a farce that they're picking and choosing these obscure historical details. And I. Think there would be a lot better. Ways to honor our veterans than these. Two little houses, that it would be an improvement to replace them with something bigger and more energy efficient that families could grow up in. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, Ms.. Snell. Okay, Stephanie. Okay, well, we got a whole new group. That's right. Here we go. You all can be seated. Stephanie Burke. Awesome. Your first step. Jessica Alasdair is next. Stephanie Gold Hammer. Nick Bertrand and Fran Trujillo. Stephanie. 3 minutes. We'll see if this works. Hi. My name is Stephanie Bourg Oram. I am a resident and property owner at 3230 Newton Street in the proposed district. And I support designating Packard's Hill a historic district. I've lived here for over 27 years now. I actually married into the neighborhood, and I have to admit that his Queen and Painted Lady was a positive attribute in in my now husband. Historically, Packard Hill is a working and middle class neighborhood with a high number of. Houses that have been owned by women. People move here because they like the character of the place. The pleasing appearance, as well as the nice neighbors. There's a very high historic integrity, which is what really appeals to me. 82% are contributing structures. That display Denver's. Architectural evolution from 1890 to 1940. It's quite a variety of styles. Queen Anne's Classic. Cottages, Bungalows, Denver Squares, terraces. A few others. Some are. A few are fairly ornate. Especially those built before the Silver Panic of. 1893. Later ones are rather more modest. There is a variety of sizes one story all the way up to substantial to two and a half stories. There are narrow lots or extended lots or even doubles. 16 are. Duplexes. One's a triplex. Most are single family. Most of them are brick. And the high quality of workmanship really. Promises them to endure as well. There are exceptions, but mostly they endure. Yes, they are middle class and worth preserving for that very reason. The high degree. Of integrity is a special and almost unique aspect of the neighborhood. That's hard to find today. In Denver. And very easy to lose in the growth that we are currently seeing. Our intact 100 year old neighborhood and its history deserve keeping the middle class. People who built Denver are worth honoring. As are the women who found. Their opportunity here. I hope you find. Our area worthy of designation under. The Denver landmark criteria. I urge you. To help us preserve this special part of Denver. Please vote yes to make. Packard's Hill a historic district. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. All right, Jessica, let's. Good evening. Members of Council Jessica. Leads at a Fairfield in Woods. 1801 California, Suite 2600 on behalf of Keep West Highlands Free. I'd like to begin just by committing to the record the. Biased nature of the the landmark process. Your staff. Works very hard to. Review applications against the the criteria as it sits within your. Code, but your. Code is broken. And it. Consistently and this is not my first time for you results. In the city. Advocating. For one neighbor against another, and it's never been clearer than it is. Here this evening. It overlooks also the powerful. Filter. That landmark plays in the information that you. Receive. So there are a number of letters that, for. Whatever reason, have been emitted consistently through the record. I believe along the process, many of you have received them. They have not made their way into the record. And this is significant. Because Section. 30 Dash four of your code requires that due consideration. Shall be given to the written views. Of affected properties. So in designating. An entire swath of. Homes against the will of over 75 homeowners. Think about that. That is 75 gyms. Those are 75. Judith Batiste's 75. If you were. To solely apply the criteria this we'd. Be over. At Landmark. We'd be done. But you are called on. To consider the totality of the public. Impacts and what this. Policy means for our city when we pit neighbor against neighbor. You all work very hard with your constituents to navigate very contentious issues on a daily basis. I know that historic districts should not be one of them and not at this point in the process. I sat here the night that your Virginia village, 95% of the homeowners in Virginia Village supported that historic designation by the district. By the time it got to you, there was a lot of work that was done first. So there are many options and those options. Maintain the character of the neighborhood. But they've been dismissed very early on in this process, and we would urge you to let the neighbors go back and work through those options. Lastly, there have been mentions about Supreme Court cases. And the Supreme Court also found in Keeler. Versus the city of New London that eminent domain of 14 homes. And giving that property. To the municipality was also legal. But that doesn't mean that's the right policy for Denver. So I urge you to vote no. Thank you very. Much. Thank you. All right. Stephanie Goldhammer. Hello. My name is Stephanie Goldhammer and I live at West Highlands Neighborhood at 3027 Gage Street. I'm a real estate broker with Remax Alliance, and I had been in the real estate industry since 2001. I am here to support the Packers Hill Historic District. I would like to clarify one misperception that you have already heard and we'll probably hear again tonight, and that is the claim, the false claim that property values will decrease if the historic district is approved. Statistically, if you look at the data for the sold properties in the two historic districts already in existence in the West Highlands neighborhood, the Allen and Ghost and the Wolf Place historic districts, the numbers show that the average sale price per square foot for properties within the historic districts are higher than those homes adjacent to these districts. Homes in the ghost districts sold an average of 409 per square foot, compared with homes outside the district that sold at four four per square foot homes in the Wolf Place, sold at 405 per square foot with the surrounding homes outside that district sold for 398 per square foot. Numbers don't lie. Prices within historic districts tend to be. Slightly higher than in adjacent areas. These findings are consistent with previous local comparisons, as well as local and national research. This suggests that while property values won't dramatically increase, creating the historic district will at least stabilize property values and certainly will not. Decrease. Values. Thank you for your time and your support. Thank you, Goldhammer. Nick Bertrand. I am Nick Bertrand, and I'm in the zone at 3290 Mead Street. I originally signed the proposal to make the neighborhood historic. However, I have changed my mind for many reasons described today. Once this is approved, there's no going back. We're stuck with what's here. I'm also shocked that there's 14 people that are for. A. Peruvian historic district that have spoke today that don't even live in the district. Several years ago. Seven years ago. Exact, I guess we purchased our home and I'm sorry, I'm going to try to be quick and I'd rather just talk instead of reading this. You know, we purchased our home seven years ago. We had no children. Home was awesome. Looking back at some photos, it was awesome. There's no clutter, there's no toys. There's so much room. And like many people on this side of the room that I swear are not Chiefs fans, are really Broncos fans. Honestly, it's one of those things where the neighborhood just drove us to the neighborhood. We looked at 32nd Street. I don't think the neighborhood of the actual homes is quite what did it. It was the actual people. It was the stores. It was the atmosphere. You know, it's something over the last couple of years after having a child, you realize that there is so much stuff. And unfortunately, a lot of these homes that we're talking about today don't have the amenities that we need today. Over the last couple of years, we've looked at possibly moving out of the city. And honestly, we don't want to. We love our neighbors. Chris, who likes to have the 5:00 drink on Friday and Saturday, who is for it? It's something where we want to stay neighbors with Chris. But the way our lot is designed, we can't go straight back. Denver has unique property lines that really do get impacted by this, and it's not just clear cut thinking that you can just do an easy remodel and it'll be good to go. I just there's so much that just goes through my mind on this. And honestly, I just. We own the home. It's it's. I feel like someone's taken away something that we've worked hard for. So I urge you to vote no. Thank you, Mr. Bertrand. All right, friend. Friend Thornhill? Yes. My name is Fran Trujillo. I live at 3249 West Fairview Place. I'm about two blocks from the district. I'd like to encourage your positive vote for the Packard's Hill Historic District. I'm not only a resident of the West Highlands. I also live in a has a property with historic designation. I'm here because. Being connected to Denver's rich history. Mattered to me as. A homeowner. I've had some experience with historic designation, and I absolutely know that it does not. Present difficult hurdles for homeowners, but generous and appropriate supports. Owning a property in a district like this is a privilege. It also does not encumber homeowners with difficult red tape or rules which. In any way deny. A property owner their rights. Yes, it will help to preserve the culture and esthetic. Of the neighborhood. But it doesn't keep anyone from appropriately updating and remodeling home. Really good architects and builders are generally well informed. And open to using creativity and skill to. Honor a historic district's needs. This is an important district for many reasons, and it should be protected as a part of Denver's amazing history. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Hill. All right, next five. Alex La Flor, Mary. Margaret Johnson. Thomas. Fletch. Uh. PLO gigolo. Paolo. Alex. Oleg. Boy. One, two, three, four. All right, Alex, you're up first. The floor. Alex La Flor. Okay. Uh, Mary Margaret Johnson. Good evening. My name is Mary Margaret Johnson. I own my home in the proposed district at 3278 Mead Street over there for 27 years now. I thought I'd share with you a little bit about what I learned when I did the history of my house. Like the neighbor who spoke quite a bit earlier when I pulled that building permit, there was a woman's name on it. Her name is Mrs. Stevens, and she lived across the street. She built not only my house, her house, but several houses in the area. In fact, by 1907, she had hung out her shingle as a contractor in the. City directory of Denver. As I researched the historic archives in the newspaper databases I saw as she bought homes. Built homes, sold properties in Packard's hill and the wider Highlands area, and eventually down here in the capital area. So women were building homes, different women were building all kinds of homes in the area. It's an interesting thing. And as the Rocky Mountain News reported, they were a large proportion of homeowners in the whole highlands area and a force to contend with, as many have mentioned earlier. But really in their architectural choices, the women of Packard's hill, if you think about it, they were literally shaping the visual character of this new subdivision, the same character that has attracted so many buyers over the decades. You know, I won't say a whole lot more because you've heard so many great stories about the folks in this area. But I will say that I was talking with my daughter this afternoon. And she said to me about this whole thing. So, yeah, what these women were doing was reflecting what was going on historically in this city at the time. In this state at this time. But more importantly, what it was doing was showing that the experiment was working. I thank you for your consideration this evening and urge you to vote in support of the historic district. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Johnson. Uh. Okay. Thomas felt. Hello. I'm Thomas Felch. I live in the District 3359 Osceola Street at a tall greenhouse about halfway down in this area between 32nd or third and 35th. I see a bunch of people over here that I hope I'm still invited to the October Fast Party next weekend. I, I love this neighborhood. My wife and I moved here into the Highlands in the Ghost District about seven years ago and quickly outgrew when our first child came in, our second one was on the way. So we decided to look in the neighborhood for a property who and a real estate agent here also sold us that property. And, you know, we we love it. We bought it because we felt like we could expand again based on the way that our house is. And I think somebody tonight said earlier, maybe, Nick, we can't go straight back, we can't fit into the guidelines in order to actually have a house that we want to grow our family and and live here for the next 50 years, like many people have done. And that bothers us is it's restrictive. We feel it's restrictive on our rights. And I'm all for honoring doctors and women who build this neighborhood. That's incredible. But let's put up a statue for them. Let's let's do something that doesn't feel like we're taking away half of this room's rights to do what they want with their property. You know. We were pretty fortunate to find the property that we did. We have incredible neighbors and we get a great opportunity to sit out on the front porch or on the back porch in the backyard and have cocktails and talk about this stuff. And I think it's great. I mean, some of my neighbors from the Ghost District are here to speak in our position because of what they went through. And that's real to us. It's money. It's 2 to 3 times as expensive for us to do what we want to do with our house. Then what we want to do with our house. And our house is a prime example of one that was re completely redone about three or four years ago. On the inside and on the outside. It's great, but it's tiny. By today's standards, it's 1800 square feet. And when you have all those toys and you're slipping on them, you're falling down the stairs because there's no place to put your kids. There's no place for guests to come visit. There's no place to have a bathroom that has a shower. So your mom or your dad who are in a wheelchair coming to visit, they can't stay with you. It's it's hurtful. It really kind of it hits us pretty hard and it makes us have to consider. Moving out of the city. And we don't want to do that because we love the neighborhood. We love the people that we like cornhole with and and be every now and then and and have cocktails on the porch with and talk about everything we want to talk about. So thank you. We'd like to on behalf of my wife and my son, my daughter, my dog, Sam, and many of you in this neighborhood know pretty well. We'd like to strongly urge the council to vote no and come to a conclusion and a compromise about something that works for everybody in the room. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Felch. Paula. Paula, I think about. That. I'll say my. Name. Yeah. Yeah, once you do that. Good evening. My name is Paola Jolo and I live in the district with my husband Chris, the Buffalo Bill guy. We live at 30 to 86 Main Street and we were in our house for 17 years. I am strongly in support of the Story District and I agree with everything that everybody of my neighbors have said in favor for it. I'd like to actually use my time to read. A statement for somebody who cannot. Be here tonight. So, dear council members, my name is Jennifer Abel. I'm the owner of Nostalgic Homes Highland's original real estate firm, proudly located in the proposed Packard Hill Historic District at 32nd and Newton Street for more than 30 years. I'm pleased to write in support of the proposed Packer Hill Historic District when only very few people appreciated the true value of the fine historic home in this area nostalgic homestead. Through the years, we were able to introduce new homeowners to this vintage neighborhood and be part of the flourishing, thriving neighborhood. Families choose to stay in the city. Businesses have prospered, and I'm proud that our efforts helped to stabilize and transform a part of the city that desperately needed attention to homes and businesses. Today, it is highly sought after in my 22 years of experience and as a realtor, I know buyers want stability in their neighborhood historic designation support stable, attractive neighborhoods, and some buyers seek out a storied history for their reason. They do not compromise ownership and abilities. In fact, by comparison, housing prices and historic districts in adjacent areas show only slightly higher prices in historic districts. Slightly higher prices in these historic districts often goes hand-in-hand with the fact that historic district often house neighborhood jewels. In reading the Packers SEAL nomination, it was interesting to see the role women professionals and civic activists have had in West Highland and in the city of Denver. Unusual for that period in history. In Denver, many women in Packer held own their own homes, and many women were involved in serving their communities in important roles such as doctors, business owners, teachers and the like. True contributors to the neighborhood. My own grandparents were part of this contribution. Beckett Hill as made a significant contribution to Denver's history. Even as we enjoy a development surge, we all need to do all that we can to preserve our irreplaceable, historic homes and neighborhoods. I encourage you and respectfully put a plea before you to act on September 25th to designate packed or Denver's newest historic district in Denver's popular West Highlands neighborhood, respectively, submitted. Jennifer Able, broker, owner, realtor, nostalgic homes. Thank you so much for your consideration. Please vote yes. Thank you, Mr. YOLO. Alex Olick. Good evening. My name is Alex Olic and together with my wife, we live at 3625 West 30th Avenue since 1994. In the interest of time, I'd like to echo what most people on the opposition have said. I know that we are friends of both sides and I hope to be friends with everybody still after this. But we live in a historic district, and I know that some of my neighbors in the district have had a lot of issues with the district when they were doing work on their homes. So I urge you to vote no. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Mr. Olek. Okay. We have the next five Mary scones. Pam Pollan. Sherrie Moore. Violet Baker. Jerry Mullen. Violet Baker is not here, I hear. William Baker. Okay, Hubby. I hope you stay up late. Okay. Mary Stone zero four SCHOEN. Yes, yes. Good evening. My name is Mary Jones and I live at 3326 Mead Street, which is in the district. While searching for a home to purchase in 2003. I looked at many different Denver areas, but I was repeatedly drawn back to the Highlands neighborhood where I eventually found my dream home. Prior to the recent formal study of the Packard Hill area, I had done my own research to look into my home in the area and learned of the homes that were owned, built and occupied by a variety of women, including women of his historic significance. Now, I'm not claiming that I am a woman of historic significance, but I am happy to carry on this tradition of ownership as an independent, professional woman who has worked in public schools for almost 30 years now in the Denver area. My Queen Anne Cottage was built in 1890, and although it has gone through many transformations over the years, each transformation by each owner preserved the historic Victorian features of the home. I also purchased my home with the intention of nurturing the historic character of both the structure itself and the surrounding gardens, which at this point contains a small pond. When I when the historic district was first proposed, I initially had many questions and concerns, including questions about my home, which is built of sand brick and has a dirt foundation. I think there's a few of those. I also have a crumbling sand brick garage that was probably originally built for a horse or a carriage. So my questions were very important to me. But as I went through the process and went to the meetings and had my questions answered, I was convinced that this was the right move for our neighborhood to preserve not only the history, but the significance of our neighborhood. I'm here tonight to share with you my love of our special neighborhood and to express my support of the establishment of the Packard Hill Historic District. I ask for your support as well by your vote to approve our application. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. Jones. Pam Pullen. It's actually Matt and Pam Bullard should be Matt and they're. Oh, okay. We'll let it go. Go ahead. From the police, we know Law Boulevard. Okay, so it's right across the street from the ghost and across. The street from this proposal for the Packard. Basically, I've lost some friends, some families that were in the ghost place area due to their growing family size and inability to do remodels that are less than. High price. I think I'm the only one here in this building right now that has gone through historic district actual proposals. I presented to the board to get my proposal finished, to get my designs put through. I don't think anybody else is here that is proposed to the council. Anyone? So the only one here that's actually gone through that actual districting and that. Actual proposal process. I've spent an extra $26,000 in architect fees alone. From my first proposal to the board of. Nine. To the actual historic district to the final approval of my plans was one year and one week. Think about that. One year and one week mid construction. For my process to get finished. For approval to finalize my actual permits. The second home I had rent to live in that time. The actual additional cost to construction is exponentially more than that. 26,000. Based on my construction, I was doing interior remodel only the interior. I didn't need historic approval. Unfortunately, during that process, it exposed major structural issues that had to be resolved according to code enforcement. Changed the roofline in the front portion of that building had to be changed. Whether that's supporting the roof structure, which would then reduce the ceiling height, which by code is also not allowed. Caused me to have to change the front. 15 foot of my of my whole. During this process. Staff at Historic suggested I return my two story home back in a one story home. A lot of these things are kind of unacceptable for, I think, most people going through a construction process, planning on living in their home as they do a small remodel. Unfortunately, the actual implications of this district impacts greatly to the people that are living in this district and do want to. Grow their home with their growing family. Please vote no. For my friends sakes, that now live in this proposed district across the street from me, that I've moved from Ghost Place into Packard Hill to allow this kind of construction in their homes to continue. They want to stay in this district. They want to stay in the Highlands, just like I do. And putting this proposal forward will probably push those young families out of these neighborhoods. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Potter. All right, Sherry. Thank you. Sherry Moore. Hi. My name is Sherry More. I live at 3319 mead and I'm in the district and I just would encourage you to vote for Packard Hill. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Moore. Violet Baker. Oh, well, if you're William Baker. I'm William Baker. Can you. I'm sorry. I'm going to get to you a year or two away. I'm sorry. I'm going to get to you in just a second there. This is your your wife. So no. Ileana Fresca is my wife. Violet Baker is my daughter. Okay. But your thought you called me up to take her place. No, no, no. I'm going to give. If Violet Baker's not here, you're into people. I'm going to get to you. Sorry about that. Got a whole family out here testifying. Okay, Violet Baker's not here. You can take her off. Jerry. Marlene. Great. And then, William, you're up next. My name is Jerry Marlene. I'm a property owner in the Ghost Historic District. We were 30th and Irving Street. I very much support this historic district. I love our history. I'd like to talk about the Denver mares that are associated with Packers Hill. Well, no. Mayor actually lived in Packard Hill while they served as mayor. There were three who either lived in the district before they served as mayor or own property in the area in addition to the three mayor mayors. There's also Alderman John Ah Thurston of the Town of Highlands, who lived in the district not only while he served, but also during his mayoral campaign. The fact. In fact, his opponent in that race lived right next door. I'm sure that was interesting. Robert Mayor Robert Speer owned property in the Packard Hill, but he never lived there. There was Mayor William Mills, who took over from Mayor Speer when he died, had lived next door to the alderman of the town of Highlands and was in fact his opponent in that race. Mayor Mills, who lived at 3825 West 32nd Avenue, went on to become manager of improvements and perks in Denver. Mayor Mills is credited with civic improvements in Denver, including the completion of the Civic Center. Benjamin Stapleton. Lived in several homes in Packard's Packard Hill between 1911 and 1920 before he became mayor. He held the office of Denver Police Magistrate from 1904 to 1915. He was then appointed by Woodrow Wilson. Two Denver postmaster in 1915, at the same time that Wilson appointed several other KKK members to other federal government positions in his move to segregate the federal government. We do not celebrate Stapleton's appalling connection to the KKK. But we must take note of this part of our history, or we may be doomed to repeat it. We instead celebrate the many other people, notable men and women who lived in Packard's hill and contributed so greatly to the development of Denver. I urge you to please help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Miller. All right, Jim Baker. Good evening, 22 figured out. I'm William Baker. I'm from Park Hill and I'm speaking in opposition to the historic designation. I think I bring three things here I am three things that other people in this audience are not. So I can bring some different perspectives. First off, I'm a builder. I've spent my entire career of over 35 years restoring, repairing and improving and in character, old homes, exclusively old homes. I don't do anything new in the 1930. I started in the East Coast doing houses that were a pretty American revolution. And now I'm here. I do this because I love old homes. And yet I speak against this designation. I will come back to this. I'm also the owner of a 1908 house in Park Hill. I popped the top. We had a historic designation brouhaha there, and all the people who were in favor of the designation agreed that this was a truly excellent project and they thought it very attractive and they all agreed that under a historic designation it would not have been allowed. So I'm very grateful that I was able to do it before the designation was considered. As a resident of Park Hill, we went through the same process recently. It's actually still ongoing in a certain way. I heard I had the benefit of a year's time to study all about historic designation and read statistics from around the country and various articles that added to my knowledge as a builder. I heard the same misinformation that we have heard tonight. Both sides provide a certain amount of misinformation, but. I heard about the minimum cost of this of doing this project, the ease of the process, the improved property values. And I'm afraid numbers do lie. I can tell you later if I have the time. The truth of the matter is, it's very hit and miss. It depends on what neighborhood you live in, what the demographics are, what the socioeconomic levels are, how impoverished the neighborhood is, what state you're in. Many, many things. Historic designation does help certain neighborhoods, typically ones that are decrepit and impoverished and low value, which Packard Hill is not. That is why Historic Designation was originally set up. Whether your house is specific, how impacted it is by this designation depends on so many factors, what style it is, whether your roof line is perpendicular or parallel to the street, how big your lot is. Do you have the possibility of an addition? How high is your ridge line? Are you on a corner lot, etc.? So some people will have a fairly easy time and some people will be turned down outright for the project they want to do. When this problem. Comes to Mr. Baker. Your time is up. Yeah. I was halfway through it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, next five. Bob McCormick. Ron Johnson. Pat Devore, the FE. Uh, Chris. Uh. The. And Roger Oram. You can help me out, Chris, when you get up here. Bob McCormack, you are first. Thank you. My name's. Bob McCormick and. Other 3319 Meade Street, which is in the proposed zone. Just a couple of things. Most people have mentioned everything that I probably would have to say. Let's go back to that comment about looking into the future that and I have a quick story on that. When I, too, was an elected official at one point and said on that side of this and participated in a in a very controversial, historic district, and I was sort of opposed to it. I wasn't actually living in it. I was one block away. And I can just tell you that 40 years later, I went back into my old neighborhood and we were one block off of the historic district. My lack of support was a mistake. The street that I grew up, my children on, it's a. Architecturally disagreeable, I would say. And I know that personal experience is a little limited to go by, but that's my personal experience. Regarding the divisiveness somebody talked about, we were caretakers for our homes that she feels privileged to be a caretaker for. Whereas I like to say that we're you know, even though we're coming at this from different angles, collectively, we're caretakers of the community. We those of us who are in favor of the Packard Hill designation, are doing what we think is proper for being a caretaker for a community. And I'm sure this side does, too. And I'm here, I support it. And I and I also support, you know, my neighbors. We have a wonderful community in regarding the divisiveness. And many of, you know, me and I spend an awful lot of time sitting in a front porch. Next Sunday. We're having an Octoberfest in whatever side of this. Issue you sit on. You're more than. Welcome to join us. You know, I think the divisiveness is we do have different approaches, but I think. Our hearts are in the same place. We care about our community. And however you turn this out this evening, I think the community will pull back together again. I don't think it's a terminal illness that we suffer for going through this process. But I appreciate your time. I know it's late. I'm done. Thank you. Next up, Ron Johnson. My name is Ron Johnson. I've lived in the neighborhood for 30 years. Uh, I think this poor neighborhood is being loved to death by both sides. It appealed to me when I first came in the neighborhood because of its diversity in architecture and the background of the people that live there. It offered people that moved into the neighborhood a chance to improve their lives. It was a neighborhood in transition from older people to younger people with beginning their families. And because of that, people could move in there with their dreams to build a house that they wanted to raise their family. And if it involved adding a room, popping the top or keeping it as it was, it gave them a chance to live their dream. This proposition takes that dream out of their hands. And I don't want to see that happen. I think we're here tonight to persuade you, not persuade each other, that whatever you vote is going to have an effect on one side or the other. If you vote for the historic designation, it's going to hurt some people that came in here with some dreams. It's going to hurt your opportunities to turn those properties over when they get ready to retire or move or whatever is done. If you vote to oppose it, these people that are supporting it will be disappointed. But I don't think they'll be hurt as far as property values. In 30 years, I've seen property values in this area just skyrocket. I think many of us here probably could not afford to buy our own homes right now. So I don't think adding property value as an issue for historic designation is a good incentive. I think the thing to do is to keep the neighborhood vibrant, diverse, alive. It's not stagnant, it's not dead. It doesn't need to be hung on a wall and preserved. So please vote no on this. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Pat Duffy. Very good. My name is Pat Duffy and good evening, council members. I reside at 2979 Raleigh Street, about five blocks away from the proposed Packard Hill historic district. I've lived in this home in West Highlands for nearly 30 years, and before that, seven years north of the old Ilitch Gardens. It used to be in our neighborhood, in the Berkeley neighborhood. My husband and I have been very active members of the West Highland Neighborhood Association for over 27 years, and we've also been active in surveying four just discovered Denver for the last couple of years. I hope you remember in my brown book, Rediscovering Northwest Denver by Ruth Weaver. That I've used in testimony several times before. I want to share an excerpt from this book about why we love our northwest Denver neighborhood in Highlands. Homebuilding have been spotty, with some estates occupying a whole block, other blocks fully built up and nearby ones vacant as they filled this section of town, became a good example of the types of middle class architecture in Denver during the 1880s and nineties. Some developers had built rows of five or six Victorian one story or sometimes two story homes. Houses in a block and left the rest vacant. Those these first were built on the narrow 25 foot lots allotted at that time. Later, there were rows of Denver squares of one story neo classic of the so-called Anglo Bengal bungalows with wide front porches which were built in the 1920s. Just before World War Two. The preferred style was English, Tudor, large or small. After the war, building was rapid and city lot size ranch houses were built. I haven't seen many of those, but then suddenly there were very few lots left on which to build in this part of northwest Denver became static in just the last few years. So this would have been. She wrote this book in the seventies, mid seventies. In just the last few years, Highlands has been rediscovered as the last bit of early Denver, with a great many and deteriorated homes. Young couples are buying houses to restore them to their Victorian glory, to go along with those that have been kept in good condition by loving families. That early pride of Highlanders has never died. The people are still proud of their homes, their gardens, their trees, their churches, their schools. They are proud of their pure cold water, which they swear is colder than that in any other part of Denver. They are proud of their pure air. Perhaps not so unsullied as as at one time, but above most of the city's smog, so that they still have their treasured view of the towering blue and white sentinels of the Rockies and with a man in the of the 1890s. They can look down from their happy homes on the Eminence, where Highlands proudly sits upon the smoky city below. Once again, these yellowed tabs in this book are historic homes that were written up in this book that we have lost. And so we're hoping that Packard Hill is approved and that we don't have more yellow tabs that I have to mark in my book. Please approve this historic district. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Fame. Chris. The. Hello. My name is Chris Vassiliadis. My wife and I live at 3439 Isola in the proposed district and we are here. I am here in favor. She can't be with our seven month old, but in favor of the proposed district. Two things. Maybe add a little bit of color of things that haven't been said. I think of historic, historic designation as being something bigger than us and outside of our own self-interests. And that's why I support this area. I can talk about all the reasons why I love living here, but I don't trust that if a property we see properties turn over in our neighborhood pretty frequently. And I don't trust that with 1 to 3 turnovers of a property that 100 years of history can't be wiped out by one decision. So I think everybody here loves our neighborhood and wants to see it remain somewhat the same, the things that we love about it, I think some of us just want to ensure that. And then secondly, the thing I love, one of the things I love about the neighborhood is riding my bike into downtown, to my job, and I get to ride through some beautiful neighborhoods and architecture. Potter Highlands is a historic district that I ride through every day, and in the last two years that I've lived here, I've seen a number of a number of approved modifications to the architecture that give me a sense of freedom that if we do want to modify our home, that that it is reasonable process to go through, but maintaining the character of the neighborhood that we love. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Roger. Are. Q Thank you. Thank you all. I am Roger or I'm a native North Denver, eight and nearly 39. Your property owner and resident at 3230 Newton Street in the proposed district where my wife Stephanie also lives, we could have moved elsewhere, but chose to remain in this historic and beautiful neighborhood. I very much support the proposed Packard's Hill historic district. I had other remarks that aren't of much consequence at this moment because they've already been mentioned several times. But there's a couple of things I guess I would like to say. Is that our area is on the front line of development. And there is no doubt about that. And things aren't going to change unless we get this historic designation. And I can tell you. And the difference is going to be very evident as time goes. By between. Our neighborhood and the neighborhood south of us on 32nd. Avenue. And I would just also like to mention that many of the housing that's coming up in our. Neighborhood is very similar to the type that was has been. Constructed or in. Cherry Creek. Where, you know, the houses in that neighborhood used to be of 1950s and 1960s vintage, but are now pretty much all gone. But that could very well can happen in our neighborhood as well. So I strongly. Ask that you vote. Yes. And I thank you very much. All right. Thank you, Mr. Arm. All right, next five. Rosemary Stovall. Camille. Paul. Mary Joseph Halpern. Thomas Simmons and Lisa Leslie Fogel. We're on the homestretch, everyone. Just a check in under 20, under 20. All right, Rosemary Stovall. All right. Under 18. Cook. Camille. Paul. Mary. Hello. Members of council. My name is Camille Palmieri. My husband, John, and I live at 36 Osceola Street in the Wolfe Place Historic District and in the landmarked, Herman Hugo Heizer House, the Wolfe Place Historic District was approved almost 11 years ago. This hasn't stopped people from renovating their houses. Three houses on our block have been renovated and sold in the last two years. We are currently renovating our house and we have been approved for tax credits. We have a new roof. We tore off it back edition. We replaced it with a new addition, a new porch. We're doing a lot of interior things that that, of course, don't need approval. Historic districts help maintain the balance among residential, commercial and multifamily buildings. The West Highlands has a number of commercial areas, including great restaurants and other amenities. The neighborhood also has a number of large apartment buildings and duplexes. The Packard Hill Historic District District will help protect the residential aspect of the neighborhood. The proposed Packard Hill District has some beautiful historic houses with turrets, decorative trim bay windows, stained glass, Denver, red brick and other Victorian details. These buildings house several significant figures. We have lived in Denver for over 35 years. The economic boom we are experiencing will not last forever. But if we don't protect this city's history, it will be lost forever. And yeah, I'm speaking and I don't live in the district, but why I'm here is just to say that. We we applied for, but we. Are. Sorry the guidelines that we had were approved and it wasn't a big burden and everything seemed pretty seamless. So thank you. Thank you. Paul Mary Joseph helping. Good evening. My name is Joseph Halpern. I live at 519 Ogden Street in the Alamo Placidia historic district. I'm here even though I live outside the district because we have 17 years of experience with a middle class, historic district. We were the first middle class historic district ever created by the Denver City Council because like Packard Hill, we had a few grand Victorians built before the silver crash of 1893. And after that, it became a working class and middle class neighborhood of bungalows and a lot of even one story duplexes. When we came before you on June 12th, 2000, or before your. Predecessors, other than Councilman Ortega, who was actually here at the time. We had it's very deja vu because we had a very similar situation. We had a deeply divided neighborhood. There were lots of. People who. Were opposed to it. There were lots in favor. There were lots of passions on both sides. And at the end of a. Very long hearing that went past midnight. The council unanimously. Approved it, but not without some misgivings. And I'll never forget what Councilwoman Ramona martinez said. She looked directly at the landmark commission staff members who were there and said, Take back to your commission the following. You cannot. Treat a. District like this the same way you treat. Denver Country Club and Humboldt Island Historic. District with their big fancy mansions. You've got to recognize different contexts. And the Landmark Commission took that to heart. And the reason that that document that one gentleman showed you is so thick is because it covers the gamut and it covers. Big, fancy mansions. It covers modest. Houses. And it does it in a way that only a small. Portion of those guidelines are going to apply to any particular project in a given neighborhood. And it is a manageable process. I have seen an Alamo. Policy to, over. The last 17 years, numerous second story additions. The term pop top is disfavored. But that's what they are. I've seen numerous site additions, huge rear additions that have virtually doubled the size of houses and in in even on on. Infill lots and where there were scrapes of non historic houses, we've gotten some very modern architecture. Not my thing, but the landmark commission will approve. What looks to be like a malibu. Beach house in Alamo placebo. And that's fine because we need some. Professionals like we have on the Landmark Commission to make those decisions. And and so I just I'm here. To say to everyone. Including those who believe this can't work, it really can work. And it's worked in Alamo. Policy, too. And however this comes out, I hope that. Everyone will repair relations as we did in our. Procedure. We get along great and have block parties. And a lot of us were there 17 years ago. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Halper. Thomas Simmons. Council members. My name is Tom Simmons. I've lived in Berkeley neighborhood for 30 years and I'm a coauthor of this application. Since the early 1990, our firm has studied many of Denver's older neighborhoods for community planning and development. Historic Denver and neighborhood groups. These projects prepared neighborhood histories and identified historically scenic significant areas and individual properties if present. Our firm also prepared Denver Landmark District applications for downtown Denver, Pennsylvania Street Wolf Place in the early Lanham Ghost District. In studying the Packard Hill area, we employed the same techniques for researching and analyzing its eligibility as potential Denver Landmark District as we did for all these earlier local landmark districts, including identifying its historical significance, describing the nature of its architecture, evaluating the contributing known contributing status of the properties, and determining the appropriate boundary of the potential district. The historical significance, I think, was addressed rather well by Karen of CPD. The story of the expansion of the street street railways and the surge in subdivision planning and residential development is a very important one in Highlands and Denver's history. It emerged as a very significant middle class residential area from the late 1890 to the early 20th century. And it continues to be treasured by its residents. Today, as Laurie Simmons started to address and several older people have alluded to, the district is notable for its the activity of its women. By approving this historic district and recognizing its strong association with women's history will demonstrate your belief in the importance of women in Denver's history. The story of this often neglected and ensure young girls of future generations that there is a tangible link to those earlier women such as Dr. Mary Ford who paved the way. A number of people have mentioned that the district has about 82% contributing. And the way we assess that is we look to see if properties were built within the period of significance between 1886 and 1940, and about nearly 90% of the buildings were built within that period. We also look to see how altered the buildings are, and essentially a contributing percentage like that indicates that there's relatively few alterations and they maintain their character. I would also an earlier opponent produced a map. I would suggest that you look in your package at the map produced by CPD staff that shows favorable people in green, unfavorable in red, and that map is a sea of green for this district. I urge you to support the designation of the district, and I'm available for any questions, if you have any. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Simmons. Leslie Fogel. My name is Leslie Fogle. I live on Perry Street outside the district, but I do. Work on 30 West Street within the district. So I'm familiar with the area and I'm here just in support of the Packard Hills District designation of the Package Hills District. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Next five. John Olsen. John Harrell. Ginny Parrott. William Chesser. Jamie Chesser. And that's five. They're the chasers. Okay. Go ahead, journalist. Well, hello, my name is John Olsen. I am the director of preservation programs for Historic Denver in my office at 1420 Ogden Street in Denver. I want to thank the City Council for hearing the neighbors tonight and for this opportunity for them to use the tools given by the city to proactively improve our neighborhoods. But those tools, without action, do nothing to implement what those tools are intended for the neighbors before you tonight who have applied for this proposed historic district, have trusted that by using the tools of the historic ordinance, by methodically communicating their wants and needs with their neighborhood, that you will reward them by doing what they ask, by taking action to protect their homes and their neighborhood. Before you as the most thorough, historic district nomination in the history of the city. Packard Hill is right in the middle of an area under rapid change and pressure. The neighbors who have applied wanted to be proactive and manage that change rather than come before council. Every moment that change went awry. It was mentioned right here at council. That for them to be proactive and to band together to plan for the future. These neighbors have done just that. I urge you to vote for this application and make Packard's Hill a historic district. Don't deter a neighborhood's voice. A voice which did everything right to get here and which deserves your vote. Thank you for your consideration. Oh, right. Thank you. Mr. Olsen, you had 6 minutes and, uh, right on point. John Harrell. Mr. Harrell. Good evening, honorable members of the Denver Chamber of Commerce. My name is John Prescott. Call me. The last name is Harrell. My beautiful wife and I reside in the Cox Gargoyle house on Lowell Boulevard. That's the one that has a dragon out in front. Who are the years? I've lived in a number of places around the world. I was a military person for a long time and I've seen how some communities rise to the top. Others don't rise to the top. However, one of the most important things I've learned is continuity. Continuity and a community continuity and plans continuity and the way things are done. I believe in continuity and I believe in wonderful, good construction. Grandfather Harrell was a guy who did that fancy work like this stuff here. He carved it by hand and he taught me that if you ever do anything, stand behind what you do and make sure that you give it the very best of your talent and your physical skills. Because tomorrow all that will be left of you is nothing but what you have done will last for the lifetime of people. So therefore, when my beautiful wife and I moved to. Denver area. We met. And then we decided we wanted something that matched what my grandparents on both sides taught me. And her parents did the same thing. That's how we wound up in the area we live and the Cox car. All girl horse mix maximizes my belief that things should be strong if made out of stone. I was told to build on a hill so that people could see it. That's why we're there and our community. Just ooze with those qualities. I'd like to see it continue. I'd like to see it being voted upon as yes, because it's a good place for children to grow up and us old people can live the rest of our days. Please say yes to our area. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Good night. Thank you, Mr. Harrow. Okay. Come on. Come on, come on. Try not to clap. Okay. Ginny? Ginny, is that her? Ginny p. My sister. And she did have to go home. She had to go. Okay. Down one. All right, we have the Chester's. What? William Chester. I'm wheelchair, sir. My wife Jamie and I live in a non contributing home at 32 Tennessee Street with our two children and we've lived there for the last 11 years. A mere 20 years ago, the family before us bought the home for themselves. And despite the hipsters in the carriage house and a lack of glass on the windows open to the elements, but for shutters, they chose not to tear down, but to make it a home for their own family. And we're so glad that they did. I had a lot of things to say and topics to touch on. Everybody's covered that well. You guys have heard a lot of. Information back and. Forth. Property prices are going to go up. Property prices are going to go down. You guys know the exacting standards that our application process has gone through. All of the people here that are supporting it. Speak to the importance of this district and its meaningfulness to our city, and I urge you to support the district. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Chesser. Jamie Chesser. Good evening, everyone, and thank you. City. Council members. My family appreciates. Your service to this great city. And I'm here tonight to share my. Emphatic support for. The Packard's Hill Historic District in northwest Denver. I am Jamie Chesser as my husband. Well, our son, Hank, five and a. Half, is at home with the sitter, as is Vera, who's three and. A half. And as well said, we live at 3210 Osceola Street. We have a big peace sign. On our house. That's how I tell people where we live. And we've lived in the home since of. All days, Halloween 2006. And we love this community and we're so happy to call Denver home. We feel we have an extremely unique and special neighborhood in West Highlands. Our little piece of the pie in Denver. And I really appreciate and I've seen this over the last several years more, more so that Denver really recognizes the value in protecting these special places. And the fact that we have a landmark ordinance for over 50 years tells me that the city of Denver and the people of Denver see value in protecting our common history. Earlier, you heard Marilyn Quinn say the quote from Michael Hancock about when we lose homes and houses and restaurants, we lose our soul. I totally agree with that quote. I thought it. Was pretty powerful. I also sat in these very chambers a couple of. Years ago and heard Council President Brooks. Asking. Us to bring council historic districts rather than trying to preserve homes piecemeal. And we took that to heart, and that's why we're here. So thankfully, the. Vast majority of property owners in this area recognize. The history of the area and the historic character, the architectural. Integrity of the neighborhood. And would like to see it preserved for all of Denver and generations to come. I would urge you to please side with the vast majority of the neighbors who value the character that brought so many of us to make our homes here in this place. Please help us make sure that some places in Denver that are truly unique are preserved for all the people of Denver to enjoy. And I just urge you again. To please help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration of our application. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Chesser. All right, let's. Five Allison Williams Helm. Poor C cloud. John Paul. Mary, this is graduation. Terry Gulliver. Anita Lynch. Allison Williams how your first. Hi there. My name is Alison Williams home. I live at 3244 Main Street in the district that's being proposed here. I am in support of that district. My house is a queen, an 1893. So it's actually older than this period of significance. It's an obnoxious greenhouse, and a lot of people know it just because of that. I'm a fourth generation native of Colorado. I've only lived in Highland for two years. But I want to tell you a quick story about our house. When me and my husband were in the process of buying the house, the family who was selling it to us had lived there, different iterations of the family for 60 years. And they called our realtor no more than three times to ask, Are they serious? Are they going to leave the house standing? Are they going to tear this house down? Are they a family? Do they have kids? And so I would just like to say that to my neighbors. I think that we can get beyond this. And we are very close and we are divided. But I think Don would have been in support of this effort. So thank you. All right. Thank you, Michelle. Paul C clout. My name is Paul Cloyd. My wife and I have lived in our classic cottage at 30, 33 Yates and West Highlands for more than 30 years. I am a registered architect and a licensed professional engineer. I believe the application clearly shows that the Packard Hill District exhibits. Significant integrity to warrant designation as a Denver landmark. Parkhill is part of the heart of Denver. The district is bookended by exceptionally significant architectural designs. We've already heard of the 1886 Wilbur Bill's Ford house, the Dr. Mary Ford House by the distinguished architect William Quail. This sits at the southwestern corner of the district. And then at the northeastern district, we have the Cox Gargoyle house that you've heard about. In between these bookends, Park Hill is a, as you've heard, a mix of styles over the decades. These styles have. Ranged from Queen Anne up to the English Norman Cottages. This mix of styles is essential to the the magnetism and the attraction and the importance of this neighborhood. While the homes are of several different styles, there is an undeniable harmony in this multitude of historic homes. The district presents a continuity through its setbacks, the forms, proportions and exterior building materials. The historic district designation and the city's design guidelines are the very best tools for ensuring that these historic homes. Are not. Lost. The West Highlands Neighborhood Association Design and Preservation Committee, which I serve on, feels that the design guidelines can be of help to all owners in West Highlands of Historic Homes. While the committee often assists owners within the existing districts of Wolf and Coast, we are now offering that assistance to any owner of a historic house in West Highlands at their discretion. I can assure you that we see a number of projects coming through in Wolf and Ghost into pop tops, etc. These are not static districts, but we are getting some good projects coming through and in fact we have a popped up bungalow that we felt so good about. We forward it to the Mayor's Design Award Committee. It didn't succeed, but it was a really nice job. I'm grateful to have had a small part in uncovering a part of the story of Packard's Hill and sharing that story with the people of Denver. Please protect this part of the heart of Denver. Thank you. Thank you, sir. John Paul Murray. Good evening. My name is John Palmieri. I live on Osceola between 30th and 32nd in the Wolfe Place Historic District. I'm here today to share our experience that with all due respect, it is an added burden, and I understand that. But the burdens that have been in place have not been unreasonable or undue. We've been through the process. It's worked for us. It's worked for a number of houses on our block. There have been three that have been renovated, and I respect the concerns that are expressed. But it has to be a balance and that there are added burdens, but there are existing burdens, and that this isn't a situation where you have unlimited access or unlimited ability to do whatever you want with your house, their existing provisions in place, they have to be addressed. The added burdens have not been reasonable. Versus that the economic boom we're in now. Will not last forever if we don't protect the history of our city. It will be lost forever. Ask that you support the district. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Terry Gulliver. Thank you. I just checked my clock to see if I should say good. Morning. And thank you. My name is Terry Gulliver. I live at 227 South Lincoln, which is in the middle of the relatively new Lincoln historic district. Congress Councilman Clark's district, where Quinn and district are small one. I'd like to just speak briefly to some of the concerns that have been raised. From my experience with that. When our application was being processed, we became aware that one of the houses in the middle of the block, in fact the oldest one of William Lang's early and perhaps slightly klutzy experiments, was going to come on the marketplace, and we knew it would be scraped, and then that would be the end of our district because we would lose our critical mass. So a bunch of neighbors got together and formed an LLC to restore this place. And when they got our application approved, living just two doors down the street. I've been supervising a lot of the early construction phase of that house, and since it got complicated, we've had general contractor run it. But I supervise a lot of the early stuff personally and got to see just what the prices were. And I can say that it really did not add a lot of incremental burden to go through the permitting. And when we had questions, the historical stuff was very helpful on the phone and sometimes we went in with drawings and things to talk through them and they were much more help than hindrance. And somebody talked about the old red brick houses being crumbly and deserving to be bulldozed. And at one stage I thought that about this place as well. We I think we can now have a buffalo tango inside that house. It wasn't really that onerous, a matter of cementing the two layers of brick and the foundations. One of the concern that I heard somebody voiced, and I'm surprised that I only heard it once, was insurance rates going up. That was brought up on our application as well. And that's, shall I say, bogus. It just doesn't happen. If it does, your insurance company needs to be changed. So I would definitely second the sentiments of the gentleman who spoke before me and I'll get out of your way. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Miss Gulliver. Anita Lynch. Good evening and thank you all for letting us speak and for staying awake. I live with this guy at 227 South Lincoln Street. We are in that home. Our home was historically designated and unanimously approved by the city council. So thank you. We did our home first and then our block of 200 South Lincoln. And it it has been a wonderful experience. We know that it does increase the value we've already seen as we've had three or two people since it was approved that relocated to different cities. Their homes went under contract immediately. I talked to one of the people who was buying one of the homes and I said they moved here from California. And I said, What made you pick this home? Why did you want this house? And they said, We lived in a historic district in California. And when we came here, we told our realtor, we only want to see homes in a historic district. So it is not onerous in that manner. I think a lot of times we operate from fear and I think fear can override sometimes. I've seen this for myself, my own good judgment. I understand the fear of people here that you're not going to be able to do what you want to do to your home. We have standards anyhow within our city. We you know, if you want to be able to do whatever you want to do to a home, I guess you go live in the boonies somewhere. I don't know. But it is not it is not onerous. We've seen this. And I want to read just quickly from one of our neighbors who could not be here tonight. They live at 2 to 4 South Lincoln Street. There in our district is Carolyn Alden and Eric Bennett. And this is what they said. As owners in this historic block, we take great solace in the fact that none of the neighboring homes will be allowed to be torn down by a developer, by developers to construct what appears to be temporary solutions to the growing population, many being eyesores on the landscape. Historic designation is a must to maintain the integrity and value of these neighborhoods, no matter when they were built. We have gone through landmark preservation approval for modification to the exterior, and by providing a complete accurate submission, we received landmark approval very quickly. We believe when buying a historic home, you have a responsibility that comes with it to maintain that authenticity for future generations. We offer support to Packard Hill's neighborhood, and I also offers strong support and I hope council will vote in favor of this and preserve this neighborhood. Thank you all. Thank you, Ms.. Lynch. All right. The last two. Gertrude Grant, Stockton Baker. Bring us home. Well, Mr. Grant, you're up first. And I'm still standing. I can't believe it. My name is Gertrude O'Grady Grant. I live at 242 South Lincoln Street, Denver. And no, I do not live in the Packard Hill historic district. But I urge you to support this district. As Nita and Terri have just testified, a couple of us got together and bought a house in the historic district in which my house is located. And also this house that we bought across the street that we were afraid was going to be torn down and threaten the integrity of the row of houses that would soon be included in our historic district. We're making new numerous improvements, several of which required approval by the Landmark Commission. And if you get a decent. Architect who knows the. Price, it's grim. This grant was great. Mr.. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Just if you wait. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Know, just. Just just talk to us. We thank you, architect. Who knows the system, knows the rules. Things go through landmark like that. It does not take a long time. Any delays that we have were not caused by the landmark designation was caused by the scarcity of construction workers in Denver's boom time. In any decision like this, it's impossible to find 100% support. And it's true there are going to be people who, for whatever reason. I think most of it is fed by fear and false information, are not going to support historic designation. Some claim that creating the historic district is the taking of property rights. I disagree. Yes, it impacts what you can do with your property, but it gives you guidelines that you can follow in order to preserve the character and integrity of your neighborhood. In fact, even though the statistics show that property values have increased ie in historic districts, that to me is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that it gives a security that is gained by knowing that the houses on your block can't be changed in ways that destroy the character of the neighborhood and make it totally incongruous. Denver strives to be sustainable, yet construction debris is approximately a quarter of the landfill waste. Old growth, oak and brick from demolished houses go to the landfill. Our old brick houses can be renovated and and remodeled for larger families. We cannot replace the craftmanship not only inside, but the brick detail outside, over the doors and windows, on the chimneys and along the facades and sides of these older houses. What will we show the next generation as great grandchildren that we value? Ms.. Grant. Your time is up. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Wow. Stockton Baker. Number nine. Number nine. Bring us. Home. My name is Stockton Baker. I live at 435 Humboldt Street. My wife and I live in the Valley Park Place Circle District. Bottom line is the best decision ever made. If you want to preserve the character of your neighborhood, you vote for this. If you don't care about the character neighborhood, you can't control your neighborhood. You vote against it. I urge your support to vote. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Baker. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, the comment portion of this public hearing is now complete. Thank you all for being here. Thank you for being very patient. We will now go into questions by members of council. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. I know a lot of folks have left and I hope some of them are still here. I had some questions for Christina and Alex Holderness. Are they still here? Hi. Hi. 3221. Osceola, do you live there? We do not. Not currently. You're on Marion Street? Yes. Eighth, eighth and Marion basically. Between eighth and ninth. Yes, sir. Okay. And you bought this house in 2009 for about $255,000. You're looking at public record, obviously. Yes. Okay. What's your intention to. As I stated in my comments, the intention was to knock that house down and build a house for ourselves that we could make our own home and grow old. And so then you would move from Marion to Marion Street? Absolutely. Our intention to move from Marion when we had the funds to knock that house down and build a modern house. Okay. All right. Thank you. Is Mark Macaluso here? Hi. You build a duplex and while you're walking up to the microphone and I took a look at that online and it completely out of character with the neighborhood. What why did you decide on that particular? It looks kind of like a cube sitting in the middle of these bungalows. Why did you decide to build a house of that style in this particular neighborhood? Well, as I said earlier, or life in general, what makes our country great is diversity. And, you know, I wanted a house to appeal to more than just one set of people. And the people that I have in the other side of the house are very fine, upstanding people. So. I mean, I just I like diversity. I moved into the neighborhood not because of. The houses, but because of where. That's where the proximity it's located. And and quite frankly, I think you can ask most people here, and they're going to say that the charm of the Packard Hill district is the feel, the quiet, the peacefulness, the neighborhood, the it's it's quaint. It's not necessarily the houses. I mean, it's located right next to Denver. So you have urban living. And that's that's an appeal to most people. I wanted to live in the city and I didn't want to live downtown. Right. You know, in the heart of the city. So you get the urban feel, plus the neighborhood feel at the same time. So I wanted to maximize the square footage of the house because I wanted families to be able to move in their multi. You know, I wanted people more than just a husband and wife. I wanted family, kids. I mean, that's why this neighborhood is is appealing. And you ask and you look at the just look at the demographics on both sides. You see young and you see old. Right. So if you if you want a home. Okay. Sorry, I just I back you younger, more experienced. Yes. As someone who just signed up for Social Security, I resemble that remark. Thank you. Either way. Either way. I'm glad you let me ask. One of the ability for for families to grow. Thank you. And that's the vibrant appeal in the neighborhood. All right. Thank you. Kara, can I ask you a couple of questions? And based on some of these in the presentation I saw there was a house as actually somebody testified here. And you mentioned there's a house in the Wyman District that has a glass cube in the rear. Yes. And how was that allowed? That's an exterior modification. Is it just because you couldn't see it from the street? Yes. So it wasn't highly visible from the street. And so you can use modern you can use modern. Materials or. Other materials. But yet and. That's an historic district in the Wyman District. And and I looked at it while you were testifying, and it looks kind of bizarre. Can you put solar panels on a house that's in a historic district? Yes, there are design guidelines for it, but yes, they can be put in a historic district. Okay. And there was one individual, Matthew Brown, who said he would not be able to pop his top. Okay. That would be financially irresponsible. What are what are the guidelines for expanding and popping a top on a on a historic house in a historic district? That's a craftsman one story. What what obstacles are in the way of that that are not present in a non historic district. So the design guidelines call for tafsir and you know sort of additions to be set 15 back from 15 feet back from the front facade, which would probably be what they're talking about is probably the largest. Difference between that and not in the historic district. Okay. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President, for now. All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Good questions, Councilman Castro. Don't. Don't sit down. It was so close. Yeah. You might as well just sit up there. Just some basic numbers. How many units, how many residences are in the proposed district? So there are 173 properties. When we send out our letters for the assessors, we sent out two one in June and one in August, and we pulled the current assessor records for each of those, and we sent out 185 letters one time and a 184. So that's how many letters we sent out to property owners. That could be two people on a particular who owned one building, but we sent out 100 and about 185 letters. We don't have a precise number as to the. Number of homes in the district. So there's 173 buildings there. You know, we don't have the precise number of addresses. Okay. 173 buildings. And how many are non-conforming? I want to say like 41, but I'd have to double check the numbers. It's 82% are contributing and 18% are not. Okay. And I assume you don't have detailed numbers like how many bungalow, how many queen in classic cottages, etc.. Those that those are within the it is within the application. I would have to pull it up, but they are in the application. Bless you. Thank you very much. And then one other thing to follow up on what Councilman Flynn had to say. The solar panel thing, you said there are some design guidelines. So, yes, the guidelines address solar panels and they call for the solar panels to be on the rear two thirds of the building or anywhere on an accessory structure. Okay. That's all I have for right now. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Castro and Councilwoman Black. Thank you. I'm not sure who I'm asking this question of, but maybe we'll start with you, Kara. So I'm still not clear on who is in favor of it and who is opposed. I was the person who requested the green and red map, but I know that it's not entirely complete. And this group provided a map that and they said they have 75 that are opposed, which this map has something like 21 opposed. So that that is a vast difference. And personally, I can't make a decision with that big of a discrepancy. So. So so the. Map that we. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. The map that we created incorporated all of the comments that CPD had received. And it came from a variety of sources. It came from public comments, both in support and opposition, a petitions that the applicant submitted. It came from letters that had been forwarded from City Councilmember Sussman. Councilwoman Sussman said forwarded a lot to us. And so it was an aggregate of all of the the public comments that CPD had received prior to submitting our staff report for our deadline. And so what is on that map reflects what we had received at that point. There was a petition that we received after, you know, on Friday that was not incorporated into our staff. Report. From the people in opposition. And did you evaluate that or it was just too late? I mean, I didn't do as thorough evaluation as I had with the petition from the supporters because it had come with enough time. So I had gone through looked at all of those and about for about 75% of those petitions, I had pulled up the assessor records to make sure we were matching on those. I didn't do that for the petition in opposition because I just simply didn't have the time to go through and do the assessor today. What they. And. Okay, thank you. And so whoever put this together, can you come? Okay. Notification. If you'd like it, we can provide you with the petition, with all the signatures and the addresses. My wife who submitted that map, if you'd like to see it again, I'm happy to show it to you. I spent three weekends walking the entire district, knocking house by house and delivering fliers and asking people if they were in support, if they were willing to, or if they were willing to support the Keep West Highlands Free Petition. We met myself. I walked at least 60% of the district and gathered most of those signatures on Oakland. Is that what this is? That's what this is. That would be the signatures distilled into an Excel. Yes, that's what this represents. So I actually know by knocking on the door and getting those signatures because she did it and I did it, that there's 75 people who signed it. At least. Does that answer your question? It does, but I it leaves me in an uncomfortable position because I don't have. May I may I. Come in confidence in either one of these? May I comment while I completely respect and understand the process that Landmark uses? The Landmark Commission had ample opportunity and was addressed numerous times regarding the potential opposition. As a matter of fact, when Landmark presented in this building about a month ago, the opposition was prohibited from making any statement to try and clarify numbers which we believe were misrepresented at that time. I personally spoke to the representative from Landmark and told her that she was vastly underestimating and underrepresented in the opposition. So it is my opinion that Landmark had either no intention or just no time, as Carol said, to run down the fact that there were continuously opposition people in these meetings when we were allowed to be there and when it was beneficial to us. Thank you. I was at the looting meeting and. Yes. And it's not our place to speak at that meeting. We understand that. I do. I did sort of keep track of people speaking tonight. And by my accounts, more than half of the proponents who spoke don't actually live in the district, which I find troubling. I did count, I think, five opponents who don't live in the district. But that's all I have for now. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. A couple of themes are emerging. I want to go back for a second to the solar panels. So maybe this is an area that we need to. Do some work on with our code. It was presented earlier by someone that. Well, yes, they are allowed. The restrictions are so restrictive that of everyone who's ever applied to put solar panels in a historic district, every single one of them has been told no. Is that a true fact? Not that I would be aware of. We I'd say we get 3 to 5 applications a month that we review and approve of solar panels. The majority of those are approved administratively. There are occasionally ones that go before the Landmark Preservation Commission. But we it's not the thing that we see the most often, but we see on a fairly regular basis. Is there any way you could just follow up with that data on how many have been applied, how many have been approved, how many have been denied? Is that data available somewhere. And not readily available? We could do some work and start pulling back. And talk about that of mind. Now to the maps. I find the maps also highly. Confusing and contradictory. In fact, as I'm looking at the two of them, I have them both pulled up here. There are places. Where the opposition map is red X is. Not. I can't tell what house they're on top of. The the. The map you've provided has addresses. So the only. Place I can really tell is a glaring. Disparity is on. Osceola, it looks like. You know, on the top left. Part of the map, if you're looking at it, it's all green from the corner in four. One, two, three, four, five, six houses on your map. And there are four. No dots. That looks to be those same exact houses on your map. So, one, can you speak to what might be going on there? And then if you guys can come back up, you did that and you knocked on doors and you knock on doors. You often run into people who don't own the house, rent the house. What kind of verification did you guys do? But how what what what do you think is going on there? So part of it is there are people who signed the petition both for and against or signed one or the other petitions and sent a letter either for and against. So there was one letter that I received prior to submitting a staff report that said I had initially signed the petition, but I'm actually in opposition, so we took them off of the support to the opposed. But I know that there is some level of conflict in that, given that people have voiced to opinions on the same topic. And would you would you guys mind coming up and talking to how did you confirm that it was a property owner and not a renter? When you're going door to door, you're most likely to run into whoever lives there. I can speak to that. I'm Kevin O'Connell, and I was also involved with the data collection and the petition. As you see, I was the holder of the petition and I personally checked all on the assessor's records of the signatures we had. I was aware of one disparity out of the 75 that we have down. I can tell you that I'm aware of three people that were on the proponents or three signatures or addresses on the proponents petition to no longer living in the neighborhood and one that changed their mind. So I'm pretty confident. I think when I ran the last numbers today, I think we were if there were also three who signed both. So if I took those people off like the police, whoever is at their door, yeah, they nullified each other or something. And then, um, the. I don't, I couldn't tell you, but you're pretty confident if. I were to go here through what you guys have provided in terms of petition, name and address, you have verified through the assessor's office that the signatures you had are, in fact the property owners, not the property residents. Correct. I would sign an affidavit to that effect. Like I said, I know of one personally that there was disparity in the records. Versus the signature. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Sure. All right, Councilman Clark. Councilman Espinosa. Mr. O'Connell. Sorry. Both you and Kara should stick around here on this front. So is it. And maybe actually, since you didn't do the poster. But is it your understanding that everybody who signed the petition is now showing up? Showing up as a red X? That's correct, I believe. There are 75 red X's on the map. Okay, Kara, when you do the map that you prepared for us, do you treat that the same way you sort of do with it? I mean, you actually do with a protest petition in that it has to be in order for for it to count as a full building, it has to have the title holders. So if it's only if there are two named parties on the title, it has to be both or anybody who lives at that house. So the petition, the signature petition that was put together by the applicants. That's the manner that they went forward, that you had to have everyone on the assessor record before they provided it to us, says comment that they were in support. And then, like I said, I went through and checked about 75% of those. Just to make sure that they were accurate. So from that sense that what was submitted. To us in what I could check. Those were the property owners. Okay. This is a question for the city attorney. Do you how can you make sure that the exhibit, the petition exhibit is is in your hands over there? Which. The one submitted today by the opposition. Adam Hernandez, Assistant. City Attorney I do not have that exhibit with me like the. One that they just handed to Councilman Black. But the wording here strikes me as is very, very odd. The statement at the top says, Our goal is to get the. No, no one has that yet. Hold on here. Well, everyone should have it on their email, but. Yeah, but we're having people catch up. All right. So it says our goal is to give a voice to residents who are opposed or ambivalent to the formation of the Packard Hill historic district. Adam, do you see that? Yes. Those are two very, very different conditions. Opposition or ambivalence? The code is I mean, are our processes very much treat. Ambivalence is sort of a is a benign position, neither for nor against. So would it be appropriate in a petition like this to indicate a signature and signature as being opposed? Is this really an acceptable petition? I really have no comment on that. This is something that's outside of the designation process. That would be a question more. Appropriate for the people who went through. This. Know, I ask because it sounds like council is giving this some credence, but yet it has the language, both opposition and ambivalence in the statement, the petition statement. So could I ask Council to read the line below that statement, please? We, the undersigned, are concerned citizens who urge our city council. To vote against the. Formation of the district. Thank you. Um, Councilman, do you have another question? So, I mean. It looks like the. Classic fine print. One of these is clearly much bolder than the other and no indication on how this was portrayed. I strongly suggest I mean, I spoke with you at length on how to, how to make this case, um, in, in consistent with the criteria and to put language like that is very concerning. Um, so I did have other questions for Kara. First, I wanted to thank her for the examples that were provided that Councilman Flynn had talked about. Because the there's a. It demonstrated a great deal of creativity that can be explored in landmarks. How can you confirm the 99% approval rate that was mentioned on landmark reviews? What goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission? I couldn't confirm that based on those numbers. It's about I would estimate it's about a 90 to 95%. But I have not run the numbers recently to be able to give a firm confirmation of what's come before the commission and been approved in the last year. Okay. Would there be landscape restrictions and does the approval rate of 90 to 95% also include those reviews as well? So so there is a section in the design guidelines that do address landscape. It's. Basically hardscape mean anything that requires a permit. So if you're looking to put in a fence or retaining wall, so far it requires a permit. So it's basically it's basically hardscape. Yes. It doesn't usually have the same approval rate. Or is it lumped into that now? Yes. So. So that approval rating is what goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission, as I believe what he was speaking to. And so what goes before the commission is about a 90 to 95% approval would be my estimation. And do you know what percent of Denver's city land area is designated or not designated? Our guys person at CPD estimates it at about 4% of the properties within Denver are historic districts or individual landmarks. Okay. Um. That was it. No further questions. Thank you. Councilman Hernan Henderson President, I have a general question. I wonder if anyone else is colder than me and I hope everyone else is cold and I'm not getting sick. Kara, I have a question for you. Since you were there, we have had people come up and talk about the length of time it takes going through Landmark. And I know you can't speak to individual cases, but can you give me some sort of just general? And if you don't know, I think that's perfectly acceptable. Well, as well how long it extends the process, because if you add in third party, it does extend the process to say that it doesn't is not being honest. So could you try to give us an understanding of how long that takes? I can't. And if it's okay, I'll kind of break it down sort of into the three categories I spoke about earlier. So a vast majority of what we do are what we call quick reviews, which is like a replacement. So like when when the hailstorm comes, we'll do a whole bunch of those. That's typically a one day review for us. The smaller projects are typically 10 to 15 business days, just depending on sort of our workflow. We're at sort of peak times summer, so it's probably closer to the 15 day review and those are. For. It can be for like solar panels, smaller rear additions, things that we can approve administratively. And that's about 75 or 70% of what we do. About 30%, give or take goes to the Landmark Preservation Commission. And those typically are a little longer review. There's a four week filing deadline prior to a commission meeting, and during that four weeks, the idea is that staff can work with the applicant to refine the project so that it is something that can be approved before when it goes before the commission, which is why we want to work with the applicant. But that is about a 4 to 6 week time period. If you're doing some larger infill, that is the longest time period as that is a two part review process. So the part, the top example that was given that would be the four week review, I would assume. Typically, yes, there is also for rooftop additions, 80 use which are not allowed by zoning in in this particular district right now. And. In full. I go to the Arnaud's for comment and that is a three week time period. Okay. So it's it's reasonable to say that there are examples where I could go an extended beyond just a 1 to 10 or 15 days. Yeah. Yes. Thank you. Kevin O'Connell, I wanted to ask you a question, and I'm staring at your partition, so I don't I don't believe there is any ill intent of trying to deceive people and everyone and grown adults. You should read what you're saying. But your your first point, I just want to ask quickly, and you could just give me a couple of examples. You say you want to add a voice to people that are opposed as if you were implying that you did not have a voice. And if you could just briefly give a couple examples for why you feel that if you're in opposition, that you did not have a voice? Of course, that I think that speaks to one of the problems with the the ordinance that it's designed to make historic districts. It's not designed to give people a voice who are opposed to having their properties incorporated into a historic district. You know, we we did try to foster conversations with our neighbors. It was very difficult. It almost seemed as though we were being told it's our way or the highway, we're going to do this. So there came a point after a couple of years of this that I decided, well, people, we need to know who's actually not for this. It's easier to say nothing than to stand up against something. Great. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Thank you. Councilman Herndon, I guess. Councilwoman Gilmore. Thank you. President Brooks. Kara, I have a couple questions for you. Um. Back to the landmark designation criteria on the history piece. I know that we have in your report that there's a direct association with historical. Development. And that it's women's history. But we're basically talking about seven individuals, four women and three men. And I'm unclear as to did they reside in. I got a little insight from Mr. Moline when he came up and shared that some of these individuals. Did not live in the district. But I wanted to get more information from you as to the four women and three men. Did they reside in the district? Did they have homes? How long was the duration or did they just have some sort of. Association with. The area? So those were the. People that we highlighted who were or the authors highlighted and then I highlighted in my staff report that resided in the district. So so all the people who were influential in the district, those were people who owned property and or lived in the district, primarily those who lived within the district. And I would also like to if Tom and Lori Simmons are still here, as the authors who did the research, they may have also like more insight than I do as someone who just reviewed the designation. So r r. So when you say reside or owned property, are we clear that all seven of these individuals resided in the district? It's my understanding, yes. Okay. Do we have their addresses? Yes, they are in the designation. I can go and pull those up if you would like. Okay. That would be helpful because I have been looking through all the staff reports and all of the information and I don't find it clearly that they actually resided in what their addresses was so that that would be really helpful. And then to the architecture piece. The second criteria. That it's significant work of a recognized architect or. Master builder. Do you have the number of homes. That. William Quayle built? In the proposed historic district. There's one within the proposed historic district. A number of his. He didn't do a ton of residential. He did a lot of churches, schools, organizational buildings. A number of those have been demolished. So his work is fairly rare now at this point, that is still standing. And so it's an because it's one of the few pieces that are left of his. But it is one property. So there's one property for him. And then how many? By David and Tilden. Cox family, too. Okay. So there's. Three total structures. That. These architects. Yes. In the district. Okay. And then back to the the map. So. I share the concerns of my colleagues because going through on the first map that you had sent us, you know, immediately we started counting up the number of addresses that were on the map, and we came up with 180 addresses. 70 addresses were in support. That comes up to 39%. 22 were opposed for 12%. But was what was most troubling to me was that 88% were non-responsive, and that's 49%. That's the highest percentage. Could you talk a little bit I know that you sent letters out. It sounds like there were some community meetings, but. But what is the process to hopefully get that? What is clearly a majority of at least those addresses that we were able to count up to, to speak with those folks and have a conversation with them. So so I participated in two public meetings that were held in January and February of this year. There were 35 to 40, maybe 45 people at each meeting. So we we spoke with, you know, answered any questions. And then I stayed. And if anyone had any questions afterwards that I was happy to answer with those. We sent out a CPD to notification letters that were to all property owners based on assessor records, so that we were making sure to hit all the property owners and notify them first of the Preservation Commission upcoming meeting. And then as well as letting them know that if it went through that it would go to the planning board. And then providing my contact information, as well as the landmark general landmark in box, if they had questions to send it that way and then sent a second letter in August, pulled the assessor records again and sent another notification letter, making sure that everyone knew that it had gone through and Preservation Commission in the Planning Board and was now starting through the city council process. Okay. All right. I think that's all my questions for right now. All right. Thank you. Thank you. President Brooks. Yep. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilwoman Black backup. Actually, Councilwoman Black. We have Councilwoman Kenny and Lopez and accused that. Okay, they have an ask a question you can each. Thank you, Mr. President. Couple questions, I think, for Kara. Can you just clarify for me very quickly the difference in terms of process for contributing versus non contributing? Building someone who is a non contributing building mentioned to me that they would go through the same process but without the tax credits. And I wanted to clarify that. So, yes, so when you're within the historic district, it goes through the design review process, whether it's contributing or non contributing, the changes that could be allowed to a non contributing are obviously different because that property could be demolished, whereas it's highly unusual for the Landmark Preservation Commission to approve the demolition of a contributing building. So the. They still go through the design review process, but it's slightly more I don't know if lenient is the correct word, but there are probably more exceptions that are approved by the commission or by staff. Okay. Thank you. And you actually touched on my next question, which is about the question of demolition. So there is eventually a lifecycle to a property, whether it be structural or materials breaking down. And so again, we had a speaker who said that you cannot demolish even if you have a structural or, you know, the materials are no longer sound. Is that accurate, that there's there's no end to the lifetime here? They typically it goes to the Landmark Preservation Commission, if it's a contributing structure. And they do not frequently approve demolitions. But if it if there's life safety, if there's something like that that is demonstrated, it could be demolished. It's just not simply that there's something that typically occurs. We. Yeah. And you can't go through an economic hardship process, but that is also fairly rare. Can you just clarify for me? I'm sorry, Mr. President. I'm just. If you let me know if I go too long. But is there a standard that says, like, if you have, you know, if your foundation is shot, you don't have to spend $1,000,000 to redo a foundation just to say, you know what I mean? Like, is there a written standard in the guidelines that have been talked about? There's a written policy that we have that that is available and that they would need to then demonstrate from, you know, from a structural engineer or someone who can say that this is structurally unsound. And you can say that it proved that it can't be salvaged or something like that, then it would go for the then they would review it that way. But yes, they can go and provide that information, but they do have to provide details that it can't be repaired or rehabilitated. Great. Thank you. I have a question for one of the folks who was involved in the protest petition, and I hesitate to wade back into that, but I keep hearing 75 signatures, which is people. And I just want to clarify if every red X is a person or if every red x is a property because those are very different. Happy to clarify that we have over 100 signatures that represents 75 properties, addresses, residents. Yeah. Thank you for clarifying that. And then I don't know if Marie or one of the applicants wants to answer, but did you all have a conversation about a conservation overlay? And if so, what was your reasoning in not pursuing that option or what was what was considered at any point? It might have been early before your application, or it might have been after. But did you have a serious conversation with the conservation? Yeah. Well, let me start by saying that some of us actually have experience trying to create overlays, and that includes pretty much me in the room. I don't know if there are other people and Trevor So we know some of the pitfalls and some of the difficulties with that. We also know that for this particular intent, it being that we want to keep the historic homes in this neighborhood, an overlay doesn't do that and overlay an overlay would probably be more suitable if you had a district which is identical buildings where they all have the same form and the same roof pitch, etc., etc. because then you could take one of them and say, This is our model. If we want to encourage commerce, excuse me, if we want to encourage construction that similar to this, here is the blueprint for what that needs to look like. As we've heard, we have Queen Anne's that are very different from Denver Squares, that are very different from terraces or duplexes as we think of them sometimes. And there just simply isn't an easy way to create an overlay that would mandate one kind of form when we have a mixture, an almost even mixture of four or five different forms. But most of all, we also know from experience, and I'm going to cite the Highlands, not West Highland, but the Highlands which are east of us, where the three overlays that went through recently I think took about ten years. So a, an overlay doesn't stop the loss of historic homes. And also if they take 5 to 10 years to create, we will have lost the neighborhood already, which is why I said in my intro that this is the tool we have available now. Also, I have not heard any kind of serious attempt at defining what an overlay might be. So I don't I don't think that there was a serious attempt at that from the other side now and then. This is my last question, Mr. President. So I wanted to go back to the criteria, and I think I'm clarifying a question that Councilman Gilmore was asking of the staff, but. Correct. Can you clarify for me in some and I read a lot of stuff, so I can't promise to point to whether this was in the application or supporting material and where it might be in the record. But is is the historic contribution of women just based on the named women or it's based also on a higher percentage of ownership of properties by women? So I just wanted to clarify, if we're hanging our hat just on the names of individuals or whether it's other historical facts about the district, because I read somewhere or heard somewhere in the process about this this larger percentage of ownership by women. And I just want to clarify when I'm evaluating the criteria, if that is if I can consider that or if I cannot. So there were there was higher ownership of women in this particular area. There was higher owner. More women who are involved in sort of the development of it in the the selling and buying of the property or in the construction, as well as the women who were named. And then there were the women who, just as a whole that were residing there that were heavily influential in the temperance movement. So it was the the women that were highlighted specifically, as well as those who owned or and or worked and then were involved in social movements, specifically the temperance movement. So and I just want to be really lawyerly here. Sorry. So and those are not just facts that you all have researched about the district, but they are facts that are tied up together in the criteria of the historic meeting, the statutory criteria. So so the other things that you just confirmed are actually relevant to your analysis of the criteria. They're not just side facts. No, no. We feel like this is a good, really good representation of Denver's women's history. And it wasn't something that I think the applicants expected to find in that. And so in finding that they were able to find that these buildings represent a portion of women who lived there and their achievements, and therefore is part of the criteria, because the buildings reflect the history of that time and of that era. And so it reflects the women who lived there, who were involved in the temperance movement that changed the way the area was annexed. And so that is part of our criteria as to why it's there, part of the history. Did that. Clarify? Yes. Thank you for clarifying. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. We're going to pop down to Councilman Lopez. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. One of my questions was addressed, but I just wanted to in hearing the deliberations, I just wanted to ask, I think is it the applicant? Um. For the district. One. I mean, there was a lot of talk about what you can and cannot build in the back as opposed to the front. And it's a little different from. It's a little different from from a overlays on district mean the last overlay zone district that I was able to be a part of was in your district councilman was San Rafael with the O D9 overlay. And I just wanted to ask somebody. On the you might want to ask you want to ask Kara. Yeah. Yeah. So I heard testimony tonight about inability to add rooms, to add space. These are kind of small homes. And if they didn't have a if they wouldn't able to do it with the, you know, expecting kids and the growth of a family, they did have to move. What are some of the things that can be done in a district like this with the typical home that's in this and this area? So in terms of expansion. Rates, so something that would be. Yes. So as I was saying, there are like administrative reviews, which is about 75, 70% of what staff does are 70% of the work that we do. So you can do like rear additions if they're, you know, subordinate to the structure, which just basically means they're inset about four inches on the side and they're not readily visible. So rear additions are something that we review on a daily basis, review and approve on a daily basis. People, if they didn't want to do a full pop up, we often recommend with these types of houses to add dormers and then create space and be able to get a second floor through Dormers either on the side or the rear. You can do a side addition. A side edition would go before the Landmark Preservation Commission, typically because that's more readily visible and depending on how far setback it is. So there are a variety of ways to meet the design guidelines and expand a property, but they do have to meet the design guidelines. And each of that a little each one of those is different, depending on the home. Mm hmm. I mean, I've been on the structure, and it goes in front of the board. Just depending on. So our ordinance says that if it clearly meets the design guidelines and is not readily visible landmarks, staff can approve that the application. If it is readily visible, it's on the front facade or it doesn't very clearly meet the design guidelines. It can go before the Commission and the Commission can approve something, even if it doesn't meet the design guidelines, whereas staff cannot. And so it just depends on the size and the visibility as to whether or not it's something staff can approve or it goes to the commission. Error or how frequent are those kind of applications or no application for those kind of requests in front of the commission? And do you see any from some of the surrounding areas in this historic district? I know we have a bunch of them throughout Denver. So I just you know, I want to see if there's anything around. Yes. I would say Potter Highlands is one of our busiest historic districts. They also can do 80 use as allowed by zoning. So we see a lot of use coming in from there. But we see projects in Wolf and Ghost as well. And I've seen a rare edition, a side edition, seeing dormer scene pop tops. That is not unusual. We see those on a regular basis and get those on an almost daily basis. Okay. I just I want to I wanted to get a sense of how frequent this can happen. And it just may appear like it was almost impossible with some of the testimony. So I'm just trying to get that that sense of of just that that sense from you as somebody who sees it on a daily basis. Yeah. And I would say that it also depends on in, you know. How clearly the application, you know, like our timeframe depends on how clearly the application is in either the materials, is there a site plan, do the plans have dimensions? You know, so, so just getting a complete application sometimes can take a little bit longer, but with a complete application, we also highly encourage people to do come in for a pre application. Meeting with us allows us to give the opportunity to provide comment without a large expense in to architects to say we think that this would be something that would be, you know, administratively approvable or something that would go to the commission. But we like to provide that opportunity before people spend a lot of time, money or effort on a design that would not clearly meet the design guidelines. And it makes for a smoother process. What are some of the restrictions? And my last question, Mr. President, if I am able to proceed, is on landscaping and some of the some of the details on the landscaping. What well. What do you regulate and what's not allowed? I mean, I trying to get a grasp on that as well, too. Right. So so we don't regulate vegetation. We don't regulate your trees and we don't regulate what you plant. It's basically in general can be boiled down to hardscape. Does it require a permit? Are you trying to pave something? Are you trying to put in a fence in you know, in this particular district, the Denver Hill, which is sort of that role, is not a character defining feature of this particular district. So there would be higher retaining walls and that kind of thing, that or fencing in the front that would be approvable and would meet the design guidelines for this district because the Denver Hall is not part of the character defining feature of that district. Okay. That that that does clarify a lot for me because I think I mean, like I mentioned before, I mean, we've seen a few of these go by and sometimes it's easy to confuse these with overlay district uses and and the intricacies based on what wherever but whatever part of the city that you're on. I just want to try to get familiarized with what is a use by right in in in a universe like this in a situation like this. So so what you're saying is through the process, it's not uncommon to do additions that are not readily visible from the front pop tops, things like that. The other thing that you clarified was landscaping. It's not uncommon to be able to put a retaining wall if you can, if need be. And I think a lot of these things require permits anyway. I mean, I know I know anything, any time. I mean, I'm guilty of this. Put a six foot fence up because I thought, hey, I could put up a six foot fence. Look at me. I could build a six foot fence, I. I had to go get a permit after the fact. And it's happened a long, long time ago, but I didn't realize it. How did you realize that you needed a permit for a measly six foot fence? Okay. Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Well, I like to turn myself in for this. We'll have the inspectors out there tomorrow. Let's see. You know, I'm going to. I know everybody's getting back in the queue, but I'm a skip. Skip down to New and Ortega. You haven't gone yet. Go ahead. Okay. Oh, Marie, can I ask you a question? Help us with the last mapping or survey question. But did you did you survey residents in the neighborhood, in the district? Yes. Do you mean in terms of did we ask for a response? Yes. Yes. Can you describe the process? Yes, absolutely. So we started knocking on doors about 20 months ago, January, February of 2016, and we invited people for neighborhood coffee. Some people showed up. Some people did not. We continued door knocking. If anyone said that they were in support, we asked them to sign a form, like I mentioned. Later on we started pressing a little bit harder. So we were asking people for a response whether yay or nay. And we started doing that in December of 2016. And we had a super simple two question survey on the Internet to for people to respond and only. 17 people who are opposed took that survey to say they were opposed. So there was definitely opportunities along the way to engage and be part of the neighborhood conversation and to even just say, I am not supportive of this. Without having to face anyone personally, if that's a concern. But only 17 people took that opportunity. How many participated in the survey? Well, a lot of people, I think, at that point who were in support had already signed signature sheets. So they may have not taken that survey, but we did put it on, I think three or four printed fliers, at least three of which went out by U.S. mail to all registered owners, the property records. And we also put it on numerous emails, although we could, of course, only email people who had given us an email address and not everyone chose to do that. But we had 165 emails, I think, for our email list by the end of the effort. And you're surveying how many were in support. How many were in support in the survey that we submitted, including all the forms, 76 people. 26 and 17 against. 17 against that, let us know that way. In addition, four people emailed us, so we reported 21 against and 7 to 6 for when we submitted both to LUDI and to you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman. No pop down to Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. Councilwoman Kinney. Yes. My question about the guidelines for the non contributing properties. I want to ask how the procedures are different and I'm going to direct this to you, how the procedures are different today for someone who wants to just do a renovation on their home versus having this designation in place. Is the timing any faster? You know, we have dedicated staff to work on landmark applications, whereas sometimes it feels like your your application for your permit gets in and it sort of disappears into this deep, dark hole and you're not sure when you're going to get it back. So can you just sort of define the difference between the two? So we're basically the four properties that are either an individual landmark or within a historic district. We're the first. Stop in the permitting process. So it comes to us first and it goes through our review, whether it's a quick review, a staff review, or a review that goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission, we issue a certificate of appropriateness that we email to the applicant and then say, okay, this is your first step in the permitting process . Please attach this as well as the plans that they have submitted to us. We stamp in sign and date, and so we tell them to submit those stamped plans and the certificate of appropriateness to their next step in the permitting process, whether it's residential or. So typically, how long does that first process take? So like I said, it just it depends on the scope of the project. So if it's. A complete application. If it's a complete application that landmark staff can administratively review, it's a 10 to 15 business day. Right now, we're kind of at like peak season in sort of our business. And then if it's a quick reroof, it's a day. If it's a longer process, then it goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission. And that's typically, I would say, 4 to 6 weeks, just depending on the timing of when. It gets, you know, on the other side, if someone's coming in just to do a riff and they're not in a historic district, how long it takes to get that turnaround, I. Believe that they have just implemented. And so this is beyond me. So I will just give you this is what I believe. They have implemented a quick review that is an online and really within the day getting the permit for that is my understanding too. We think that that. Application process that's expediting them for the non historic areas will eventually fold over to the historic areas. We typically will probably review it because we review are just our design guidelines are different than the zoning code or the building code. So that's probably still going to be reviewed by us. We do try it like we still we try to keep the the quick permits to a really like a 24 hour review period. So but I don't foresee that that that would likely go away in the near future. And if someone wants the pre application afforded to them so that they are making sure before they actually submit for their permit that they've got to complete application. How long does it take to get into to do that? So there's a pre application, it's a it's a form on our website. It's a really simple form that just basically provide some contact information. Here's what we're looking to do and then they'll provide us some literally like back of the napkin sketch kind of stuff that we get. We will then contact them. It'll be assigned to a staff member and we have staff meetings twice a week and it's normally handed out at that point and then that staff member will contact them and we typically try to do it within about a week of receiving it to set up an appointment that works both for us and for the applicant to meet and and discuss it. And typically that process is just to help them make sure they've got a complete application so that when they submit, it's not something that gets sent back for more information. Yeah. It's to help them that and it's also to provide them with some guidance as to what we feel like would meet the design guidelines and kind of ask them, you know, ask them what they're looking to do and then provide them with some guidance of what they can expect. If you are doing an infill, it's something that they would need to do and then we want to provide them with the step so that they have a thorough understanding of what it really is going to look like. We want them to know what that process will be. And my last question, how how often is it that you actually see an applicant having to hire an architect to assist them in doing some of the improvements that they want done? We get, um, we get some architects depending on the scale of the project. So if it's a, if it's a project that would require an architect anyway anyway, then we're typically going to see that. Or we would recommend that we also get things a lot from general contractors or. The garage. Contractors or the guy who puts up the fence. So, yes, I do have one last question. If if. A homeowner is looking for someone that has had contracting experience with older homes in historic districts. Do you all provide recommendations? We do not provide recommendations. However, we recommend they contact historic Denver, who may be able to provide them with recommendations. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. All right. We're back at the top. Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm not sure who can answer that, but I believe when you started, Kara, you said there were 17 applicants and that they all lived in the district. But of people who came and spoke, I thought I heard three people say they were applicants but did not live in the district. Can you clarify that? I can't clear, but I know that there are some who own property, but are. I don't live in the city and county of Denver, but they own a property within the historic district, so it's like a rental property. So there are a combination of that. And I would let Marie perhaps speak more specifically to that. The number I believe there were only a couple of people who did not actually reside in the district. But I would actually like to give you a read the specifics. I think it might be an easier answer than that. So I'm just going to scroll. Applicants Jamie Chester will Chester live in the district are here. Carmen Trio is or was here. Is here. Thank you. Iris Elkabetz is here. Who lives in the district. Matthew Gibbler is not here but lives in the district. You don't have to read them all. Oh, sorry. They all live in the district. I'm sorry. I was trying to confirm that. Well. So let me just scroll without talking then. Yes. Yes. I think they all live in the district, from what I can tell, and with very few exceptions, also own property in the district. Of course, the exception would be if somebody lives with somebody who owns property in the district. Okay. Thank you. And then. Kara, I guess this is for you against a lot of the opponents have expressed a willingness to. To look at other opportunities or a less contentious way or consensus or a compromise. I typed all those words up, but what are the other options? Maree addressed the issues with the conservation overlay. What are the other options that are available that would preserve the character of the neighborhood? That might not be as extreme that maybe the two groups could agree upon? I mean, conservation overlay is generally the other tool that community planning in development offers to people if they're having questions about what their options are. You know, it's a different process than design review. There isn't the design guidelines that go along with it. It doesn't prohibit demolition. So so it's a different process and different, you know, it goes more through the zoning code than through the design guidelines. But a conservation overlay would probably be the other option that we would recommend if someone was going to look to do that. They. Don't mean exactly the same. Goals. But you know that other neighborhoods have considered that as an alternative to landmark designation. Yes. So you're going to you have to come to the mike and speak. So another tool to preserve single family or single storey structures would be a rezoning so that the Packard Hill historic or the area for the proposed Packard Hill historic district would allow for it to use accessory dwelling units, which you could add that square footage in a secondary structure, then you wouldn't need a larger home office, a guest quarters. So that structure could could accommodate the square footage for a single storey dwelling. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. Let's see. On if a modern house, a non contributing structure. Modern House. Cube house. Burns down. Can they build a clubhouse. In a historic district? It would need to go through the design guidelines. So probably if it met with combat, you know, is it compatible? And we're looking at like sort of mass scale height, some of the examples that we provided to to to see does it meet the design guidelines. So if that property met the design guidelines, yes. But it would probably my guess would be is that there would need to be changes to it for it to meet the design guidelines. Okay. Thank you. All right, uh, Councilman Espinosa, back up again. What date was the application filed? I'm sorry. I have to look at my staff report. I want to save the beginning of June or the end of May. I would. I'd have to actually check my staff report to give you the precise date. Okay. So I can do that if you'd like. Really quick. No, I saw the the notification. Was on June 15th. Was that is that immediate or is that a week later or so? We so the notification date for the for our letters is required to be no less than 25 days, but no more than 40 days prior before the Landmark Preservation Commission. It typically ends up going out about a month before the commission meeting. So so that notification letter is to notify of the Landmark Preservation Commission public hearing. So that would mean then it came in in May. It could have been. Yeah. I'm sorry. I would have to double check my staff report. I can grab that if you'd like. Yeah. I just I'm trying to track it down because several of these I mean, all these signatures, not all, but four of the signatures on here predate the that June 15th day. So trying to. Hold on one moment. Okay. If it's in the fall right at Stanford Port, I'll go ahead and look it up. Yeah, I look at the stuff, but. Any other questions? No, thank you. Okay, great. Uh, Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. Kara. Hello. I want to thank Councilwoman Gilmore for helping us focus back on the actual criteria in the code that we're supposed to base this on. And so I want to ask my remaining questions about that. I think there's no question that the first overriding requirement that it maintains historic and physical integrity is is certainly well met. And I don't have an issue with that. And the last one relate to a historic context or a theme. I think a case has been made for that, although in my judgment, in previous cases, I think I could manage to fit probably my 35 year old Melody Holmes house into that as well. So I don't know that that's really helpful. But so let me go to the specific history, architecture and geography. And you have there is no geographical criteria that was even considered here or was it and rejected? That was not a part of the designation application that we received. Okay. So the applicants never asked for, although the commission and the staff have actually added things that were not requested by the applicant. Did you consider the geography make a special contribution to Denver's distinctive character or anything like that? We reviewed the landmark staff, reviewed the application as it was submitted to us. Land Preservation Commission has in the past recommended have. What is the difference in staff's mind if not the commission? You can't speak for the commission, but the historical criteria A is have direct association with historical development of city, state or nation. What's the difference between having an association which would try to build a case that almost I could associate almost anything with the historical development of the city? And so what distinguishes that from a direct association, and why does this meet that criteria? So this is you know, it initially started out as a community outside of Denver and then it was annexed into Denver. It was so it's directly associated with the development and growth of the community of Denver, the trolley line that was established further, the growth of Denver. And so this is a directly related to people who had been within the sort of urban core of Denver and had moved outside there than outside the city and county of Denver. And then they were annexed back into Denver. That directly ties to the growth and development of Denver. Okay. Couldn't I say that about almost anything? It was annexed into Denver. It would. You know, what would what would they what would not fit that criteria? There. There would be like there's a lot of properties that we get that someone asks the question about and we're like, that doesn't meet the design guys. I mean, say that doesn't meet our criteria as something that, you know, that the direct rent, the direct tie with the trolley development and how those came up at a fairly simultaneous time in our intricately linked to each other. It ties it closely to the development. And the direct. And now the next one is see history, see, have direct and substantial association with a person or group of persons. And so what is the difference in staff's mind between something that has an association with a person or group of persons versus having a direct and a substantial association? There has to be some kind of a difference. Yes. So, um, so I pulled up the staff report that talks about and these are just some of the people that were highlighted and that the fact that they did, they did live in the you know, live in the community. They were there for an extended period of time. They had influence on the development of the city and county of Denver. They were residents in that. And so there was a there was a strong tie between the people who lived there and what they did to influence the city and county of Denver. Okay. Did did Ben Stapleton actually live there or did he own property? Do we know? I had no idea that he lived there. He lived there. I believe he lived there and moved to a couple of different properties. Okay. It sounds like somebody out there is saying that he did or didn't. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. That's probably not a good thing. And let me go to architecture, Mr. President, and there's two other criteria in there. It must embody distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type. And I've had problems with this one before. And I think, Councilwoman Sussman, her committee was going to look at revising this. I think that's something that needs revising. That's a comment. But again, my melody home down in southwest Denver has a distinguishing characteristics of a suburban tract house. What would not what would I mean? Every building, every physical structure embodies its characteristics, doesn't it? I mean, how what would not meet this criterion? Well, so part of it is, does it have the integrity to convey that significance? So does it actually look like what it used to look like? How many changes have been made to it? So the physical integrity and the architecture are really strongly tied on this criteria. And then finally, Mr. President, there must it must be the significant work, not just the work, but a significant work of a recognized architect or master builder, which buildings in this proposed district fit that to be, to be. So there are three properties. There's the the two properties. There's two stone properties on Lower Boulevard. The gargoyle and the yeah, yeah. Yeah. The Coxes are recognized master stonemasons and Master Stone Builders and these were two properties that they both resided in, but use different techniques in order to display their abilities. Right. And then for the William Quail House. And where's that at? Um, I'll have to double check off the top of my head. So on the corner of 32nd Avenue in Osceola. Oh, okay. The one where the Marilyn Mills lived. So. Yeah. And that that's one of its because there's not many works of his remaining left that's why is this a significant example. Are there any other houses of the 173. Other than these three. No. These are the three that represent the works of a master architect or builder. Okay. Two of those already are landmarks. They already are. Yes, they are. We're using them again. Yet because they're with it now. Toward the district. Because if they're strong enough to rise to an individual, you know, a property to be an individual landmark has to be a really strong case on its own. So if they're strong enough on their own to be okay, they would also be strong enough within it. What was the staff's consideration in saying that those two buildings, the Cox buildings on Lowell that are already landmarked, that their significance, their architectural, their master builder significance is strong enough that we should landmark a district. Three and a half blocks beyond it. It was part of the district. If that was the only if that was the only reason why the district was being landmarked was for those three properties, then no, it would not meet the criteria as an aggregate of the whole. It contributes to the significance of the district. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. That's it. All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilman Herndon. Name is President Carter. Just the last one for you. I want to make sure I keep this in questions, not comments. You. We spent a lot of time a couple of years ago dealing with this in Park Hill. And so I want to make sure. The Park Hill District. I might call L.A. with historic Denver just in case. I want to get the numbers right. There is a consideration of a historic district in Park Hill. How many homes were a part of that. I want to say? 745. 7700. Sorry. Okay. And so and I am sitting with questions, Mr. President. And do you and I'm good. And I want to make sure I got the number correct. 700. 700, correct. Yeah. The proposal. Would never became a full application, so it's not quite the. Same. Apples to apples. But there is a national existing national register historic district there that has just shy of 700 properties in it already. Perfect. Thank you so much. And if. They're no longer moving forward with it because they're now doing the conservation overlay. And I don't think that was a comment. I'll speak more that during the comments. Mr. President, I am going to thank you. Heard it. And you know, Councilman, I really admire your discipline right there. Okay. First. Good morning to everyone. Good morning, Adam. I have a question for you on just distinguishing between landmarks criteria. Just for the record, landmarks criteria and what are criteria is a city council. So when Landmark looks at the criteria in Unicode 33. The criteria. That Kara has laid out in her staff report. If the. Application meets those criteria, the LPC will recommend approval to City Council. City Council's review criteria is rather broad. You have. You can consider a wide variety of issues, including the written views. Of property. Owners. But you're not. Restricted to those views. Either you have wide latitude to. Make your decision or. Just just wanted to. Wanted you to clarify that for the record in case we drifted astray here. I got the last couple questions here, Kara, real quick. No one's talked about design review. Should this, uh, pass or fail pass? Um, there will be a specific design review for this context. Is that correct? Yes. Well, the design guidelines are citywide. But we will look at like, what is the character defining? What are the character defining features of this particular district? Like I said, like. Who will who will do that? Will that be the staff or will that be a community, you know, representative stakeholders in the in the district. So there will be the development of what we call character defining features, which are at the back of the design guidelines. I'd say like probably the last half or so of the design guidelines or character defining features that have been written for a portion of the historic districts, the ones that we see the most activity in. And that is a process that goes through both staff as well as the community. So we will contact the community, will ask what they feel is important. Staff will draft the character defining features, submit them to the community, to the Arnaud's. It's a very collaborative process that is eventually been approved by the Landmark Preservation Commission. Okay. Now, should this get approved, that will be that will start right away. Yeah. It would be something that would start, you know, at some point this year we would start the process of going through that. We have a lot of districts that don't have character defining features as well, and we rely partially on what is in the application and what just are the what is the character of that particular neighborhood. And look at those features. Okay. I was harkening back to to Whelton when we did design that. We got its own design guidelines. Had its own deal. Will this not have its own design guidelines? No. We don't want to create historic districts that, you know, each historic district has its own design guidelines. We want basically. Why not? Because then we'd have 52 different design guidelines. And that becomes more confusing both for staff, the commission and applicants. And so having one set of design guidelines that that fits everything other than the lower downtown design guide, they have their own design guidelines and five points have their own design guidelines because they are very unique into themselves . Yeah. That kind of to me would say that you should keep doing it, but that's a whole nother conversation for another day. Let me let me jump in to Mary. Um. I just want to say this is I have a bunch of questions, but seeing as it's the next day, let's just get into this real quick. So you met with me? Yes. In five points. Yes. And you gave me the number? Yes. 70 something. Before supporting, I forget the number who were against maybe 1015 and then some who had not been contacted. Um, you know, and I continue to ask you, you know, stay on this. Keep me abreast of this situation. And it seemed like as the process move down the road, here we have this. And so help me make sense of what happened from. You know, you've been you've been involved with it from the beginning. What happened to we have a larger contingent here. I pulled I was a little surprised, too, given that we had we had done a ton of outreach and we had really asked people for feedback. Like I said so many times in emails and so many times in letters, etc., etc.. And even though there was a very easy way to provide feedback, but there was also you could call or you could email. It was surprising to me that only 17 people chose to respond to say that they were in opposition and another four, like you mentioned, via email. And then as of Thursday noon, that number still stood. The Internet survey is still alive. And I think it also corresponds with the number of people who wrote into the city to say that they were opposed. Very close. So let me let me get to that, because that's really important. So 17 people as of last week. 17 for this from the survey and four via email. So 21. Okay. And hold it right there. Kamal, call you up real quick. When did you. I don't mean to interrupt you. I just want to make sure that I'm on the same. And when did you hear about the the number of folks that we have here? So I didn't receive the petition until Friday morning on. Friday morning, last week. Last week. So I had spoken with them and told them. They said, you know, we have a petition and like, you know, go ahead and submit that to us. So we haven't we can put it on the on the record in that we can see that. But we we did not get to see that much public comment in opposition. Like the staff report said, I think 85 187 individuals commented in support and 35 to 37 in opposition committed directly to CPD. Okay. Real quick, what was the timeframe between Landmark Commission and Ludie and Planning Board? So the Preservation Commission was June 18. Planning Board, I believe, was August 2nd and Ludie was August 22nd. And at that time you still held at 70? I mean, actually, I hadn't received until after Rudy. I hadn't received any formal public comment in opposition in sort of in writing. They they come to the Preservation Commission. Okay. They hadn't. They helped me. Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. I forgot your name. Kevin. Kenny. You're going to represent the those in opposition because you knocked on doors and you're pretty organized around that. So, I mean, that's 60 days. Yeah, I do believe it went past that. So we had the public meetings back in January and February and there was a substantial, I'd say, resistance to this. However, this goes along with the problem of the process. So we're having community meetings, but we weren't being heard. We had a very short time to answer, ask questions. And there were a lot of people who didn't live in the district at these meetings and making comments. So we had a quick frustration and. I understand all of it. But what I don't understand is these are very public meetings. Sure. And so when I say Public Landmark Commission Ludy, I've had very controversial things. People don't have any problem telling me that they don't like something. So that's what I'm trying to understand as 17 to 70. Yeah, I just 60 days. We did have a substantial showing at the Landmark and you can see that in the record. I think we had more speakers than they did from the district. Okay. So this this shouldn't be a surprise. I have been in the media. You have been on record saying it's split. Nobody wanted to hear it. Okay. Thank you. I have a question for Councilman Espinosa. Councilman, did you get a chance? Excuse me, Councilman Clark, your head's right there. Did you get a chance to meet with the opponents? And did you did you solicit their input? Did you meet with them and talk about ways that there is an opportunity for a compromise? Actually, five of them attended one of my community coffees on April 23rd of this year. And at that point in time, the arguments were hyperbolic. One of the gentlemen who spoke tonight, one of the gentlemen, has a very legitimate concern because he he has mentioned here that he's in a two year long process of designing the house and well to get to the point. One of my concerns is, is a bulk of these signatures are on February 12th. And several of them. Pages of these signatures predate that meeting. And to be honest, this is the first today at 937 was the first I had seen it. Okay. And let me just so that I think that's the point that I didn't know which is important. But let me just ask this very critical. Did you specifically reach out to the opposition? The sit down with them? No, because aside from Mr. O'Connell and the four members, I only have 11 emails in this entire time from Jane from from from the inception until this last question and then we're gonna go to comments. Sir, can you come back up? I just want to ask you one quick question. Did you or anyone who is in opposition specifically reach out to your council person and say, we are in opposition towards this, we don't want this to happen? Absolutely. Through email. Yes. And in person. I was one in attendance at the meeting. In the meeting. Okay. All right. Thank you. All right. This concludes the the hearing of counsel Bill 903. It is now closed. Comments by members of Council Counsel Min Espinosa. Well, I'm glad that you had that last line of question, because that's really, really concerning to me. Just see the sort of how early I mean, the first public meeting was discussed in February, and immediately there was this reaction and I'm not privy to it aside from the occasional emails, mostly from Mr. O'Connell, you know, to give really the whole reason I put myself and offered myself up in this position was to give community a voice. And so I worked with other members of the community to make sure that their notifications went out and said, Look, this is absolutely important, that there's outreach and you're communicating with everybody. And so I know that at least two full mailers went out independently of the city. And so it's very, very difficult for me to sort of hear that, you know, why wasn't there a petition saying, Councilman Espinosa, we would like you to consider a conservation overlay and get me overwhelming signatures with that, because I can't direct I can't direct our CPD staff to do these things. But when I have the weight and gravitas of a aam a plethora of signatures that helps move the needle. I mean you know because we've done it time and again. So it's it's it's disheartening. I didn't want to speak I mean say that but you know it's you know I look at this and then I'll be honest to my colleagues here. One of the things that really concerns me and this is somewhat cynical to state, but there were, in fact, more more homeowners in the district that spoke here tonight. Not many more, but then of the 2020 plus. Speakers that spoke in opposition. Ten of them are owners of non contributing properties. And so well one of the speakers spoke about how it's just 18% of non contributing. A third of those non contributing properties are here, really opposing design review. And it's not lost on me that that is a vital. Part. To this preservation effort is to shape and to, you know, to to sort of recognize the eclectic nature, the time, the progression that has occurred here and how all those different eras and epics have resulted in this heterogeneous community that that can actually be captured and codified and generated significant figures and generated monumental works of architecture next to more vernacular, and that they sort of all spoke to their era. And then, you know, the whole process of this is a simple design review. It doesn't preclude non contribution structures from being torn down and replaced. One of the requirements is that they be of their era and so mass and scale are not the end of the world as an architect. Those are our tools. That's what people were working with for decades, up until now. And that's what architects can work with going forward. And you can do modern in a whole bunch of different shapes. You know, if you looked at my own house, you would not recognize that, you know, you could not define it from the outside versus the inside, because there are two different things. And that's one of the things the attitudes that you have with landmark designation is, you know, what goes on inside your house is up to you , what goes on, how your your property addresses the public realm. It has to speak to the criteria that is shaped that designation. And for 52 times in this city, it has been acceptable or I think that's what it was mentioned. And so, you know, I have a I have a a nice letter here from and I've wrote a bunch of notes on it from as Gallagher who just. You know, I left this today encouraging myself and my colleagues to to. To support this, recalling the effort that he had in LoDo and there was massive opposition to that designation and we can all acknowledge that what we have there today is significant. And I think you all pretty much did acknowledge today that what you have today is significant with or without any additional restrictions. So. I went off script, but as one of the other speakers spoke, you know, probably better off that way. The. And it wasn't scripted. This was these are notes that I was writing through throughout this this evening, because I'll be honest. You know. Michelle, are you still here? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I put up flashing on her rooftop dormers in her non contributing house and. And. And so I have people that I have known for a long time on both sides of this debate, not just new people. You know, I don't separate you all like that and. And, you know, I was torn. So that's why I was paying attention. I really don't I don't like being surprised like this because that is exactly what I don't want to. I would like us to come together. I mean, you guys were together before this division. Unless we just took we dug in our heels in February and said, oh, hell no, we're not going to agree to anything. You know, but I don't know. We had one conversation. No. No, no, no, no. So, so. So. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. We're just making comments. Councilman, don't engage the folks who are in the public right now. We're just making comments there. They've had their chance at it. This is your chance. Let's just try not to engage. Thank you. Sorry about. And I didn't want to engage because it's your. What you're hearing is my own sense of of of disappointment in myself. You know, it's just sort of not. I feel like I have a good pulse on my community and and would like to have known is if there was an opportunity but. Anyway, back to this. You know, back in March of 2016, following, you know, we had three individual homes and properties come before this council. All three were denied. In each and every case, members of this council said to bring in a historic district, not just one offs and individual landmarks, but that get the people together, define that area and make, in effect, change that way. So to help educate my constituents, we hosted a historic preservation forum at Edison Elementary. It had 100 different hundred people there in attendance, over 100 people in attendance from all parts of the district, including a significant portion. Of West Highland. And we addressed giving them the tools what what the advantages disadvantages were historic districts were discussed, conservation overlays were discussed. And it was a very educational process, a community initiated. Initiatives are an important tool. There are zoning code. I mean, R or ordinance. I mean our municipal code. Has created. And so these do these affect every single city, county resident of the city and county of Denver? And they're there to to to address matters of important concern for all communities in Denver. Not everybody is well equipped to take advantage of them. And it's not an easy process. And that what you see here was not an easy feat. The fact that there were 17 applicants, you know, like you said, that is. That is, there's more applicants that are affected, you know, than the number of contributing structures that were represented today by opposition. And after after months or years, seemingly two years, what was mentioned of dealing with this? So. With a split constituency. I have to ask myself, what are the consequences of this vote? Either way, is the character history architecture that merits protection? Yes, no doubt. And the research offered the existing built environment that you can go see and an experience today. And the capable individuals on the Landmark Preservation Commission all agree. That the qualities are there, the history is there, the narrative is there, the substance, the things that matter to this sort of designation are there. And the people believe that that is worth preserving and honoring going forward. There are there are a pair of additional I mean. Sorry. Are there a pair of additional required reviews to do certain work. Permitted work. Yes. Ten week process that that preliminary thing. And then your actual review. Are they as onerous as being described? No, not by definition. I can tell you there are good architects and there are bad architects and some that know what they're doing and some that don't. And it's hard to know as a layperson, who that person is. But there's you know, you can find them that they can help actually expedite not expedite but but really understand the what they're dealing with and to help you address your, you know, capture your needs and make it work within this criteria. The zoning code. The zoning code and the building code dwarf. These design guidelines dwarf them. And there are no pictures or diagrams in the building code. That entire book is solid text. And more of that applies to any individual project than this, you know? So can you still build, expand and grow? With designation? Yes. There is a clear desire within the community to preserve the character. And many, many people on both sides acknowledged the important qualities of the place that this is and the allure of this community. Only one finding tonight acknowledges the value and integrity of this history in the place and takes measures to inform the future while acknowledging the significance of this place and still accommodating growth and change. David Broadwell, our long standing city attorney, talked about it. You mentioned guts. I think that's what Dennis Gallagher's letter here sort of implies, too, about the tough decisions. And he even acknowledged that tonight we were going to have a tough decision. That's where this is for me. Would I like do I think that we could actually hammer out a way forward? I have no idea because we have not had that conversation. Do I know that that takes resources and technical ability that are at our disposal but are here? Yes, but I don't think, you know, that is a that is a heavy lift. It took Hyland five years to do that. And the rate of change, then that predated the the mean post that followed immediately with the recession. In these in this condition. We're losing history at an alarming clip. And if you'd been here over the two years and all the other. Conversations we had about where all the demolitions in Denver are occurring, 80 over 80% of them are in District one for an entire city. 80% of the demolitions are here. So. Many here speaking for this than are many here speaking for. Are impacted by this either in the proposed district, I mean, are impacted by historic districts, either in the proposed historic district or from adjacent, adjacent, landmark districts, or even heard from others not fearful of this process. If this goes through and I believe, as the LPC did, that it should, I suggest you this was me being tongue in cheek earlier. I suggest you need to change the name to gutsy woman women. Historic District. Sorry, guys. There's a lot of you. You know, I apologize for for for being thrown off by this, because what I was trying to to do in my own personal narrative on this was to recognize. That our streets right now in this part of town, you have things that other parts of District one wish they had. You have some great porches and people hanging out. Dog owners, no dog owners. People meet. You know, there's just so many strong connections among you all. How do we you know, I did not want to be the lightning rod. I actually wanted to say, look. And I don't know how my colleagues can vote, but if they vote, we're where I think, which is that this would be the right thing long term. I think in years time. I mean, I think tomorrow you'll recognize that, hey, this place is still as awesome as the day I moved here. And it will be awesome years to come and it is the right place to raise my family. It is the right place to fight for my dog park. It's the right place to fight for bike lanes is the right place to slow down traffic. It's the right place to encourage local business. It is. Quality throughout. And that you guys made it that way. And you guys will continue to make it that way and that this community is stronger because there's debate, but it's stronger because you will continue to clink glasses on porches and hang out and acknowledge and won't hold that grudge. You will continue to move on and say, look, let's work on these damn sidewalks. You know, let's support Cashman to get that money over to District One, level these things out and improve this neighborhood in the ways we can't. So I, I mean, I've rambled way, way too long, but I just, you know, I, I think I mean, I don't think I know. That it is a gutsy vote to say with this sort of the mix that we seem seemingly have in this room. But there are 83% of these properties that aren't even here. And that should also speak. Volumes that. Homeowners. In this area impacted by this area, I hope notified by this process. Are are also essentially looking to you all to and to us to just follow through with this decision. So with that, I've rambled way too long. I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of this landmark designation. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman, her. Name is president and thank you all for being here. And hopefully I said that all my other colleagues don't have to. So we can be brief and get you all home before one. People say this all the time and you get so offended when they say, I feel your pain because I typically don't. But I actually do because a year and a half ago, this was going right in Park Hill. And I remember hosting that community meeting at McAuliffe where Carol was there. God bless her. She did a really good job. And I watched neighbors go at each other in a way that I hadn't seen Park Hill do before. And I had multiple meetings with the proponents. I had emails and conversations with the opposition. You would drive through Park Hill and you would see the red signs stop historic districts. You would see the yellow signs and support. And I sat down, I said, Well, you all go to mediation to see if there's something you can agree on this. And people looked at me and they didn't think it was possible. And they went to mediation and they found common ground. 700 homes on common ground. I met with them a couple of months ago and they're moving forward with an overlay. It's possible. And it's not going to take 5 to 10 years. I was I was respect, Maria. She said it takes that long as we're moving forward with Park Hill, it's not taking that long. So if there is a way community members can come together and find a solution so council doesn't have to make a vote that will just make one side angry or the other. That's what I want to strive for. And there has been so much developmental pressure on Northwest Denver, so I get it. I absolutely get it and understand. But I can tell you, representing Northeast Denver, for a community that feels the exact same way, there is an ability to do that. And I wish that that was just a conversation that happened because one of the opposition members spoke today and said, I would have considered an overlay. And then Marissa, well, we didn't hear you say anything about it. And so I sit there and say, well, why didn't that happen? Because if you vote in support of this. Then that's it. The district is there. But if you say I'm supporting opposition. That still gives you all the opportunity to come together and say, how do we preserve this community? Because from what I hear, you both want to do that. And so. I'm if there was. If there was not the ability for an overlay, I would vote in support. I would because I do believe in and the preservation of our homes. But I believe there's another option that can be accomplished, that the communities should come together and do so because we're doing it right now in Park Hill. And it's the same thing when it comes to the numbers. The numbers were different. Who's in support? Who's opposition? Depending on who I spoke to and Park Hill would tell me which way that was tilting. And so I just see so many similarities and I'm excited that they they came together and I hope you all will as to I hope you all will as well. And so I'm voting no, not because I'm against the historic but believe another avenue to move forward because we're doing it. And I hope you all will, too, because seeing neighbors seeing neighbors get torn apart for that was just it's painful. It really is. And I hope you all can heal no matter which way this vote goes. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Herndon and Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you all for being here so late. I really appreciate your passion, Ron Johnson said. We all love our neighborhood to death on both sides or something like that. And it's apparent you all love your neighborhood, which is really, really great, Mary. And I can't remember your name, but you took me on a really nice tour in the summer. Thank you very, very much. I agree that your neighborhood is worthy of protection. When I said goodbye, I said good luck getting people to support it. And I referenced the Christina Park vote that we had last year. 92% of the people were in favor and zero people showed up at the hearing in opposition to it. Zero. And there were 176 homes in that. And that is a conservation overlay. I've been pretty consistent in these votes and I feel like when you are taking away someone else's property rights, you have to have a pretty strong case. I am troubled by the number of people who are opposed to this. I think it's about half and half. As I said earlier, about half of the speakers in favor of it tonight don't even live in the district. But I, I agree that 70 about 75 of them are in support of it. John Olson, I quote, you don't deter neighborhoods voice but half the neighborhood is opposed to it. And I just I feel like I have to honor your wishes. But you have all said you love your neighborhood, you want a compromise, you want to come up with collaborative solutions. And I believe you when you say that. And I agree with what Councilman Herndon just said. So I hope that you all can do that. I also agree, as many people said, that as a city, we need to fix this process. I believe that it is deeply flawed, and I don't think that private property owners should be put in the position of having to fend to defend themselves. They are on trial, so hopefully on our end we can get to work on that. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Dr. Sussman. Oh, thank you, Mr. President. And at the risk of repeating what my first two colleagues have said, what I was so impressed about was the graciousness with which you all treated each other tonight. We don't usually hear that in when there's a when there are differences of opinion. But it was wonderful to hear the that how much you respect each other and how and how and how respectful your conversation was. But I, too, am just sort of confused about the numbers and feel like there's more opposition than the proponents realize. And if that happens, I mean, we're all as council people, we always think we've told everybody, but maybe we haven't told everybody and we always think or maybe we've heard from everybody, but we haven't heard from everybody. And and sometimes these things take a little bit more time. I couldn't agree more that we do need to open up the preservation ordinance. And of course, I did speak with planning last year to ask, you know, let's open this up and take a look, because I do think both sides should have access to the same city resources. The one side shouldn't have more access to city resources about their petition than they than the other one does. So I've tried to put a line of fire under CPD that we get busy on looking at this ordinance and see how we can equalize at least access to resources when these kinds of things happen. But I feel very strongly that a compromise can be worked out too. I feel that way. And if. We go ahead and vote for this historic designation, then there's no there's no ability for compromising. It's a done deal. I think Councilman Herndon might have said that. So I will be opposing this evening as well. Thank you, Dr. Sussman. Councilman Lopez. Thank you. Council President Brooks. First of all, on August one, I've been listening and listening to everybody speaking, and it's hard to tell sometimes. I saw how you've divided yourselves up. Before, I couldn't really tell who which was which. But I do appreciate everybody coming tonight and everybody coming from the north side. This is not the first time that the North Side fills those rooms with. I think the first introduction I had to Late Night Rezonings was a completely different council. As a matter of fact, it was the council that first started on when they were looking at creating my moratorium because the demo permits and the development that was happening right before the the 2010 rezoning. And it was so serious that we stayed here until almost four in the morning. I mean, the 90 speakers that we had tonight was amazing, but it was nothing in comparison to what happened that night. And that was just a few years ago. And it was right before the recession. Then it went right into the recession. And, you know, if you think that we had a problem now, we truly had a problem then. And the decision was to hold off until we had the right district. All the one thing, that's for sure. I mean, maybe I've lived just south of you all my whole life. I know these areas like the back of my hand, and I know that they've. What's that? No, I'm just kidding. I know that they've. They've been faced with a lot of pressure over development. And it's no and I think everybody in this room we could all not our heads and know that this is a huge concern in the north side. It's no surprise. I would wonder where the heck you've been if you didn't agree with that. Everybody knows about it. Therefore, I think it's important that we recognize that there's a lot of different views on just what degree are we comfortable with. So I just want to say that I respect all you all for showing up tonight truly. And I respect the folks that have been organizing for this district as well to. I think it's I think part of the testimony I heard tonight was about gentrification. And, folks, if you look in the eye, I think that that's pretty much a done deal. In the north side, gentrification has already taken place to the point where a lot of the folks that were living in the north side aren't there. And let me just say, as as just a matter of fact, I cannot say that half of the neighborhood opposes the other half is supportive because the neighborhood's not here. There are still a lot of other people that are not here. And for whatever reason, they can't be here until the wee hours. Right. So to be able to be here in the chambers is, is, is. It takes a lot of dedication time. But I know that I know there's a lot of people I know a lot of people that live in this area. And I know they're not here. I don't see them in the pews. So I don't want to count them as a yes or no. I cannot say for certain that half of the neighborhood is opposed or in favor. Values. Somebody talked about neighborhood values. I'm looking at values right here. You're looking at in the high one hundreds and in the millions. And your neighborhood is very popular. As a matter of fact, this whole side of town is popular. It's so popular. I can't even afford to even make a dent on a beard out there. It is. It is so valuable. You have such a precious neighborhood. And it's precious because of that history. It's precious. And it's hard, you know. You. You all are sitting on something that. A lot of folks. Would do anything to live in. Right. And in a lot of ways, that's something that that does have value. And I really doubt and I whoever the realtor is that told somebody this advice that, oh, you know, you're going to have to sell cheap. There is no way in heck anybody selling cheap. And in this part of town, you live next to one of the most beautiful lakes. You live north in the north side. It is beautiful. You have mature trees, you got sidewalks, you got great setbacks. You got brick houses. You're talking to somebody that's in a frame house of cheap stucco. Right. You're talking to somebody who's almost lived their whole lives in a double wide and a crappy duplex. In the West Side. I'd love to have a brick house. And the charm that the north side has. So but what I'm trying to say is that's worth keeping. And however you all continue forward, it's worth keeping. And there are some nice new builds out there. There are. I'm not all opposed to some of the new builds. I think some of it's real classy, doesn't necessarily blend in, but that's just the name. I mean, not every houses is going to look the same or else we'd have Legoland. I really I want to address this now because I want to make this just out right in the future, and it's not the sign of the times . I think it's utterly disgusting when we use Benjamin Stapleton as a historic reference. That's not the kind of history that I want to remember. That's not the kind of history that. Yeah, he may have been mayor. But I cannot tell you. I can't even imagine the kind of people the kind of suffering people had under the KKK in Colorado. I don't want to ever hear folks say, oh, this is we've got to do this because we've got to commemorate is bad enough. We have a neighborhood named after the guy. It's a very dark history and a sad history in Denver, and I hope we don't commemorate it any longer. However, I do think there's value in the history in the history of the neighborhood. Right. And although, yes, we may have to discipline this room and David Broadwell is absolutely right. It is it's it's disappointing people, one side or the other at a rate that they can handle. And I hope folks understand the value that they have in their community that they can handle whatever disappointment that they're going to feel. Right. The other thing I wanted to say is that historic districts should not only be. East of the river. There's so many historic districts throughout Denver. I can't tell you one in my neighborhood. Because it's too late. I can't tell you. About which homes existed in Garden Place and which were original and which weren't because too late. I regard the home as the original Westwood. I can tell you the first few blocks of Barnum because it's too late. Somebody built the duplex on it and crappy at best. That history is important to us as a city. That history has value and it shouldn't just be reserved for neighborhoods east. It should also be. I mean, West Denver and North Denver have a history and a rich history in Denver as well. I think it's important to recognize that. The other thing is that I know my colleague has applied and done different things to try to preserve characters on his own and our characters in our sites full of characters. We'll find that out. No character period on its own. And I've heard folks in the chambers and the diocese and in the community say, well, let them do it. You need to step out in front and try to do this on your own. You all are doing it. He is your city councilman. He is who you elected to represent the district. I don't know. The District like you all do. I don't know the neighborhoods like you all do or the constituents like we all do. And so, you know, I think, you know, I hearing. His testimony also tonight. And when it's this so-called 5050, which I don't really think it's 5050. I think there's a difference that has to be had for that for that leadership in that representation. Also because hearing the testimony that you really don't. I mean. This doesn't prevent you from changing your home. It doesn't prevent you from adding in addition. She just told me the testimony that she doesn't. But you don't. You just have to go through the permitting process like everybody else. There are certain guidelines that you've got to go through. You can put retaining walls up. The Denver Hill is not a historic it's not a means for that and that makes. That makes sense to me. You can still do it. Use. If you had the designation, that can be done. But at the end of the day, the sky is not falling. Your home is a valued home. You live in a valued neighborhood. Excuse me. Excuse me. The other thing I don't like is rudeness. When we're trying to express. Yeah, let's. Let's not engage each other. Let's do it. That's going to lead me to believe. And I'm going to finally cast that. I was so on the fence. I'm going to support this. Thank you. Okay. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to quickly say thank you for sticking out. It's almost 1:00 in the morning. Thank you for being here, taking time to add your voice to this conversation, be. A part of this process. I'm going to say again, because I think it's worth saying in today's day and age. Thank you for the civility that you have shown for each other. And I hope that October 1st over. In your neighborhood is awesome despite all of this. And we need more of that in the world right now. These are these are really hard the growth that Denver. Is facing right now. 40 new people a day. It's really hard. And the issues that come up in this, they're not as. Easy as landmark or not landmark. You know, we just start digging into sustainability. And as a city, when we really get what we're throwing in the landfill, you know, those. It gets into, it gets really complex really quickly. And I won't. Dove off any more than that just to say, you know, what we're all facing as a city across the board are really complex issues and they need productive dialog. And and that doesn't mean that everybody gets to be happy at the end of the day. Right. But that we will be better for the dialog. I really wish that there was a better. Process for us to know who is for and against. I think this has brought into sharp clarity and I know that's not. One of the criteria. But it is something that we consider. And so I'm just throwing out there to my colleagues that I think we need to maybe look at a process on our website for future of these. So that we can have some standardized. Form for people to make their opinions heard. You know, at the end of the day. It's late. All you really care about is, is what? Where am I on this? I'm satisfied that. This district meets the criteria. I have been one of the people pushing against individual. Hostile designation. Of of individual properties and towards. Looking at communities. And neighborhoods. And I think that this does exactly that. And so I appreciate the dialog. I appreciate everyone participating. I will be supporting this tonight. Thank you for coming out and being here. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, president pro tem councilman who? Thank you, Mr. President. I represent District ten, and I have the highest percentage of historic districts in the entire city. I probably got the whole 4%, but, you know, I got such incredible neighborhoods from Cheesman Park, Capitol Hill, Congress for Country Club alum, obviously, and is such a variety. I mean, I got the high end country club that loves their historic district as much as the moderate priced Alamo pursuit of the Mr. Halperin mentioned. You know and I have they all I get is overwhelming support for us and for their district because it protects their character. Their district has a unique, established character and it does deter development that changes character. There's no question in my mind about that. So I really feel also that that it this this application does meet the criteria. And just from my experience with historic districts in my district, I know it'll be successful and I'll be supporting that tonight . Thank you. Thank you. Councilman new Councilwoman Gilmore. And thank you, President Brooks. You know, I have to appreciate all. Of you being here and that really this is a tale of two Danvers sitting here and listening to your testimony and for 5 hours and really hearing the hurt feelings and the pain that was expressed. And at certain points, though, there was laughter and it was light hearted. And so I hope whatever the outcome is by the vote tonight, you hold on to that, because without that, you don't want to live where you don't want to talk to your neighbor next door and you immediately shut your door and you go inside because of something that has happened. And and so. You know, it was painful for me, honestly, sitting here and watching kind of the back and forth. Yeah, I didn't get too bad. But I'm sure the looks and the back and forth, there's some healing that needs to go on. And so I do I hope that October. 1st event is the beginning of a first step for it. But, you know, you shared with us how drastically your neighborhood is changing. And we know that your neighborhood is changing drastically. And I understand your desire to protect your neighborhood. I hope that through a different mechanism, a conservation overlay or some other mechanism, you can protect your neighborhood. Because I also hear the residents who want to have the opportunity to stay in your neighborhood and raise their families, just like I'm sure many of you have already done. And then looking as well at the staff report, you know, really there were five addresses for five individuals. The other two I didn't have an address associated with. So at the end of the day. We're trying to base an entire historic district upon. Five individuals who lived in the District two that may have and then an and. Substantiated number of women who were fabulous, amazing leaders. That's a really hard. I would have loved to had. More. Statistics more data to back up. A yes vote on this designation. The other piece that troubles me is either from CPD's report where 88 residents were non-responsive or from Mr. O'Connell's data that 47 residents were undecided. That's a huge number. That's significant. And Ms.. Let me get her name. Ms.. De Hanes. She was one of the first speakers, and I really thought that we were going to hear a lot from young. Families. Who really wanted to invest in the neighborhood. And I am so grateful that the first person who brought up affordable housing and maintaining a neighborhood that could be inclusive was one of our elders and a senior who has lived in her home for 33 years, and she's 82 years old. I have to think about what's going to happen to the folks who, for whatever reason. Do not have the bandwidth or the time to be here at City Council at 12:51 a.m. to be part of this process. I feel like there's a huge voice that we haven't heard. And I need to honor that voice as well. And so I, based on that, will be voting against it with the sincere hope that you can regroup and come back together and figure out a way forward. Because your community, just all of you being here together, you've got so much to work for. And so I hope that that will be the next steps. Thank you, President Brooks. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I think it's absolutely embarrassing that we don't have an accurate number to the exact address of how many pro's, how many cards and how many didn't respond. For the past few days I've been saying it's a toss up and that's what I believe it is. I think your neighborhood is divided and it's a toss up, but as a city. I'm mortified that that. I just need to challenge the administration to join with council in correcting this. We we passed TIFF after TIFF to a tax increment financing to stimulate a new development. But we don't have a fund of any sort to assist in historic preservation. I mean, we're talking a good game, but I'm not seeing it in ordinance to support the talk. When I walked through this neighborhood and I see some of my tour givers in the audience. Thank you for that. I walked away thinking this is absolutely a neighborhood that deserves to be preserved. It absolutely does. As far as. You know, I see articles getting passed around that historic preservation leads to gentrification. I'm with Brother Lopez. If that's the argument, you want to hang your hat on, Denver's gentrifying. I'm not seeing any evidence that anything that we are doing or can do is going to stop that. Okay. And I'm torn. And for those who have brought up crash on a park, it was 89.4% above 90, what, 95 or what 92? And it was it was a comparatively way more simple situation. There is one form of architecture. With probably 90 some percent undisturbed the current day. So. You know, I'll decide my vote in the next minute and a half. Thank you, Mr. President. You're going to have a little bit more time with that, Councilman Catherine. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. So I live in North and I experience exactly what you all are going through. Every day I get notices on my door and in my mail offering to just take my home as is. Because if they can assemble just a couple of properties, then, you know, it's the next big box coming into my neighborhood, which has changed very, very drastically. I mean, drive through Jefferson Park, there's very little semblance of what used to exist in Jefferson Park. People who come to Denver that haven't been here in a while drive through and say, what happened to the neighborhood? You know, some people think it's good. Others think we need to protect what we have here today. Denver has always been known for our great neighborhoods. But you know what? Today, every neighborhood feels like they're on the chopping block. Right. I mean, across the city as I am around the entire city, this is the one complaint that people are concerned about. When we did Blueprint Denver, it was to look at the edges of neighborhoods. But when we start, you know, getting rezoning applications that come in, that are looking at how how can we, you know, justify a project coming into the fabric of the single family neighborhood? The fact that the edges started to develop are used as justifying circumstances for the next rezone that starts, you know, that domino effect. Now, you know, in your neighborhood where you have our two zoning, that's where you've seen single family homes scrape. It's part of why we don't have affordable housing in this city anymore. And we need to really step up our efforts. You know, $15 million is is a significant contribution. And I want to thank my colleagues, Councilwoman Kenney and Councilman Brooks, for bringing that forward. But it's a drop in the bucket compared to what it cost to build, you know, units and affordability and maintain the diversity that this city has enjoyed for so long. I mean, it's it's disappearing. The entire socioeconomic diversity of this city is is drastically changing. I was involved in the Baker historic district. Directly involved in the lower downtown historic district and the Potter Highlands historic districts. Those neighborhoods all saw significant increases in their property values once those historic districts were in place way before the city started changing and gentrifying many of our our neighborhoods. I think the property value impact is the least of the worries that any of you will have to be concerned about. If this district passes tonight. I think our neighborhoods are worth preserving the beauty of our neighborhoods, the quaint character of them. And it takes a lot of work to bring these applications forward. And, you know, I appreciate all of the communications that I received both for and against. I did take the time to go out and walk and tour the neighborhood. My sister grew up just a couple of blocks south of this area. She was on the south side of 32nd Avenue. So, you know, my adult life, I've been in this part of town and, you know, we're we're seeing it change pretty drastically. And I think if you all really love your neighborhood, this is this is the tool that will make a difference. You know, you can you can wait for a conservation overlay that's going to, you know, put things back, maybe another, you know, eight months or so. You heard Councilwoman Sussman talk about the fact that she's asked CPD to help look at this issue. Well, we still don't have that right. Not just for this neighborhood, but for any of our neighborhoods. And so the reality is. This tool can make a difference today for those of you who are interested in preserving your neighborhood. Does that mean it's going to be a little more challenging to do some things? Yeah, but you know what? If you need to get a permit to do your roof or to add an addition, you still have to go through a city process. It's not like you get to go out and just build whatever you want to build. You have to go through a process. The landmark preservation process is just an additional step that makes sure you're in conformity with what the rest of your neighborhood looks like. You have a quaint and beautiful neighborhood, and I think it's worth preserving. The only last thing I want to say is Councilman Lopez's example of his fence. You know, is is is an example of the steps that we all have to go through when we want to do improvements to our homes. And like I said, this just adds a different a different step to go through. Kara outlined what that entails. And I would just say that for those of you who are. Really in opposition to this. When we had the lower downtown historic district brought forward, we had a two year review every two years for six years. And at the end of six years, it was going to sunset. At the end of the second. Two year review, the entire community came forward unified, saying, please remove the sunset. This is working. We had you know, we had reservations about it, but they were grateful to have that historic district in place. And you see what it is today. Yes. It's one of the most unaffordable neighborhoods in our city. Right. But it it created stability in the downtown area. And it it attracted the investment of so much of what exists there today, including everything else that has happened on the back side, where the train station and all all the rest of that development is. So I will be supporting this tonight. And again, I appreciate the input from everybody. I respect the opinions on all sides. But I think your neighborhoods are worth preserving and I'm going to support it tonight. Thank you. All right. Thanks, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Kennish. Thank you to everyone for a really thoughtful conversation tonight. And as usual, we've tripped beyond the immediate question before as to the bigger issues. And I think my colleagues have identified a number of ways and reasons why we have tradeoffs. When we live in communities. We don't just have private property with pure, unadulterated decision making by the owner, but we have all kinds of tradeoffs that we make. And those tradeoffs aren't just about the person who lives in that particular property. So, for example, no one probably wants to live on a busy street, but if we didn't have some busy streets in Denver and someone didn't live on them, then no one would be able to get to and from work or to and from school or to and from the store. And so there are all kinds of ways where as decision makers in government, we're in the position of thinking about, you know, the the greater good and the entire community. That doesn't mean that it's not really important what the tradeoffs are for the people who are impacted most. However, and so tonight we heard a lot, and I think a lot of my colleagues are giving a lot of weight to these numbers about, you know, how many are in favor and how many are opposed. And I think that I think one of the speakers was correct when they identified that the ordinance isn't neutral in the ordinance, isn't about counting. You know, we often I often get emails from constituents who don't like the idea of government that governs by Paul. Right. And so the question becomes, what's this ordinance about? And this ordinance isn't neutral. It's about what will future generations judge about what we have conserved in the city. And that's a higher accountability. So I have to weigh the impact to folks today with this broader. Mandate, if you will, this broader question. And so when I have residents across the city stopping me in grocery stores and parks and on the street saying, what can we do because we're afraid we're losing something special, this is one of the things we can do. And I have so much respect for my colleagues and their optimism about the fact that there's going to be an easy way. But, you know, I don't know what the outcome the final, final outcome of Park Hill will be, but I will know this, that an overlay district does not prevent demolition. And so I don't know and what will be agreed to. And two, I don't know what will or won't be demolished after that agreement is made. But I think that it may not be that there's an easy way to do this. It may not be that there's an easy way that you can say we're going to preserve important pieces of this city's history and that that's always going to be consensus and that there's always a path for that. I think sometimes there's a hard decision at the end of the roads that we govern on, and I think we're at the end of one of those roads where there is a really hard decision. And so I think many of the things that were said tonight by both sides could be true. At the same time, I think it's true that there's many approvals that folks go through for landmarks that are simple and that are quick. And I think it's also true that there may be some things that aren't going to be possible on people's parcels. Both those things can be true. So if we're not counting votes in terms of saying, you know, that's not what my mandate is, my mandate is to say, does something meet the criteria and does it meet the test of history to say that we've done our best to balance these things? Then the question goes to the criteria, and I do share some of the frustration my colleague, Councilwoman Gilmore, had. The testimony didn't focus quite as much on the criteria as I would have liked it to, but the record is actually much fuller than the testimony we had tonight. And I think it's really important just to identify that there are more criteria than we've talked about from this dais. Right. So retirement properties more than 30 years old, we're talking about an entire historic context. Right. And so that has been really well established. We're talking about the integrity. Right, that has been established. So each of these criteria was touched on, but we kind of got hung up, I think, on the name list. But the historical significance, right, in terms of, you know, not every neighborhood has this history of, you know, the the prominence of the temperance movement and the highlands as the place to escape the sin of the city and then the annexation and the back and forth. A lot of that is covered in the written record that wasn't discussed here as as in as much detail as might have been helpful for some of us architectural significance. Right. I mean, sometimes these things, we can overthink them, right? But it's like if you walk this and you see you can see the Queen Anne's have significance, right? There is something about them that you wouldn't see in any neighborhood across any state, right at any time in history. There was a period whereas I can see a house with siding and, you know, things that may be an architectural style, but it's not going to be. I can't point specifically to one place that it is or one time. And so I think that all of those criteria have been met. And I think that when residents say to me, what is it that we can do to preserve the feel and the nature of this community? This is one of those things, and I think there is adequate community support here for this decision. I have the utmost respect and I don't take I think this is the toughest balance, right, compared to traffic and compared to height and compared to all the other tough tradeoffs. And I voted against the proponents of this application many times and density because I think they were wrong about their ability to stop change, because I think there is a need for density and growth in the city, but not always and not where we have all of these historic criteria that have been met. And so so I think that so with the greatest respect for the gravity of the decision, because that's what it is. And I don't go home sleeping great and easily after these decisions, but I got it. I got to meet the test of the ordinance and I wouldn't be supportive of changing this ordinance to make it neutral because in my view it is about protecting the history that is its goal and that's what it's got to be aimed at. Otherwise it's got no purpose. If it's just to mediate between two parties, we can send you all to mediation. We don't need an ordinance for that. The ordinance is about the history. And so with the criteria being met and weighing all of that, I do need to support this application tonight regardless of how the vote turns out, and I hope the dialog continues about other methods where that's possible. But the protection from demolition is unique here. And I got to weigh that. Thank you. Councilwoman. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. Emblematic, I think of the deep division. In the community. I kept a spreadsheet up here of everybody who spoke. And I just the accident of who left and who didn't get to speak. We ended up with 23 parcels in testifying in favor and two owners of 23 parcels testifying against it. I just want to point that out. So it's evenly split 5050 just because of who stayed and who left, I suppose. I don't share the the level of confidence that Councilwoman each expresses in the in the criteria being met because of some of the things I brought up in questioning about direct association and distinguishing characteristics and significant work of recognized architects and builders, especially when two of the three structures of 173 already are landmarked. And so that does give me pause. I want to recognize the hard work that went into it on on the advocates side. I, too, took the tour that was offered. And it struck me that this is this is a sort of a different kind of district. The last one that we did, in fact, the only one that I was able to vote on in my time here was last year with the South. South Lincoln Street. It's there was a district that was sort of this was uniform characteristic here in in Packard's hill. We have many, many different types. It sort of defies classifying it as queen and or or or any other type of, you know, craftsman or terrorists. And it seems to me very, very different from some of the other districts that I have seen, and especially the last one that we voted on. And so I'm sitting here going back and forth like my friend Councilman Cashman, all through the evening, back and forth, not knowing where where to land on this. But I do have to say, at the end of the day, because of the deep division in the community, I really believe that this needs more consensus. And so I believe I have to oppose this. Thank you. All right. I'm the last speaker. Thank you, guys, for for coming through security, parking your car, refill in your parking meters. If you didn't do it, you've got to take it. We can't take care of it. Sorry. Thank you all for being here. You guys have actually been great. And I will say this is one of the probably one of the most contentious votes that but at the same time, the the the spirit has been jovial. And I think that's going to be important for your neighborhood in the future. I am you know, I don't want to repeat anything. I think the council members in here really embody a lot of what I've been thinking. I'm really frustrated at the. At the number of individuals who are in opposition, not for at you, but, you know, I'd love to see some something much more supportive as as I was talking to, you know, some of the proposers early on, I thought there would be a lot more support. And I don't know what happened. It's not clear to me, you know. QUESTION The council councilperson, who is is the leader in this district, questioned some of the proposers. QUESTION Some of you are it's still not clear to me what would happen. I know that Councilwoman Kenney, which, you know, kind of is saying that, you know, this isn't kind of the most important thing, but it's critical for me. It is critical for me because, you know, one of the reasons I'm such a strong proponent for districts is the evolution of the process that happens in the community process. That's the transformative piece. And I see it happening in my district all the time. And so that's why I'm quite frustrated. I will say this. In 2011. We really wanted to get revitalization going on five points in Walton and in five points in Wellington as a five block area. That is Landmark District. And there was one individual. Me. Who said let's? Let's let's do away with it. Let's deal with the district because no one is going to come and redevelop in five points on Walton. We hadn't had development since the light rail line. It would have been one of the biggest mistakes of. I think my time on city council today, we have over $400 million of redevelopment and it's all in that area of the Landmark District, and it's probably one of the most condensed redevelopment areas except for Brighton Boulevard right now. And when we begin to look at the long term future of historic districts and landmark districts. These are the districts that can protect these incredible economic times when not everybody should be developing. Let's just be honest. And calls that preservation in the community. I see it. I see it every day. I represent the economic engine of the city. And now these districts have not deterred any development at all. Curtis Park. Whelton. All of this is what I represent and I walk in on a daily basis now. Wilson is more commercial, but Curtis Park is mostly residential and really encourage a lot of folks to take a walk through their pop tops. People going in the back, people don't. You guys can't do ads. People don't have to use all of that. With design review. Yes, it is more complex. Yes, it is. Let's not. Talk like it's not, however, at the end of the day. All the residents in my constituency say. Our neighborhood is better for it. And I couldn't get around it. That's what I'm looking at in my support of this. I am struggling big time because of the number of people I see, the number of folks who spoke and articulate it. But at the end of the day, when we look in the future of what we want our city to be, this is the thing that that begins to protect it. So I'll be supporting this. Madam Secretary, Rocco Espinosa. I.

On Monday, October 2nd, 2017, Council will hold a required public hearing on Council Bill 100 for approving a 25 Rahway Urban Redevelopment Plan and authorized and creative creation of the Urban Redevelopment Plan and support the Broadway stations. So you no other business for this body, Senator?","A bill for an ordinance designating the Packard’s Hill Historic District, located generally between Lowell Boulevard on the east, 35th Avenue on the north, the alley between Osceola Street and Perry Street on the west, and 32nd Avenue on the south, as a district for preservation. Approves the designation of Packard’s Hill as a Landmark Historic District for preservation, bounded approximately by Lowell Boulevard & Osceola Street and 32nd Avenue & 35th Avenue in Council District 1. The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 8-22-17.","Based on the transcript, it seems the Denver City Council held a lengthy public hearing on September 25, 2017 to consider designating the Packard Hill neighborhood as a historic district. After hearing testimony from many residents both for and against the proposed historic designation, the Council voted 8-5 to approve establishing the Packard Hill Historic District. 

Some key points:

- There was significant division within the neighborhood, with roughly equal numbers of property owners speaking for and against the historic designation.

- Proponents argued the historic designation would help preserve the architectural character and history of the neighborhood amid development pressures.

- Opponents felt it infringed too much on property rights and ability to modify/expand their homes.

- Council members debated whether there was sufficient consensus in the neighborhood, the criteria for historic significance, potential gentrification impacts, and alternative options like conservation overlays.

- In the end, a narrow majority felt the historic and architectural merits of Packard Hill warranted the protections of a historic district designation under the city's preservation ordinance.

So after hours of public testimony and council deliberations, the Packard Hill Historic District was narrowly approved, reflecting the divisive nature of the issue within that neighborhood.",0.7962962962962962,You are a helpful AI assistant.,Hello!

Declaring that the investigation, arrest and prosecution of anyone engaging in fusion related activities should be among the city of Seattle lowest law enforcement priorities and stating the council's support for full decriminalization of these activities. Thank you so much. I moved to adopt resolution 32021. Is there a second? Second he shoots been moved and seconded to adopt the resolution. Councilmember Lewis, you are the sponsor of this resolution, so I'm going to hand it over to you to address it. I do understand that you have a substitute version of of this amendment. So if you'd like to move the substitute version so that we're having a conversation about the substitutes, that would be the first step that you would need to do is make that motion. Thank you, Madam President. I move to amend resolution 32021 by substituting version two, a four version 1/2. In moved and seconded to substitute the resolution as reflected in version two, a hand back over to Councilmember Lewis to walk us through the substitute. Thank you, Madam President. The substitute. I just just flagged everybody. There's not really any substantive changes. It just reflects feedback in terms of some of the wording around the Office of Intergovernmental Relations interaction with this policy, based on feedback from the department at the time of initial introduction, it did not reflect the nuance of how OCR would prefer their advocacy at the state level to be framed. Specifically, the original resolution instructed them to, you know, to write legislation. We have other partners who will write the legislation. We will more be in a position of supporting it. That level of detail mattered a great deal to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations, rightly so. So that is the only significant change. Otherwise, it generally reflects the substance of version one. And Madam President, I don't know if you are we going to vote on the adoption now and then I'll I'll speak to the resolution more broadly after that. Yeah. So we'll we'll vote on the on the substitute version first and then I'll hand it back over to you to make comments about the, the, the resolution generally. Are there any additional comments on the substitute version? I just want to say thanks, Counselor Lewis, for being responsive to our request to talk to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations to make sure that their concerns were addressed. Really appreciate your quick work on that and your willingness to engage with them. So thanks for that. I don't see any other hands raised about the substitute. So will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of the substitute? HERBOLD Yes. Suarez I. Lewis Yes. Morales Yes. Macheda. I. Peterson I so want. Yes. Strauss. Yes. President Gonzalez. I nine in favor none opposed the motion carries and the substitute is now adopted. I'll hand it back over to Councilmember Lewis to address the amended resolution. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate the opportunity to take this first legislative step as a body in what has been a fairly long process of engagement on this. Certainly something we can't be accused of rushing, much to the consternation of some of our stakeholders on this. But I do think that the result has been a really good, deep dove into the nuances of the policy around these substances and the current policy of our local prosecuting attorneys, as well as the Seattle Police Department. I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for her leadership as chair of the underlying committee throughout this process, which began in earnest in the spring with our discussions with folks over at Deep Nature Seattle, and then became more formalized with a letter written by this Council in June to urge the Overdose and Recovery Innovation Task Force to study this issue throughout the summer and then promulgate back to US recommendations. We did receive those recommendations in August, as the Council may recall, to adopt a resolution or an ordinance or some other representation of city policy to emphasize to the extent of our power as a municipality that law enforcement around antigens is the lowest priority for the use of municipal officials to to enforce the law in regards to those substances. And this resolution before us today is a way for us to go on the record in support of these policy goals before our budget process really gets rolling and before the state legislature convenes in January to holistically consider drug policy as the ongoing conversation post the Supreme Court's decision. The policy in front of us is limited to natural substances. Most famously, throughout this process, psilocybin and ayahuasca have been the most cited of these natural psychedelics. It is not inclusive of synthetic psychedelics that are manufactured. An example of that would be LSD. This has been a really interesting process to really learn more about these substances and things that I did not know until meeting with Discriminator Seattle and really to keep diving into this. Obviously, this is part of a broader policy conversation nationally and following on the heels of similar resolutions that have been passed in cities like Denver, Colorado , Washington, D.C., Oakland, California, among other jurisdictions. And then, of course, wholesale state law changes in Oregon just to the south of here that passed with a convincing margin in recent elections. I you know. I just want to note a little bit for the viewing public, just some of the things that have really driven me to to take a keen interest in this and how I think this resolution really sets the stage as the first significant action in the state of Washington to move this policy forward, affirmed by any government, local or state or county. And that's to to really state that these non-addictive natural substances have real potential in clinical and therapeutic settings to make a really significant difference in people's lives. And this is really the thing that personally, through the process motivated me was meeting with constituents and people who have had experiences with these substances that have really materially helped them overcome addiction and helped them overcome severe depression or other behavioral mental health conditions that have really made a difference in their lives to the point where they don't know, don't know where they would have been without the access to treatments or therapies connected to some of these substances. I. Given that Seattle is also host to one of the world's premier medical research universities at the University of Washington. And given the strong support throughout this process from many of the clinical faculty at the University of Washington in psychiatry and behavioral, mental health and medical research, it has just made it really evident that Seattle really could be a place where in the long term, we really are. For innovation around what possibility these substances could produce in terms of our ongoing struggle as a civilization of people against a lot of these really debilitating conditions. I do want to briefly address at the end of my remarks here and we heard a little bit in the public comment of the discussion around peyote. And I do want to want to just address it briefly that this resolution is not as currently worded, inclusive of peyote. Our local chapter of decriminalize nature did not want to include it because there is, as we heard, disagreement over the inclusion of the substance. And, you know, I want to thank the national chapter of Decriminalize Nature for their letter that was distributed to this council last week advocating for the inclusion of peyote. And there's no doubt or disagreement that priorities of sacred resource to the indigenous people of the southwestern United States who lived in good relation with peyote 2000 years. But because there is disagreement among the best method to reverse the century long decline in peyote and the the appropriate use of it, and whether increased access or isolation is the best approach for now. In this resolution, myself and the stakeholders at Durham Nature, our local chapter of Bikram Nature, have decided to keep peyote out of it . However, for forthcoming any potential forthcoming council actions, for example, if some of this were at some point manifested into a formal ordinance for a policy with more permanency, I think it's certainly a conversation I'm willing to continue to have as someone leading on these issues of the Council, because it does have to be crafted with very careful consideration for its impact and the need to be sensitive on the decisions around the policy related to purity. So I did just want to make those comments that we you know, we're certainly sensitive and look forward to continuing to to look into it. But this current resolution does not does not touch on it. So with that, I don't have any additional comments, Madam President, and certainly I'm excited to get this over the line and do it before we budget takes up more of my life. So thank you. Thank you so much. Appreciate those remarks. Are there any additional comments on the resolution? Councilmember. So one piece. Thank you. I am, of course, voting yes on this resolution. My office has been from the from the very first moment we heard from the activists and decriminalize nature. And many of the clinical and medical experts actually saw some of the most prominent ones who actually, incidentally, reside in District three. Since that very moment, my office has been in strong support of decriminalizing psychedelics. Some the research seems just absolutely overwhelming, as the public comment today has justified, too. And I also appreciate specifically the individuals who testified from personal experience. I really appreciate that. However, as I mentioned in council briefing last week, I am a little confused by this resolution because it is a resolution and not an ordinance and why this resolution is being passed. When there is an ordinance from my office and it has been available for months. The resolution asks the police to, quote unquote, codify policies to effectively decriminalize psychedelic drugs. But we know resolutions can only make requests. Of course, my office strongly supports resolution. In fact, we have advocated for and won resolutions in the past, but we have not pushed for resolutions in place of ordinances when it is possible and realistic and necessary from a political and moral standpoint for the Council to have an ordinance passed to decriminalize psychedelics. In fact, in fact, rather than just in rhetoric, would require an ordinance. And it is the city council, not the police department, that has the authority to pass such an ordinance. Council members will remember that on June 29th, three months ago, my office sent for introduction of Council Bill. That would have done just that. And just in response to some of the public comment today on an issue that has not been resolved. I if you are listening, I really welcome activists from the whole spectrum of viewpoints on the question of peyote to discuss with my office so that we can understand if there are any amendments to be made to the ordinance that we have put forward. And I would really like to learn more about that issue, and I certainly appreciate those who spoke in public comment about it. The bill from my office was transmitted to Councilmember Herbold, who is the chair of the Public Safety Committee. Unfortunately, the bill has languished on the chair's desk for the last three months, and the council has not. I mean, today in the Commons so far that ordinance has not even been acknowledged, its existence has not been acknowledged. And I think that the only things I've heard from council members as well, you know, some things were not resolved. Well, let's resolve those things. Why would we do a resolution? Let's do an ordinance. And I just don't I fail to see what the plausible reasons are for councilmembers who claim to support this issue. You led an ordinance which takes concrete action, sit in the cities, computers on interviews, and instead push a resolution which only has the power to make a request. And as I said, I be voting yes on this resolution. And I'm really grateful to all the activists are really urge you all to keep mobilizing and organizing for this. But please understand that we will need an ordinance to be passed by this Council for for real action, to be taken for actual changes to be seen in the city of Seattle on the issue of psychedelics and decriminalizing psychedelics. And I would urge all councilmembers who say they support the issue to co-sponsor the ordinance with me. And let's discuss if there are any amendments that needed to be made based on local and national activists input on various issues like. Thank you so much, Bobo, please. Thank you. So I appreciate the councilmember silent has introduced or I don't actually think it's been referred to my committee, and I think we held it and did not refer it yet. So I don't think it's true that it's been languishing on my desk. But nevertheless, after some discussion about whether or not the bill should be referred to my committee, we agreed as a council that we were going to hold taking any action until we received recommendations from the Overdose Emergency Innovative Recovery Task Force. Partially, this is because we're aware that there are going to be efforts in the wake of the decision and in the wake of legislation that was passed last session to respond to the Blake decision, there's going to be, I think, a really robust discussion at the state level about enforcement of not just Athena Jones, but enforcement around possession of of other drugs that are that are possessed for for personal use. So I think we're trying to be really sensitive to those discussions that are about to occur on a statewide level. And that's why we asked the task force to give us recommendations, because, again, this task force is not going to be just working on the issue around psychedelics. They're going to be working on this broader issue of of enforcement of drug laws that are that are impacting communities with disparate impacts across across the spectrum of drug law enforcement and have, you know, for for decades, for generations. And so the recommendation that we received from Task Force was specifically that municipalities in the state of Washington and elsewhere that have independent ordinance criminalizing psychedelics repeal them and those that don't should direct their law enforcement agencies, local prosecutors and municipal courts to prioritize enforcement and should publicly communicate this as municipal policy. When I reached out to the police department to make a determination of whether or not we needed to communicate this lowest law enforcement priority to the police department. Based on my understanding of the police department's communication due out, the department is not only is it not the lowest law enforcement policy, but that officers have been instructed to no longer detain nor arrest individuals under our CW 6950 413 alone, and officers will no longer confiscate drugs from an individual based only on a violation of our CW. 69504013. Now we know that policy might change. This is the existing policy of the Seattle Police Department. We as a city council are expressing our support for this continued policy, and I recognize that at a later date, depending on what happens at the state legislature, what happens with under the leadership of of a new mayor or a new police chief or a new city attorney, that we may need to look at a different legislative action than what we're taking today. But I'm very appreciative of Councilmember Lewis and bringing this resolution forward. You can't remember horrible things first a lot. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, just for the record, I'm I'm just quite surprised by kind of the more horrible response on the question of the process or the ordinance from my office. The bill has indeed been on our Consumer Herbals desk as chair of the Public Safety Committee for three months until timber might remember and other councilmembers might remember the discussion we had going down to a briefing three months ago. And I pointed out that that rodent on my office had called her office 23 times about it, asking their office to collect the one button story, which is the city's legislation management software to allow the bill to be introduced, the ordinance to be introduced, though none of those calls were returned and all of this discussion happened in public. But it seems from what Councilmember Horrible said at the beginning of our honor just now, it was implied that there was somehow an agreement among the council that the bill should not be introduced. But that's not true. There was no vote. I have not certainly not agreed. I want the bill to be introduced, debated, discussed and voted on as soon as possible. I'm not complaining about all of this in in in any at any great length, because I was hoping that council would bring an ordinance if they because, you know , I've seen this many times when my office brings an ordinance and the Democrats will bring their own ordinance, fine. You know, for us, the issue is more important, not whose name is in the city's registration legislation management software. But but it is a tangible failure at this point to bring forward an ordinance regardless of whose name is on it. And that is why we need to raise this issue, because that that is not how it happened. What happened was that we, my staff and I followed up assiduously wanting the ordinance to move forward. But, you know, it's often these kinds of sort of bureaucratic channels are used to block it. And that's why that's that's your that's your decision. But let's be open about it. Thank you. And I hope that there is an ordinance moving forward. And I again, I restate my invitation to council members to add their name to the ordinance. And let's discuss whatever remaining outstanding issues that are and let's pass the ordinance. Thank you. Thank you. Customer Support. Your objection is noted. For the record, I would like for us to refocus our comments and debate on the resolution that is before us, as opposed to a ordinance that is not before us at the time. So if we could recommit to just focusing our comments in on the amended resolution that is before us, I appreciate it. Again, I appreciate that Councilmember Salant has expressed concerns about about a resolution passed over an ordinance. It is noted. Let's let's go ahead and and finish up our our debate on the resolution. I am going to give Councilmember Lewis the last word before he has the last word. I see that Councilmember Mosquito has your hand raised. So I would like to close out debate after Councilman Mosquito's remarks. Thank you, council president. Your comments and direction is exactly the type of comments I was hoping to make today. I did want to center our conversation back on the recommendations that come directly from community or from the task force that has been working with folks who have been researching these issues, who have been exploring the possibility of the benefits of these substances, and wanting to make sure that we have an understanding of why. To me, this really comes down to a public health approach to helping those who may see some benefits of having some of these substances be available to them to treat things that are so near and dear to my heart. As many folks know, my sister suffers with multiple sclerosis. And in terms of trying to find opportunities to address the inflammation and the trauma that her brain and her body go through, I'm excited for any opportunity that allows for her to have a healthy and safe life and to experience joy and and not only for her mind , but for her body as well. I see that there's a lot of possibilities from the conversations that we've had with folks about those who have experienced traumatic brain injury injuries and folks who are dealing with immuno compromised systems, folks who have been suffering from PTSD, people who also have depression and anxiety, any opportunity that we can, especially in the wake of COVID, to help find solutions for folks in a safe way, in a way that helps people access safe substances, is something that I'm going to support from a public health perspective and appreciate the incredible amount of research that has gone into this from those who have been supporting this type of research and advocacy for years. And again, just one additional way for us to relieve stress and anxiety. And the physical and emotional symptoms of some of these complications within our mind and body. I'm going to be supporting this resolution and look forward to future work with all of you to see how we can advance these commitments today. So thanks again to the community for making this possible and centering us back on those who are potentially going to benefit from access access through this public health name. Makes me excited about the opportunities in the future. Councilmember Mosqueda. Councilmember Lewis, any closing remarks? Thank you. Madam President, I actually don't have anything else to add.

- Councilmember Lewis cited the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics, based on input from medical experts and those helped by these substances for addiction, depression and mental health issues.

- The resolution supports advocacy for statewide decriminalization of natural psychedelics but does not cover synthetic psychedelics like LSD or the substance peyote due to disagreement around its inclusion. 

- Councilmember Sawant criticized passing just a resolution rather than an ordinance her office previously introduced to decriminalize psychedelics, which she felt would enact more concrete changes.

- Other councilmembers explained wanting to await task force recommendations and sensitivity around pending statewide drug policy changes before potentially pursuing an ordinance.

Robert Bob Foxy, Joanne Medina, Mary Valdez and Louis B Hill for their devotion to the arts community in Denver. And that the clerk and recorder of the city and county of Denver shall affix the seal of the city to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to Denver arts and venues. Thank you, Councilwoman Torres. Your motion to adopt. I move that proclamation. 20 dash 900 be adopted. Second. Second. All right. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of council. Councilwoman Torres. Thank you, Madam President. This is. A division that's so near. And dear to my heart because of my own personal love for arts and music and theater in Denver. And the work that they do really creates and enriches the cultural vein throughout our city. So I really do want to thank all of these individuals for their many, many years of service to Denver. I do want to in particular call out Mary Valdez and would. Refer. Folks who are unfamiliar with her work and her. Impact. To District three to West Denver or to a lot of neighborhoods, to the article that was done about her titled How one Woman Helped Commissioned 300 Murals in Denver. And the first paragraph of that I'll read in 2018, the Denver Public Art Program increased its collection by nearly 30%, commissioning over 60 murals through the Urban Arts Fund . The total amount of murals in the collection now totals at just over 300. Although this is a monumental task that sounds like it required a full staff to accomplish. It was all coordinated and curated by one woman, Mary Valdez. Valdez works under worked under the Denver Arts and Venues Division of the Denver Public Art Program and started commissioning murals via the UAF in 2009. In the decades since, Valdez's reputation in the street art community in Denver has blossomed because she curates the city's walls like a gallerist. I just wanted to thank in particular Mary for supporting our local artists in West Denver and throughout the city and really elevating the art that paints our entire city. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you. Councilwoman Torres, I want to echo your comments about Maribel Diaz and her contributions. I had the honor of working with her on the selection committee when the better Denver bond issue finally got around to the Hadley Library renovations that were just recently done about a year and a half ago. And she just shepherded that process so eloquently and so inclusively. And and we came up with that with a very, very fitting artwork that's going to go in there. But I was really impressed with how she handled that. And I believe that, as you said, I think we will miss her and I look forward to seeing that maybe she mentors someone to take over and and proceed as efficiently and as inclusively as she did. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. And I'll go ahead and chime in. I believe Mary Valdez has replicated herself numerous times because it would never fail, that we would start talking about wanting to do a piece of art. And I would see her somewhere and she'd say, You know what? I've got this great community artist. And it was just like she was everywhere listening to those requests throughout the city. And so we're going to miss those dedicated arts venues, employees. And Mary definitely has a special place in our heart. And so congratulations on that retirement, Madam Secretary, roll call. Me. Got you. Torres, I. Black. I see tobacco. I. Clark. I. Flynn. I. Herndon I times. I. Can reach. I. Ortega by Sandoval. I swear. I. Madam President. I. Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the results. For Vice. 12 Eyes Proclamation 900 has been adopted. We have 5 minutes for the proclamation acceptance. Councilman Torres. And we can start the timer. Would you please introduce whoever you like to accept this proclamation? Thank you, Madam President. I'd like to ask Maria Valdes. I think she's in on the panel if she wouldn't mind muting and saying some comments on behalf of herself and. Her fellow arts and venues employees. Hello. Everyone. Good afternoon. This is Maribel since. Well, I'm really honored, I got to say, first and foremost for. Forgive me for mentioning Mead the way she did this. Jamie knows. I don't know. Being a Latina woman, born and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico, coming to Denver from a large family of ten, you know, the what has always been something that was very important and sacred to a lot of Hispanic families. And it still is. I had the honor of working in that community for many, many years through the corridor of Mawson Road, several public art projects along Federal Boulevard with some various artists. And then to top it off, in December of 2019, working with Haim Molina for the incredible totem pole on Federal and Near Sixth Avenue is just fantastic. It was a dream come true to manage that project, and I just got to do a shout out to Jaime Torres because she was so excited for the project and I was so supportive with our team. It was on location for the installation. You know, my time has come short. I was hoping to stay out of your ears, but with the city, it is time for me to say, See you soon. Not goodbye. I wait. I will stay. The art scene, working with private artists and also showcasing my own personal art, which I'm really excited about. But I've got to say, you know, with the 20 years with the city of Denver, I choose people. And I said, you know, I feel like I grew up. It takes a village to raise this kind of kid. And so after 20 years, I just felt like, you know, I was a young mother of two. And being a grandmother of three darling little girls in the experience with the city of Denver has been phenomenal. I've had. Sisters who have worked with the. City also were just they love their experience being a part of Denver's public art program for 18 years. It's been a dream come true job. I've loved every ounce of it I've grown and I've developed my skills with, you know, working in the leadership of, you know, under Michael Chavis and Tyrion and obviously others and Ginger White and all my colleagues. Root, Rudy Cherry, Brendan Picker, I could just go on and on are just amazing people, amazing people and so, so passionate about what we do. The arts. Is so vital. It's like eating and breathing. In my opinion, we need a daily now. During COVID, we see how important the arts are and how. We. Need to just really survive. To be creative, to be prosperous and to. You know, create lives. But I can go on and on. But thank you, Jamie, so much from the bottom of my heart. I adore you. I look forward to working on some other projects because we will. We're not done yet. Even though I'm not city employee. I am a freelance art advocate and you will hear from me and we will have our coffee and our lunches and we will spearhead what we need to do in Denver and abroad. So thank you so much for for this opportunity and allowing me to share a few words. I appreciate it. Overall in that round of applause for our retirees. And so thank you, Mary Ann, and the other folks that were honored tonight for this and and wonderful retirement. That's exciting for you.

Thank you to the Clerk. This Council bill will require five votes in the affirmative in order for it to pass. What I'm going to do is I'm going to move to pass the council bill. Then I'm going to ask for a second. And once that second has been made, we do have council central staff on the line available for questions. I will go ahead and suspend the rules to allow for questions to be directed to council central staff if any of the council members have it, or if the sponsor, which is council member Tammy Morales, wants to provide council central staff with an opportunity to speak to the bill as well. So I'm going to go ahead and do both of those motions. I'm going to then allow Councilmember Morales to address the bill, and then we will go ahead and take a vote on any amendments and the substantive bill. So I'm going to move to pass Council Bill 119757. Second. Second. It's been moved and Sanjay intends to pass the bill. Again, council members, please note that Yolanda HOA, Amy Gore and Ali Bonacci of Council Central staff have joined this meeting. Should you have any questions? I will move to suspend the rules if there are any questions for central staff after the prime sponsor speaks to the bill. Councilmember Morales, would you like to address this bill? Yes, thank you. Council President Gonzalez, welcome back. Thank you. If I might take just a moment, I do want to acknowledge that the staff at the Office of Economic Development have been working tirelessly, as have all of our first line frontline folks who work for the city. So I do want to acknowledge the hard work that they are putting in to help us as we get sometimes , you know, hourly new information about this crisis. You know, our OPD staff are hearing from small businesses who are worried about their employees, worried about their own businesses, and they are dealing themselves now with some of the secondary trauma from hearing those stories over and over again. So I want to I want to thank our city employees who are helping us navigate through what is a really unprecedented time. And I want to thank the mayor and Director Lee for getting this bill to us quickly. This is an expansion of the existing business stabilization fund that we have at the Office of Economic Development. It is shifting about $1.4 million in community development block grant funds to provide emergency working capital grants to small businesses, really to micro-businesses who have five or fewer employees, because these funds are HUD funds. They require that the household income of the recipients be below 80% of area median income. So that's just a little bit of context for who will be receiving these grants. And they are roughly about, you know, up to $10,000 to provide some sort of relief for for working capital and being able to to pay employees or pay rent or. Manage as best I can. Great. Thank you. Councilmember Morales. Anything else you'd like to add before I go to the next step? No, I don't think so. Okay. Thank you so much. If there is no objection, the council rules will be suspended to have central staff address the council. Hearing. No objection. The rules are suspended. I wanted to open up the line really quickly just to provide counsel, central staff, an opportunity to add anything to the remarks that have already been made by Councilmember Morales as relates to Council Bill 119757. I will hand it over to Yolanda, Amy and Allie in the event that there is anything else that you want to add. And if there isn't, just indicate so. Hi. This is Yolanda. So you want to cancel central staff? Um, I would just add that, um, the appropriations from the Human Services Department, um, are to do a there are a couple of sources from the Human Services Department which, um, any could speak to in more detail. Um, and I can also speak to some of the discussions we've had with the Office of Economic Development in terms of how they are, how they are planning to distribute these funds. Because there is, um, as Councilmember Morales has noted, extremely high demand for these. And so, um, there are and so the Office of Economic Development has been accepting thousands of applications at this point and is screening them right now and is closing the application window next Wednesday. So please let everyone know. And they are also conducting outreach to ensure that everyone has a chance to apply. And they have noted that their intention is to prioritize, uh, businesses and these small micro-enterprises, as they call them, in neighborhoods at high risk of displacement. And so there, there will be a process by which they will select those who are eligible and, um, and kind of weighted towards those businesses in those locations. Thank you, Liza. Amy, is there anything you'd like to add? No, I don't have anything to add, but I'm happy to answer any questions that councilmembers have. Great. Thank you, Ali. Anything you'd like to add before I go through the process of asking if there are questions? No, I don't have anything to add. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'm going to go ahead. And just to avoid the that the casualty of conference calls, that is the cattle call. The question I'm going to actually call each of your names by order of districts. And if you have questions, please pose your questions at the time that I call your name. And if you don't have a question, just so you don't have any questions, but I'm going to go through the list kind of in a roll call fashion to try to keep this orderly. So I'm going to start with Councilmember Herbold. Do you have any questions for council central staff or the prime sponsor? I would love it if the council said to staff or the viewing public and the press who might be reporting on this can just very quickly go through what the source, what the this is. These are CDBG funds, their CDBG funds that were program for another purpose. If we could just go quickly through what those purposes were and how the departments are going to accommodate. Whether or not it's. There's no need for those for those purposes as originally anticipated or there's another source. Thank you, Councilmember Humble. This is a of council central staff to answer that question. Approximately $400,000 of the funds in this council bill are from HST for 2019 underspend of program administration funds. An additional 1 million of the funds that are being transferred by this council bill are from the Human Human Services Department's Community Facilities Program. And the intention of that funding was for Community Care Facility for Seniors as part of the North Lot Project at the Park Med Center in Beacon Hill. And what we have heard is that the project isn't quite ready to use those funds in 2020 and is okay with us using those funds for a different purpose, and that we believe that in 2021 and 2022 or in 2022, we will have other CDBG funds that we can devote to that project in a more useful time to the project. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Amy, for that explanation. Councilmember, did that answer your question? It absolutely did. Thank you. Okay. Do you have any other questions for council central staff for the prime sponsor? I do not. Great cabinet move to Councilmember Morales. I know that you are the prime sponsor, but in the event that you have additional questions that you'd like council central staff to run through, I'd offer you the opportunity to do that now. And if you don't, just let me know that you don't. Well, I do have one question. Yolanda was looking at that. My understanding is that the intent is to use kind of a lottery system for awarding, because we have so many people, so many small businesses who have applied. I wonder if there's any additional information about how that process will work. So I can tell you that the the lottery is going to be a weighted lottery system so that, um, the Office of Economic Development has stated that they are target and their goal is to that 80% of these awards go to those neighborhoods that are at highest risk of just businesses in neighborhoods that are at highest risk of displacement. Thank you. Yolanda, any follow up questions to that? Councilman Morales. I'm good. Thank you. Great. Okay. We're going to move on to council members want. Do you have any questions for council central staff or the prime sponsor? I don't. Thank you so much. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Any questions for council central staff or the prime sponsor or just comments in general? No, thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Suarez, any questions or comments for council central staff or the prime sponsor? Nope. All right. Thank you. And Councilmember Strauss. Same. Any questions or comments for council central staff or the prime sponsor? Not at this time. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Lewis. Any questions for council central staff or the prime sponsor? Not currently. Thank you. Thank you. And Councilmember Mosqueda. Any questions for Council Central's staff or the prime sponsor? No, I'm good. Thank you. Great. Thank you so much. To cancel central staff for that description of the bill and for the follow up answers to some of the questions. And thank you to Councilman Morales for your attention to this detail. I know that economic developments, particularly protection of small businesses in our community, are very important to you and that you have continue to prioritize those issues. And this is certainly an important moment to continue doing that work. I also understand that you have an amendment to the bill, so we will go ahead and consider your amendment first and then we will go ahead and vote on the underlying bill if and once it is amended. So I will open up the floor to you, Councilman Morales, to make your motion to amend the bill. So thank you. So as as Yolanda said, we do have lots of businesses who are very worried about how they're going to survive this crisis. And this is going to be an important fund to help mitigate for a couple of hundred businesses. So I understand that we need to move quickly. And I worry that in our case to react to the crisis that we might set in motion some systems that will perpetuate some of the inequities in our city. So I just want to make sure that we have an equitable process for awarding these funds and any other funds that we make available to Seattle in response to this crisis. So we have, I think, about 36,000 small businesses in Seattle. Thousands of them are owned by people who don't speak English. Applications for this fund were available online, but only in English for the first couple of days. So if you speak English, you can fill out the application online and hit send. But it was a couple of days before they were made available in other languages and the online application had to be printed out and mailed in or handed over to to an outreach worker. So, you know, when we're when those who don't speak English have extra barriers put in place in order to participate, we know that we've got some some issues. And I know that there wasn't any mal intent here. What we have instead is a small example of how, you know, very often our city government operates with blinders on to anyone who isn't part of the dominant culture. And we really have to change the way our city functions so that everyone has access to these resources. So rather than slow down the disbursement of this particular fund, I'm asking that we hear back from OED this summer about how the funds were distributed. You know, how many applicants did we get from people who don't speak English? How many folks were awarded who don't speak English? And just making sure that, you know, non-English speakers also get access to these opportunities. So if we're going to live up to our recent social justice goals, we really have to be thoughtful about infusing these principles into every aspect of our work, and especially as we create these emergency responses to the COVID 19 crisis. I think it's really incumbent upon us to make sure that we aren't perpetuating these systems of inequity, even if it means that we slow down our response a little bit. We really need to make sure that people of color, low income folks, limited English speakers have access to the information they need so that they can receive emergency relief, too. And so that is the spirit in which this amendment is offered. It is not a requirement that we provide this report. It is merely a request that we hear back from them about how this money was distributed. Thank you for that description of the amendment. Councilman Morales, I still need you to move the amendment. I move that we adopt Amendment one. Great. So there has been a motion made and it's been seconded. So Councilman Morales is already, as the sponsor of this amendment, has already spoken to it.

Agenda item one accessible 119 451 really into land use and zoning w a moratorium on the filing, accepting acceptance, processing and or approval of applications for development in areas currently used as mobile home parks, declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date all by three fourths vote of the City Council . And I apologize. I was not clear on my order of the agenda. Councilmember Swan, you have the floor. Thank you, Bruno. And and let me just say, I don't blame you all for not knowing that there was not the legislation because this is parliamentary procedure. Why would you know it unless you absolutely have to? And even then, it can be very confusing. Thank you. So everybody who's been paying attention to the question of the al-Shabaab mobile home crisis knows what this is about. But I just want to do share to do a three quick stories of what we've heard from our community members at Halcyon. And one of them is Renny Hagan, who's a retired bartender and member of Unite Here, a local aid, who told us about being homeless for years, having lived in a tool shed with no heat or electricity or running water before finding a home at Halcyon, where she now tends a garden and grows vegetables for her neighbors. She told us she would likely be homeless again if the developers succeeded in evicting the mobile home owners. And she says, for seven years I've had the security without worry, and now they're going to take it away. Eloise MIKKELSON, whom you heard from just now, is the retired machinist and member of the Machinists Union, is a painter , musician and grandmother who has lived at Halcyon for 16 years. She says this is a caring community. We look out for one another. Some of us really would have no other place to go. You heard from Wesley Shearer, a former Teamster, who is raising a granddaughter who has special needs. Halcyon is a neighborhood where Wesley and his family feel safety and trust, he says. Help save our community because that's all we have. We know that what happened, as the committee members have said, was this property went on the market for $22 million. Garland based corporate developer named Blue Fawn filed pre-application. The residents have known about this because they got letters in the mail and they got organized. They got they contacted my office and we had an incredibly moving committee meeting on Friday, January 18th, where we had all these testimony and well, not only the residents, but so many of their supporters, some of whom we spoke to, they demanded that council take action. As it was said earlier, this demonstrates what you can accomplish by building a movement. And when that movement has its own voice in City Hall, this is what you can accomplish. You can actually win victories. And let me just say also, it is nice that Yudof is now saying that they will ask you as bank to sell the property to someone who wants to rent it, run it as a mobile home park. But the residents of Halcyon, as those of us who have fought for housing justice for years, no talk is cheap. The residents were promised that their homes wouldn't be saved in the past, but then they were surprised by a notice on their doors last fall, saying that the park was being sold. So we know that we know not to trust empty words. We know we have to continue fighting right the way. And we also know that because of our activism, Blue Farm, that developer has backed off for now. But we know better than to take promises and intentions at face value when a 22 million property sale is on the line. So if you have intent to keep this property as a mobile home park, then they will have no problem with council passing legislation for flowing from this moratorium to designate this region, this property with the manufactured home park designation. And as we've said before, Seattle will not be the first city doing this. The city of Portland has already done that. The Portland City Council unanimously voted last summer to do have a manufactured home mobile home park designation. They are mobile home park communities because there was a widespread demand from from ordinary people. Let's preserve for existing affordable housing. I want to do first of all, I want are a lot of people talking, but I wanted to first of all, congratulate the residents of Halcyon themselves. Can you please give yourself a big hand? And look at this Seattle Times cover page. This. This my dear friend and fellow activist. This is a testimonial to the kind of power you can build. When we get organized collectively and this has happened because we did that not because any one person championed your cause, but you do need your own voice. As at City Hall, as Linda Chase in the article says, there are million there are a million sites where developers can build. There are only two mobile home parks in the city. This is housing for people who don't have a lot of money. This is working class housing. Let's preserve it. And as HBO, they can said in the article, it shouldn't take a crisis for you to do something. It shouldn't take people with gray hair crying on your shoulders while these people with gray hair are done crying. They are now fighting. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien, for agreeing to co-sponsor the legislation. Thanks. Thanks also to Kendall Freeman and Denver Doan, who did a lot of the work on this and also getting arrested as usual, the council's central staff director. Special thanks to Nick Jones from my office, who spent a lot of time with you all. He's right there. And Jonathan Rosenblum and Saja Soma. And I wanted to join the others who have already said in thanking Unite here. Local eight OPIO Local eight. I am Local 751. The Puget Sound Advocate for Retirement Action, the Vietnamese Seniors Association, Trinity Methodist Church, the Faith Action Network. Reverend Angela Yang of the Bethany United Church of Christ. So many spoke in support of the preservation of this affordable housing. I really thank everybody. I also want her to know that not Paul Bergman is your long time member of the labor movement who's been here at every meeting with you all. You have a lot of support, but let's not stop here. Let's win this moratorium and let's make sure we keep fighting. I do have some closing remarks at the end before we take the vote. Very good. Thank you, guys, from Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. Councilmember Swan, thank you so much for your leadership on this. But I really want to give so much credit to the residents of Halcyon for your work to make this possible. In addition to everything that Councilmember Simon said, we have a lot of work to do to protect the remaining two mobile home or manufactured home parks in Seattle. And we have a lot of work to do to ensure that we have enough affordable housing for everyone in our city who needs it. And one of the things that you reminded us all again in your testimony today and last week was this is not just about housing. This is not just about a roof in a wall, but it's about community. And the power of your community has really showed up in amazing ways. And as we continue to build more and more affordable housing, we need to make sure that we're also creating spaces where communities, powerful communities like yours can form, because that's what we need in our city. So thanks for your leadership and work. Unless you're any other comments on the base legislation. I believe Councilmember Johnson has an amendment and we could come back to the base legislation for comments as well. So, Councilmember Johnson, you'd like to describe your amendment. Thanks. Appreciate that. Council president. As my colleague saw this morning, and for the benefit of the public who've heard this a couple of times, I'll just repeated the amendment that I'm bringing forward this afternoon would make a change to the fifth section of this bill, and it would insert two key concepts. The first concept is that a set of recommendations will be developed by the Office of Planning and Community Development and the Department of Construction and Inspections about what a set of long term proposals could look like for something beyond the moratorium that is being proposed today. And secondly, that that legislation will be transmitted to the committee that has jurisdiction over it, which is currently the planning land use and zoning committee. So those are the two substantive changes to the amendment. I'm happy to answer questions, but I know that our clerk would like me to read the official movement into the records that we have this official in front of us and that I will do. Now I move to amend Council Bill 119451 by substituting Section five as presented on the proposed amendment in front of you. Second, as. A council member, Johnson has been moved on. Second has made the amendment. Are there any questions? Just on the amendment only. Any questions on the amendment? Or would you like say, any closing remarks on the amendment? Councilman Johnson Councilmember comes from words or some remarks comes from awareness. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank Councilor Swan and her staff for bringing this very important issue to city council. And I also want to thank Councilmember Johnson for working with me on doing the making this this amendment. I am proud to co-sponsor this amendment. And I also want to thank, of course, the residents and the 47 people that showed up today and on January 22nd to let us know about the concerns about what goes on in the manufactured home mobile park. Some of the comments that I'm making now I made this morning, and we want you to know that we understand how important it is for this city council, any legislative authority to look at protecting the stock of homes that is manufactured homes in mobile parks, and that we know how important it is that we protect the use of such property. We had an opportunity to look at the law and run these issues by law. We had an opportunity to review the legislation to protect the use of such property over 30 years ago. We had an opportunity to look at the Lynnwood model and the Tumwater ordinance and to understand how the federal courts have upheld the city's rights, the legislative rights to protect the use of such property. Our goals here today are to address the lack of housing for our elders, disabled and marginalized communities. We believe that this is an emergency. Things today are not like they were 30 years ago. Obviously, I think it's important that the people that showed here today, particularly the residents, that this has never been a us against them attitude. This has always been about that we care that we want to know the facts, we want to the legal posture, and we also want to know where we are on solid ground to make sure that it isn't just a moratorium, but that we work towards protecting the land and its use. I want to share that something today that I read and actually last night. And I thought about you folks. You know, being on this job, you make difficult decisions. But this was not a hard one for any of my colleagues, quite frankly. But I want to share a quote, and it's really important for me to share this. Democracy cannot survive in a swamp of mutual contempt. I don't know. This country can survive if we all continue to despise each other. You don't have to change your mind about something. You don't even have to like me. You just have to realize that the person you're talking to is a human being. And sometimes we don't do that. So this issue today has always been about being supportive of particularly our elders. I've been at the Halcyon Park. My staff has been out there. Your circumstances have never been lost on us. And so again, I want to thank Councilmember Swan and her staff. I want to thank, more importantly, the residents. I know US chartered busses to come down here. I want to thank my staff who did all the research and the University of Washington, the people that we spoke to, to make sure we understood. I want to thank Legal for giving us the analysis that we need to make sure that we can make a sound decision that lasts. And, of course, I want to thank my colleagues that have come into my office to ask questions of. Councilmember Bagshaw was out there Saturday, I believe. And you really do have a council that cares. So thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Whereas. But I want to address just the amendment right now. There's been an amendment and it's been second. And I'm going to call on that vote. Would you like to see some more words on that concern? Just briefly, you know, I want to offer that as part of public testimony was mentioned, that people are going to be keeping a close eye on me and my committee. And when we're planning to take this up, it's our intention stated in this proposed amendment that we ask for a preliminary list of options to be delivered by April. So if in case people aren't clear enough that we're keeping this as a front burner issue, we're expecting at least a draft list of recommendations to come to us in April with the goal of adopting something before the end of our sort of policy calendar year, which is generally in the September or so time frame. And that's going to include a broad list of options. Many folks have talked about the Portland model, which allows for current property owners to transfer their development rights to other properties. There have been lots of discussions about the access to funds out of Olympia for people to be able to purchase the the land that they sit on for what would effectively be a home ownership opportunity, an edge away type situation. There's a lot of options available to us, so we're going to be discussing this more and looking for recommendations coming as soon as April. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. Okay. So it's been moved on second. And all those in favor of the amendment as articulated by Councilmember Johnson, please say I, I, all the polls say no live. The ayes have it. So now we are back to our base. Legislation as amended would come from our backs. I'd like to say a few words. A quick thank you to all of you. I did get a chance to visit on Saturday again, and I just want to very respectfully say thank you for coming and putting your arms around each other because you've created a caring community that really is a. Model for others. And I'll be honored to be. Voting yes for this moratorium and working with Councilmember Johnson to find the options that will really protect you long. Term. Thank you, Councilman Bagshaw. Consumer. Herbold Thank you. Just really quickly, I want to just sort of give a nod to your vigilance as somebody who used to herself be an organizer with the tenants union, as Ashfield Dickens was once. And I think Reverend Rich Campbell, I don't know if he's still in the room, was a founder of the tenants union. Vigilance is really important. And a lot of times, so many times the folks who are out there in the community in this case, in in your community or in other cases in apartment buildings, really know more about what's going on than than city government does. And so we really rely on you and your expertize and what you're hearing on the ground from your property managers or or from what what you're seeing from talking to one another. I think that's really important. And thank you, because it's really what's. Allowed us. To act. If it if it was not for your vigilance, we would actually be very limited in how we could act if this had gone on much further. So thank you. Thank you. Okay. I will say a couple of comments and then Councilmember Swan and ask that you close the debate on the issue. I'll simply say, number one, thank you. Thank you very much. I think that your story has resonated throughout the city, and I think that the entire city sort of looked at what you're going through and what you shouldn't have to go through. So I'm I'm excited about the discussions that will take place in a Councilmember Johnson's committee. I also heard that there was a park that has not been kept up to the standards that should be kept and some other things. And so I'm going to anticipate that during our budget deliberations, we'll also look at not just fighting for status quo, but what we can do to be a better partner to you. You are fine residents and fine Seattle folks, and so it's our honor to work with you. Thank you again. Thank you, Councilmember Swan, for your leadership in bringing this to the city's attention. And with that comes from everyone, please close the debate. Mr. President, may I make a comment? Oh. I. Timing is always off. But, Councilmember, I'm a skater. Thank you. I'm sorry, ma'am. Thank you. And I know council members won't want to close. I'll just say a few words. You know, I want to lift up some of the comments that Councilmember Johnson also mentioned in terms of the longer term vision, as we work on a comprehensive plan, it must be comprehensive for every family, for every retiree, for every artist , for every activist in Seattle, so that we have affordable housing for those who are currently here or those who've retired here, and for future families who we want to welcome here as well. I think this conversation today is just another reminder that we need to make sure that we're not only investing in more rent restricted, affordable rental units, but that we're creating more affordable homeownership options for everyone, including mobile units, including first time homebuyer options, including the ability to turn apartments like mine into our first time homebuyer options, and creating more affordable units as we create solutions to address the restrictive zoning that has limited our ability to have homeownership options. I think that we at the city level have been pushing our friends at the state level as well to get additional revenue in hand so that we can build quickly and respond more effectively to the fact that we don't have enough housing in the city, housing for our lower income and working families. And we don't have the opportunity to have lower cost homeownership options through affordable condominiums. This has resulted in people getting pushed into the streets and being people getting pushed out of our city. So I look forward to working with all of you as we talk about scaling up the type of housing that we can create in our city, scaling up to make sure that we're more inclusive city, creating more affordable housing for all working families, and that we look at this through a holistic approach to make sure that we are not responding parcel by parcel, but that we have public policies that reflect the values that working families and retirees ought to be able to live in the city. I'll also be working with you as we respond to the question of why the good sister who just left. She asked, Why are we in the situation where we don't have enough affordable housing in the city? And part of the reason why is because we've been we've had our hands tied for far too long with restrictive lawsuits and dragging seats. We have not been able to respond to the crisis of housing and homelessness. And I think what you're seeing here is not just a response to, say, protect the existing housing, but actually make sure that we have permanent, affordable housing for everyone. So let's make sure that this is the impetus that we need, as someone said, so that there's not an island of affordable housing in the mix of expensive housing and that we actually create affordable housing throughout the city. I'm excited to work with you on some of the pieces that Councilmember Johnson mentioned regarding transfer rights, regarding home away opportunities, and I'm going to be introducing legislation in the next few months that will be the tenant opportunity to purchase act so that when apartments like mine get sold while I'm living there, we get notification so that we can have the opportunity to come together and purchase together and we can have access to those resources to make sure that folks have the opportunity to stay in place so that we can afford our homes. I'm really excited to work with you on all types of affordable housing and to to use this as the impetus for longer term, more robust solutions across our city. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can someone get a counselor on this one? Thank you. So we we know that we have come this far to win the moratorium, but as you yourself have said, that is not going to be enough. We need to make sure that the manufactured home park zoning designation goes through and that is not going to be automatic. We are going to have to fight for it. And let me tell you, I've been I've been through this routine many, many times in five years now, where it starts a fight, the fight for some sort of justice, whether it's housing, justice, rent or just as a workers, justice starts with ordinary people demanding it. One or two councilmembers supporting it. A lot of you know. Pushback from a lot of corporate politicians, but when they recognize they cannot, then it's all where we always wanted it. So let's be very clear that we are not going to have to we're not going to be able to stop fighting just because we hear a lot of grand speeches today. We know what we're up against. We're up against a city hall that is primarily still let's let's be sober and not complacent, primarily still dominated by politicians who are, you know, serving corporate interests for the most part, and then are pushed into doing the right thing. So let's make sure that we keep building our movement to do the right thing. I really thank the Association of Manufactured Home Owners. I specifically wanted to thank Island Park for all the organizing effort she has done. Not just but Colin, not just in this battle, but you've all already fight fought a lot of battles. And I really urge you all to continue your work in forming your own homeowner's association. In reality, this homeowner's association will be like a branch of the tenants union because you are fighting for working class home ownership, similar, similar to tenants union, fighting for the rental rights of working class people. I really wanted to also thank the Tenants Union and by Seattle and Devon Southern Air who spoke, which really shows that we need to unite our working people, whether they are homeowners or renters. We need to unite us. We need to get united because our enemy is not each other. Our enemy is a corporate developer dominated city, a billionaire dominated city, as Imogene said. And also the fact is that, you know, a lot of politicians will talk about humanity while whose humanity gets lost in all of this. The humanity of ordinary people gets lost. Because when we lose our affordable housing, when we lose our rights, it's our humanity that is put to the test and that, you know, put to question. And that's why we should continue fighting. We should not apologize for fighting because that is the right thing to do. And let's wear it like a badge of honor. But any of my I was going to close debate. But implicit in your comments were, I think, baseless insults. If anyone liked to respond to it, I'll I'll let you respond. Otherwise, I'll just call for the vote. So. Okay, so we're going to call for the vote. Please call the role on the passage of the amended Bill. Herbold II. Johnson Suarez Macheda I O'Brien sir want. I. Beg John President Harrell all right.

- The City Council voted to pass a moratorium temporarily prohibiting the filing, processing or approval of development applications for the two remaining mobile home parks in Seattle.

- This was in response to the threat of redevelopment and displacement facing residents of the Halcyon Mobile Home Park, many of whom are elderly, disabled or from marginalized communities with few affordable housing options.

- Residents of Halcyon Mobile Home Park organized and advocated strongly for the moratorium, sharing powerful testimonies about how the park provides affordable homes and a caring community. 

- The moratorium aims to preserve this existing affordable housing in the short-term while the City explores longer-term solutions such as:
    - Recommendations from city departments on policies to permanently protect mobile home parks
    - Options like allowing transfer of development rights or facilitating resident ownership 
    - Creating more affordable homeownership opportunities beyond mobile home parks

- Council members praised the residents' vigilance and spoke about the need for robust, holistic affordable housing policies so working families and retirees can remain in Seattle.

- While declaring this an initial victory, some cautioned that the fight is not over to enact permanent protections against displacement from mobile home park redevelopment.

Council Bill 119077 Overview:
- Allows the Capitol Hill Housing Improvement Program (CHHIP), a public corporation chartered by the City of Seattle, to operate and participate in affordable housing projects outside of Seattle. 
- Currently, CHHIP cannot operate beyond Seattle city limits without consent from the city and the other jurisdiction.

- Streamlines the approval process for the CHHIP director to collaborate with other municipalities on housing projects.
- Recognizes the regional nature of the affordable housing challenge beyond Seattle's boundaries.

2) Extend the terms of the contracts to August 1, 2023

   - The priority order for completing this remaining work
   - Whether additional extensions may be needed in a year's time

- After the public comment, the City Council voted to approve Item 31 as recommended.

Transferring jurisdiction of the former loyal heights and finished substation properties from the City Light Department to the Office of Housing for the purpose of developing permanent, affordable home ownership. The committee recommends the bill pass. S member skater. Thank you, Mr. President. This is the grand finale to the grand finale of City Light bills and efforts coming out of the Housing, Health, Energy and Workers Rights Committee. This legislation and the subsequent housing that will be built as a result of this legislation really stems from the work that you all supported last year. The two pieces of legislation that I sponsored in 2018 that said, if we have surplus property in this city, whether it's at Seattle City Light or any other department, we should be maintaining that land in public hands at the city and building affordable housing on it. We were able to do this because of the work of the state legislature who passed in 2018 House Bill 2382, giving Washington the jurisdiction to express it or the express authority to sell, transfer or lease public surplus property at no cost or low cost to other public entities for the purpose of providing affordable housing. So I want to thank represent a review of speaker former speaker Frank Chopp, who led the efforts on this. And we know that this is critically important right now as we think about the overall cost of land in this city continuing to skyrocket. There is a premium on Seattle's real estate market, and the ability to convey underutilized public land removes a major barrier to the creation of affordable housing and community driven development, to the tune of about a 15% reduction in the cost of terms of overall construction of housing. When we build on publicly owned surplus property, we're helping to maintain keeping land in public hands and meet the city's growing need for more affordable homes, reduce displacement and help address the affordability crisis that many of our families are facing. I'm really excited about this piece of legislation in front of you, and I think that it is important to note where these parcels are as we think about increasing access to high opportunity neighborhoods. The sites include Phinney Ridge and Loyal Heights. These are currently vacant, unused parcels of property in access to high opportunity neighborhoods. So think about bus lanes and schools and child care and parks. This is really an area that I think if we get more folks, the ability to live in these neighborhoods and for example, here have permanently affordable home ownership opportunities, we're creating a true transformation in our city that reflects the values of the original intent, which was to help more people be able to stay in the city, to have affordable options and ideally be able to have a smaller commute to their work or to have greater stability in their community overall. We also know that it's not just about where you live and getting from your workplace to home. It's about access to childcare and health clinics, libraries and so much more public spaces. We have deliberately been working through the Office of Housing to make sure that as we create additional housing opportunities, we are looking at helping to serve those who are most at risk of displacement through affirmative marketing and community preference policies that we also included in the disposition policy. This is a really great opportunity for us to basically there's two pieces, two parcels here. One piece relates to City I'm sorry to one. One thing that we're doing is moving land from the city of the city of Seattle City Light Department to the Office of Housing. And we're going to be partnering then when the land gets transferred to Office of Housing with Homestead Community, Land Trust and Habitat for Humanity to invest in creating at least additional 19 condominiums in Finney Ridge and eight family sized townhomes in Boyle Heights. These properties will allow for us to create more homes that will be brought online faster at lower cost, and allow the public investment to be spread further. Thank you again to the partnership of the Washington State Legislature for expressly saying that we have this authority and people questioned. And in the past they passed House Bill 2382 to make it very clear. And here we are at the city of Seattle, the first city to pass in the legislation the ability to transfer land, low cost or no cost. And here we are now. The first city again to enact the tenants of that House bill that sent that state bill and to make sure that we actualize creating affordable housing throughout Seattle. So I'm hoping this is the first of many and really excited to see the disposition policies coming into fruition and action here. Thank you, Casper Macheda. Any questions or comments? If not, please call the rule on the passage of the Bill. Skinner, I O'Brien. Pacheco. I so want I. Bagshaw. Hi. Herbold. I worked for President Harrell High eight in favor and unopposed.

Overview:
- This presentation covered legislation to transfer surplus property from Seattle City Light to the Office of Housing for developing affordable homeownership opportunities. 

Key Points:
- It stems from prior 2018 legislation stating surplus city property should be used for affordable housing.
- A 2018 state law (HB 2382) allowed conveying surplus public property at low/no cost for affordable housing.
- It reduces a major cost barrier (land) by about 15% for affordable housing development. 
- The properties being transferred are vacant parcels in high-opportunity neighborhoods of Phinney Ridge and Loyal Heights.
- This helps increase access to affordable housing in prime neighborhoods near transit, jobs, schools, etc.
- 19 affordable condos planned for Phinney Ridge and 8 family townhomes in Loyal Heights.
- Partnership with non-profits Homestead Community Land Trust and Habitat for Humanity.
- Aims to create permanently affordable homeownership, prevent displacement, spread public investment further.
- Called the ""first city"" to enact the state affordable housing surplus property law.
- Hopes this marks the start of many more such affordable housing initiatives on surplus public land.

The overall intent is to leverage underutilized city-owned parcels in prime areas to cost-effectively create new affordable homeownership opportunities and prevent displacement, guided by recent state legislation enabling this type of property conveyance for affordable housing.",0.8349999999999997,You are an AI assistant summarizing presentations to convey the core content accurately and objectively.

Adding a new Chapter 23.70 to the Seattle Municipal Code. Amending Chapter 23.32 of the Seattle Code at page 14 of the official land use map to establish a mobile home park overlay district, the committee recommends the bill passed as amended. Thank you so much. This is also under councilmember stresses committee responsibilities. I'm going to call on Councilmember Strauss to address the item. Thank you. Council President. This is a moment that I've been long waiting for in part, in large part, most part due to Councilmember Juarez's leadership. This legislation would implement long awaited long term protections for mobile home parks or many furniture, also known as manufactured home parks in Seattle. These protections are a result of a conversation that began over three years ago. Over those three years, we have adopted a moratorium on the redevelopment of mobile home parks and renewed that moratorium repeatedly to provide time for this long term protection that we are going to vote on to be crafted, negotiated. And thanks to Councilmember Warren's avoided court. Three different land use chairs have dealt with this issue since it was since it first arose. And Councilmember Suarez has provided steady leadership on behalf of her district, District five, throughout this entire process. A previous version of this legislation was appealed to a through Examiner over the summer, and we were able to reach a settlement agreement with the appellant to allow us to move forward today because we avoided court. And so this legislation would end the temporary moratoriums by establishing a mobile home park overlay district in the land use code . The way overlay district would apply to the two remaining mobile home parks in the city, the Halcyon and Bellabeat, which are located next to each other in the Bitter Lake Urban Village. The overlay would impose more restrictive development standards to incentivize preservation of the mobile home parks. Specifically, the overlay would limit residential uses to mobile home parks no homes unless the property was sold for the development of affordable housing limit the size of any commercial uses, and establish a height and setback one that match the current mobile home park use of the site. This legislation, the legislation does allow for the possibility of future affordable housing development in the overlay. If that were to occur, there would be strong protections for existing residents. Residents would have the right of first offer, would be entitled to location assistance, and would be able to live in the new affordable housing for rent that is no more than a third of their monthly income. Finally, the overlay would expire after 30 years on January 1st, 2051. This timeframe creates predictability and stability for residents, while still allowing for the site to accommodate more dense housing for future generations. When I was growing up, my grandparents lived in a manufactured home park. I first saw that not how manufactured home parks can be naturally occurring, affordable housing options for many seniors to age in place. And they can also be a source of instability because residents, typically residents, while they own their manufactured home, do not own the land , meet them. And for most manufactured homes out there, if they were ever to be moved, they would be destroyed in that process. And because they don't own the land underneath them, they have the stability and the manufactured home instability without owning that land. And so this legislation ensures that there will be an affordable place to call home for the residents of our last two home parks. Again, thank you to Councilman Juarez and thank you to councilmembers who want to bring this issue up initially in 2019. Thank you, council president. That is the committee report. It is so much. Councilmember Strauss. Casimir was. Are there any comments you'd like to make briefly? Yes, thank you. Council president, since we're saying thank you, we owe a huge thank you to Kittle, who's been working on this since December of 2008. And a huge thank you to our District five director, Dean Alsip, who has been working diligently and visiting and going out to Halcion and Bellerby. And of course, you all have heard from Lynda McCoy. I hope our friends at Bellerby and Halcyon are listening because this really means a lot to them. So thank you. Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss and Councilmember Wars.

- The city council is voting to establish a new Mobile Home Park Overlay District in the land use code to provide long-term protections for Seattle's two remaining mobile/manufactured home parks - Halcyon and Bitter Lake.

- This stems from over 3 years of work, including temporary moratoria on redeveloping these parks, to craft permanent protections.

- The overlay will:
   - Limit allowable uses to manufactured home parks or affordable housing development
   - Restrict size of any commercial uses 
   - Set height/setback limits matching current mobile home park layout
   - Provide strong protections for residents if affordable housing is built, including right of return and rental assistance

- It aims to preserve these naturally affordable housing options, where residents own their manufactured homes but rent the land, preventing displacement.

- The overlay sunsets in 30 years (2051) to allow for potential higher-density housing in the future while providing stability now.

- Council expresses gratitude to Councilmember Juarez for her sustained leadership on this issue crucial to her district, as well as past land use chairs and the city team.

It's my sincere hope that the National Western will be a catalyst for strengthening the health, well-being and education of the residents in the local community and will improve the conditions of the neighborhood infrastructure as well. So I am encouraging all of my colleagues to support my final proclamation for National Western Stock Show tonight. Thank you, Councilwoman Monteiro. Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. If Councilwoman Monteiro remembers that stock show because shopping is over for Christmas, I remember a stock show because the temperatures hovered around zero degrees. And one of the first things I thought about is it must be stuck show time. Congratulations to you on your 109th. Of course, I know you weren't around for the first, but we are so happy to have you leading that effort. And congratulations on a very bold vision for the National Western Center. It's very exciting to read. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Brooks. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I tell you what I am really excited for. I just had. I do. I got to work on it. Listen, I love the National Rosenstock Show because it is inclusive of everyone in Denver. A city slicker like myself, urbanite like myself, can dress up in little cowboy gear and, you know, fill it home. And my kids love it. It's incredible. And so we're not just saying this over 100 you know, 109 years has been incredible. But it's it's it's amazing to see our contemporary society embrace the stock show in the way that we've done. And so thank you, Paul and Paul got it. He gave me a tour of the stock show today. And you don't appreciate what he does until you see the conditions in which the stock show is today. And that's why we put this master plan together to envision something that's going to transform this site in the next ten years. And so you've done a meticulous job and in working on that master plan, but at the same time making sure that the stock show is still vibrant and great for our city and our state. So thank you so much for your hard work. And my daughter Kenya is looking forward to the rotation call the stock show. She calls it the rodeo. She's looking forward to it. So thank you so much. Thank you. Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Cheryl. Yee ha! My Lord, I'm pretty excited about the stock show, too. I was talking to Paul Anders before this and telling him how much writing I've been doing in the last year and I've got my full get up now, so I'm really excited to join the festivities. It was interesting that Councilman Sussman mentioned the temperature because usually the temperature for the well, well-known stock show parade is very cold. But I want to let you know, at least according to my phone, that the parade will be on Thursday at noon and I'm showing a balmy 46 degrees. So there should be no excuses for why you can't come out and enjoy the fun and festivities. And that starts at high noon and it will mostly be marching down 17th Avenue, which is always a treat to see things that we don't normally see here on our downtown downtown streets in Denver. So once again, I'm excited for the kick off of this year's event and very much looking forward to joining the festivities. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Sheppard, any other comments from members of council? I am having problems trying to get connected. Oh, well, go right ahead, Councilwoman. Okay. Sorry. I've been trying to do this, and for some reason, my. My screen is just not working. But I want to. Councilwoman Monteiro said most of everything that needed to be said. But just want to weigh in here as well. This is part of my old council district and have long history with National Western Stock Show. And I'm very glad that National Western made a commitment to long term presence here in the Denver community and has engaged in a process over the last few years with the city of Denver to put together the master plan that we're going to see in more detail later this month. That committee and later this year will have an opportunity to hear more about what those costs look like and how the the overall plan would be financed. But just the fact that this commitment was made, I think is is huge because national western is part of Denver, has been part of the history of the Denver community, not just for the 109 years, but, you know, it's it's part of what Denver is all about. I mean, we were originally a cowtown, and it's one way that people can come and still enjoy that part of our our culture and our history. And for those who are done shopping for the holidays, there's an opportunity to do some shopping at National Western. Any of you who really enjoy the Western apparel, which you see many of us dressed in tonight, you know, it's one place where you can go buy boots and skirts and all kinds of different things for the ladies anyway. Anyway, congratulations on your 109 years of existence. Look forward to the opportunity to spend some time over at the stock show and heard you on the radio this morning saying, Yeah, so it's a great time. I know this week we have a number of different luncheons and events where people come together and really gear up to support the two week, actually three weekend two week event that takes place at National Western, which really is important because at this time of the year, after people have spent during the holidays, you know, it's it's where we get that that shot in the arm to our economy through the events put on by national yesterday. So thanks for all you do and look forward to the next couple of weeks. Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, any other comments from members of the council? Seen none. Madam Secretary. Raquel Montero. Hi, Nevitt. Hi, Ortega. I'm Rob Shepherd. Susman. Brooks Brown. Hi, Fats. I can eat lemon. Hi, Mr. President. Hi. I'm secretary. Please close the voting, announce the results. 1212 ize proclamation ten has been adopted. Councilman Monteiro, is there anyone with the cowboy hat in the audience you want to invite up to the podium to cover? I'm looking there. There certainly is. But before I call up Paul Andrews, I wanted Sky Steward. If you could take a message back to Mayor Hancock and just let him know that we appreciate that he heard us loud and clear several years ago when there was a threat that we could you lose national western. And since that time, you know, being able to get funding to do the master plan and the Elyria, Swansea neighborhood plans and all the attention that's going into this particular area, if you could just tell them, thank you and we'll keep up the good work. Appreciate it. Thank you. So, Mr. Andrews, would you come up to the podium, please? If you want to say hee haw, that's good. I could never say it is cool. You know, all my all my ideas go in the radio when I do that radio promotion stuff. But now I'm always so humbled to come here before all of you and and really hear the nice comments that you all have for us. And it's really a humbling experience. So thank you all. As you know, this week kicks off the National Western Stock Show 109th edition. What we didn't mention here tonight is that our grand marshal for the parade this Thursday is none other than the king of Park Hill. My man, Chauncey Billups is the grand marshal of the parade. So all of you, on that 50 degree day that we're going to have, which I call stock show, whether this Thursday come out route on hometown hero Chauncey and then the start of the national western. You know we are the Super Bowl of livestock shows Barnum. We're the most prestigious in the world. We are the largest horse show in North America. I don't know that everyone knows that. With over 13,000 horse entries in our show over 16 days and the shopping experience is second to none as well. And we have 29 rodeos that are a plus. Rodeos you will not find a better rodeo. I give all the credit to the board of the nation of Western and to my great staff that puts all this on. It's just a great experience to go through. So I think before I in my comments tonight, though, I appreciate the time that you've given me, I would be remiss without thanking the greatness of Council District nine that has been led for many, many years by Judy Monteiro. And Judy, I can tell you that when we honor you at this year's rodeo, I will be the first one standing up for your standing ovation. Thank you so much for all you've done for the neighborhood and all you continue to do. Sitting in that chair. So thank you from the nation of Western Stock Show so much. And we'll see you at the hunt. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Andrews. Thank you, Councilwoman. All right, we're on to the resolutions. Madam Secretary, please read the resolutions.","A proclamation welcoming the 109th National Western Stock Show, Rodeo and Horse Show to Denver.

There were some amendments looking at the organization and duties as well, and also making sure that LGBTQ members were involved in the commission and also recognized as their own pathway as part of the black men and the Commission on Black Men and Boys. It's very exciting to see us again, to create history and to push this forward, to make sure that the vital conversations about how the city moves in any community, but especially when dealing with black men and boys, is at the table front and center.

The work to create a commission on black men and boys in Boston started seven years ago. I'm in for context. It predates predated President Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative. It passed the council in 2014 unanimously before being vetoed by Mayor Walsh. But the need for this commission has not gone away since it's been vetoed. Back in in 2014. Since then, we have continued to see disproportionately impacts of black men and boys in all sectors, from education to health and wellness to economic empowerment to violence. The need for this commission never went away, and neither did the advocates who have been pushing for this. Pointless. Tito Jackson Councilor. Former Councilor. Tito Jackson. Ron Bell.

I want to say I want to talk a little bit about the process and how we got here, because it's always paved in lots of zigzags. In June of this year, we introduced this ordinance after seven years of no council action. Here we are three months later and we are prepared to pass it today. It looks like we meet the moment and answer the call to action. We all rise to that occasion. This ordinance is essentially the same thing that the council passed in 2014 with only a few key changes. First, we made revisions based on Mayor Walsh's veto back in 2014 to ensure that this ordinance is in compliance with our city charter. Second, we have given the Commission the ability to hold community conversations on topics that impact black men and boys. We spoke with the community and came to the agreement that this ordinance is doing everything possible to impact change on behalf of black men and boys in the city. We have the opportunity to make history. This ordinance matters because black men and boys matter. We have an obligation to step into the space and let people in and create space for people to step into their power. And let those as our colleague, a congresswoman. Now, Ayanna Pressley, says the people closest to the pain should be the people closest to the power. Thank you again to the advocates for getting us to this point.

Communication from Councilwoman Sarah Chair, Public Safety Committee Recommendation to request City Council to approve the Motion of the Public Safety Committee of on February 25th, 2022 to support Assembly Bill 1621 to enact legislation relating to unsterilized firearms. Thank you, Councilman Zoro. Thank you, Vice Mayor. So, yes, so back in February 25th during Public Safety Committee, we made a motion to support this legislation. But at that time, it was an intent bill. And I wanted to make sure we had it amended to be policy before bringing it forward to council today. And it was amended back on the 26, which and that is why it's here today. And so when I think, you know, the police will be PD for doing a presentation on those guns as well as the increasing violence or increasing gun violence. And I think that this item is timely given that President Biden's just announced a ban just yesterday on unlicensed kits to manufacture the ghost gun, which I believe. I am wondering if we can have Mr. Curley explain how how this work with this ban, federal ban, and how would it work with our state legislation? And also how would that impact are the local feasibility that was just passed last week? And so I'm wondering if you could answer those question. Absolutely. Thank you, Councilwoman. So essentially, the state bill that is the core focus of this item would expand the definition of what constitutes a firearm in terms of what's required for, you know, having a serial number, tracking purposes and regulation. The federal rule that was announced yesterday by the president does very similar thing in terms of essentially requiring background checks and serial numbers for kits that are used to be able to create firearms. The main difference, of course, though, is just essentially a jurisdictional issue. So the federal rule would apply to the ATF, whereas the state rule or law, if it were passed, would apply to state level local law enforcement as well. But at this point, they are complementary in terms of their policy approach to addressing the issue of ghost guns. Thank you. Well, then, I think with that being said, I really like staff to take it into consideration with the federal ban that was just done, the announcement on the ban by the president as well as the state bill. And we can take that into consideration as we're thinking about a local feasibility study on how that would be impacted, because I am just concerned that we may spend all this time to do a local study when we and then come to find that the federal as well as the state ledge could just really supersede all of that. So thank you very much. And yes, thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Durango. Thank you, Councilmember, truly for bringing this forward because we're so sorry that presentation that we received at the Public Safety Committee was very enlightening, very educational, very informative. And we know that this has reached the federal level. I think it speaks volumes about what is out there and the dangers that these guns pose. For our. Local community. So I'm very glad to support this item. Councilman Price. Thank you. And Councilwoman Zoro, thank you so much for bringing this item. What a great idea for us to take up. And I'm so grateful that we're doing that tonight. I think it's very timely. I think the purpose of last week's item was to kind of. Look at what. Local ordinances. We could and put into our municipal code that would strengthen the municipal code in regards to ghost guns specific. To misdemeanors. So I agree with you. I think if there is some state. Legislation that supersedes, then obviously the municipal code would be moot. But my understanding of the state legislation is that right now is that it doesn't incorporate some of the enumerated actions that we deemed would potentially be a misdemeanor if committed in the. City of Long Beach. Such as possession of parts and things of that nature. So I look forward to the report coming back. And I think this is this is a fantastic item. I would like to. Offer a friendly. That we direct staff to. Support the federal. Efforts to stop ghost guns. Introduced by President Biden earlier this week. As part of. Our efforts to. Really take a look at ghost guns. It's been often. When we. Yeah. So actually because it's a federal legislation, I like to for it to go to the Fed large committee if that's possible. So I don't know it's to make up. Oh it's the so you're accepting the friendly by but alternative to say to send it. To go to the fat ledge. Committee. Okay Councilman Austin so I'm glad to see this item here. And I think this reinforces our conversation from a week ago where we were having the same conversation about the same issue of ghost guns. They are creating quite a challenge and in our community they are public safety challenged in a big way. And so I commend Councilmember Ciro for for bringing this item this week. Again, we had a conversation last week. Councilmember Price brought something last week as well. And it just this is a double down effort. And I think this sends the right message to the residents of Long Beach and anybody that comes in Long Beach that, you know, goes guns won't be tolerated, gun violence won't be tolerated in our city. So I'm happy to support this item. And I agree we should be having a full court press on this from the federal level, from the state level and the local level to keep our residents safe. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Councilwoman Day has. Thank you. Thank you. Council member Sara for bringing this item forward. Ghost guns are dangerous. They they increase the level of unsafe D. In our city and our. Neighborhoods and make it more challenging to address since they are on serialized weapons. So thank you very much for bringing this item forward. And I do feel and agree with those who spoke before. It is a very timely to coordinate this with the with the state and federal regulations that are happening. So think. Thank you. And before we go back to Councilman Ciro, just at my support for the item, I like everything I heard here today. I think we're in a good place. So we're talking about, you know, we're acknowledging the legislation happening in the state, acknowledging what President Biden is doing. And we have a local effort we discussed last week. So it's thorough, happy to support it. Councilman Allen Yeah, I agree with everything you just said. Vice Mayor in supporting from the federal to the state, I think this is a is a huge problem. And anybody, you know can purchase these gun kits and get their hands on these kits, people that have serious criminal backgrounds, people involved in domestic violence. I mean, even kids can get their hands on these these kits. And and a person who comes from a law enforcement background, these are really dangerous. And so I appreciate what we're doing and all my colleagues and all their efforts and support this wholeheartedly. Thank you. Thank you. Any public comment? Let's see. We have one tonight, I can say. Thank you. I just want to speak in full support of Assemblyman Mike Gibson's bill. I think that in support of the AR chair and vice chair, uh, the public safety committee for bringing this up, I think that, um, the government is, is kind of reconciling with the conversation about the plague of ghost guns. I mean, we had a very tragic mass murder here in the city of Long Beach, October 29, 2019. That was in effect due to go scans, uh, here on seventh. And, um, and, um, and, and temple, you know, it was a, it was a Halloween party that I was on my way to attend. And a childhood friend of mine was murdered as a result of ghost guns. So for me, this strikes very near and dear to my heart. A lot of the gun violence that we're currently engaged in currently is being engaged with in the streets right now is essentially people buying these kids off of the Internet and finding a way, a loophole to, uh, you know, of our municipal code to get around and establishing, you know, contact with these, with these items and murdering people because they know they can get away with it because there's no serial number. I mean, there was a shooting just today in New York in the subway, and they're still trying to figure out how that firearm was allowed. And I'm pretty sure, you know, I don't want to speculate, but I'm pretty sure that two was a ghost gun. And so, you know, I know we're in the implementation process of, you know, with with with the law about how we're going to engage with this. But I think that most people that have these items are, in effect, stone cold out to be murderers. I'm a legal gun owner myself. I have multiple firearms. And I have to go through a very lengthy background check in order to go through that process. So not to outdoors. I mean, certainly no, uh, local business. But with that said, no one's dealing with this within themselves with these ghost guns. And we're just going to see in the next 5 to 10 years, it's going to be an epidemic, much the same alignment of the opioid crisis that we're currently dealing with. So I appreciate the counsel for stepping forward and getting ahead and making this happen. Thank you. Thank you. Members, please cast your vote. Motion is carried. Thank you. Now we're going to go to Na Na Na agenda. Public comment. We have three speakers Ray Lawson, Rafael Pimentel and Tatiana Jensen.","Recommendation to request City Council to approve the motion of the Public Safety Committee on February 25, 2022, to support Assembly Bill 1621 to enact legislation relating to unserialized firearms.","Here is a summary of the main points from the presentation in a clear, concise format:

A resolution relating to Seattle Public Utilities establishing an ongoing customer review panel to maintain continuous stakeholder engagement as SPU implements a six year strategic business plan and conducts future plan updates. The committee recommends that resolution be adopted. Councilmember Herbold, Thank you. This resolution is following up on an amendment that we made during the Strategic Business Plan for Seattle Public Utilities last year and is a recommendation from the Customer Review Plan panel last year as well. The Customer Review Panel has argued that they would be able to deliver more value for their participation if they were empaneled as a permanent review panel. City Light also has a permanent review panel. Seattle Public Utilities met with the customer review panel to get their recommendations on this resolution, and those recommendations were incorporated prior to sending the legislation to council. The panel will have nine members, four appointed by the council and five by the mayor. Each term will be three years, except that the initial term of positions one through four shall be 27 months. In the initial term of positions, five through nine shall be 39 months. This is done in order to stagger the appointments. The customer review panel is expected to start meeting regularly in April and I think the value added to there being a permanent panel as opposed to a panel that we bring together whenever we want to look at updates to the strategic business plan and rates is that they they can actually serve a really important role in helping us implement the actions of the strategic business plan. And one of the things that I'm going to really count on their assistance on in 2018 is to implement one of the recommendations that we included in the strategic business plan, which is to begin to institute system system development charges so that the developers of housing are paying for the infrastructure costs associated with drainage and wastewater, rather than those costs being picked up as they are today by the general ratepayer. This is a real big driver of increased rate costs. Very good. Any further comments? Those in favor of adopting the resolution. Please vote i i those opposed vote no. The motion carries the resolutions dropped in chair was silent. Please read the next gen item.",A RESOLUTION relating to Seattle Public Utilities (SPU); establishing an ongoing Customer Review Panel to maintain continuous stakeholder engagement as SPU implements the six-year Strategic Business Plan (Plan) and conducts future Plan updates.,"Presentation Summary:

Okay. As provided for under RTW 42.17 a point 555, the city Council will now consider the adoption of Resolution 31860 that those read into the record. And at the conclusion of Councilmember comments, the Council will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak on the resolution. This resolution, of course, endorses Seattle School, Seattle School District's Propositions one and two, which relate to operation and building infrastructure funding. On the February 12th, 2019 special election ballot and approximately equal opportunities to to speak will be given to members of the public. Thanks for reading the item into the record and I'll relinquish the floor to Councilmember Johnson. Thanks. I bring this forward on behalf of not only my colleague, Councilmember Gonzales, but also all those of us who are parents of kids in public schools. The two of in front of voters this February present a unique opportunity for us to continue our decades long partnership between the City of Seattle and the school district and its board of directors on complementary investments. And the investments that are in front of voters this February are critical ones. Not only do we have a very, very long list of capital investments that would transform and reconstruct several schools throughout the city. But also we'll make investments in nearly, if not every single school in the city of Seattle. But in addition, the operating levy, commonly referred to as the PTA levy, also has a set of critical operational investments that are necessary for all of our students to excel in all of our Seattle public schools. So there's an ongoing partnership between the city and the school district, I think is a critical one, and I'm super excited to see this ambitious plan on the ballot and looking forward to voting yes myself. Very good. Councilmember Becky Shaw, thank you so much, Mr. Johnson, for your leadership on this. And I'm wondering if you could just hold up that map and the back side of it. There are no. Further people can. Give it to you. Thank you. So what I appreciated about this map, and I'm not sure that we can even begin to have it focused from the Seattle Channel, but this is the number of schools that will be aided by this particular levy. And the back side of it identifies, I mean, almost to the dollar. What kinds of things will be done at each elementary, middle school and high school? So I know that there has been some controversy around this. People are saying, well, how come that the McCleary decision didn't take care of it? Well, then it clearly didn't. McCleary decision didn't take care of it. And so for us to continue to have the great air quality public school system that we want, we need to support this levy. And I'm happy to be doing that. So thank you for bringing this forward. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, thank you. And I did just want to speak to some of the controversy that Councilmember Bagshaw alluded to. There was a Seattle Times editorial last week that I made some inquiries about. They had to two contentions, one related to the size of the operations levy, and the second related to concern that it would be the levy would be undermining sort of the basic tenet of McCleary, which is to make sure that there is there there isn't unequal funding in school districts across the state where cities with school districts and taxpayers who are willing and able to fund basic education are able to do so more plentifully than other school districts. And what I learned from my inquiry is that it is true that the size of the operations levy, the request in the levy itself is a different number than what they can currently be legally collected. It is in excess of the legally authorized collection amount, but that doesn't mean that they're going to be able to collect all that money. The plan is, again, and I think this is very consistent with the intent of McCleary. The plan is to go back to the state legislature this year to increase the amount that can legally be collected. Under state law. Thus maintaining that strong commitment that we have to make sure that different school districts across the state are not put in different positions depending on whether or not those particular districts are able to to pass. LEVY So in in in essence, increasing the the collection amount gives the Seattle Public Schools some some flexibility because by asking for the additional capacity now, they don't have to go back if the state law is itself changed. And then the other point that I think is important to note that there was a question about the use of the dollars and again, whether or not the use of the dollars is consistent with the legislative decisions made in the legislature last year. And I think it's important to take note that the State Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction approved the Seattle Public Schools plan for the operations levy and took the position that it is, in fact, consistent with state law. Thank you. Thanks for those comments because my HERBOLD, any further comments? If not, we're going to move to public hearing any further comments. Okay. So as required by law, we have to sign up sheets for Proposition one and Proposition two. So I'm going to. Call you out in the order that you sign it. Sign up and we'll start off. Just one moment. Here, give me one sec. Okay. So we'll start off with Mr. Alex Zimmerman and following Mr. Zimmerman will be Melissa Pailthorpe. It's on proposition number one. I have to say she. So should I go to first and second? It's a little bit confusing, I'm sure. Mr. Chairman, I humbly apologize for interrupting. Can you start his time back, please? It may I have to sign up sheets, but the same people sign up for both. And so. Yeah. Why don't we just speak on both of them? No problem. One and two. So you're absolutely. Right. Proposition one and Proposition two. Absolutely. Absolutely right. Yeah. I'm very happy when I see something common sense, which was very unusual in this chamber. So situation right now, very simple. Yes, it's exactly what is I want explained you money need for school so exactly. Absolutely I'm not too much sure how much money this money what we have here, we're talking about billions. My experience with this board of school director. But as I come in circles as pupils, very low, primitive, not professional, we cannot give this people a chance. Operate with billion dollars. We need somebody who's have different opinion. They have same opinion like you should belong in you same principle. Like you use more money. More money in still in mind. Is this exactly what's happened? We are talking about billions and billion dollars. You know, I'm absolutely sure, like profession professional, business consultant, because I don't have speeches for couple of minutes. We have more than enough money. And now in this system, we can fix it every cent, ten times cheaper. Five times cheaper, maybe three times, but much cheaper. So this happen and happen again and again. But what this I want to talk to right now about the of our operation with money in business principle what is every business have government or not government seven under thousand idiot who live in this city deserve a government 7 billion and billion dollars. I'm very happy with this because when 700,000 idiot pay a billion and billion dollars per billion and billion dollars, a billion and billion dollars for transportation for school for every cent in got better. So I'm very happy when this 700,000 natural born degenerate idiot will be a cop and Colin Campbell like you totally in scold but I'd like to totally because of this you look right now is a pure fascism when government together with corporation suck blood and mind you from us stop fascism cleanse this chamber. Stand up, America. Okay, these were all in line with the public now. So Melissa will be followed by Jake Ewert. Hi. My name's Melissa Pailthorpe. I'm the president of Schools. First, the organization that mobilizes the Get Out the vote campaign for the school levies. And here as a volunteer and a parent in our public schools. Thank you all for supporting this resolution. I think council member bags have pointed out that the capital levy has significant funding and improvements for the buildings across the city, which is really critical. We have a number of aging buildings. We've been working on that for a while and we have to keep working on improving those for our kids. And as Councilmember Johnson pointed out, we do have a funding gap between the McCleary solution and what we're able to raise locally. So our E.P.A. levy this year is absolutely critical. And as Councilmember Herbold pointed out, we are asking for additional authority, knowing that we would have to, in fact, have legislative action to collect on that. Seattle is not unique in that several districts are taking this tack because we don't want to have to come back to voters and ask again and spend more resources and time on that. So thank you for your support for our 53,000 kids and appreciate all the work that you're doing. I would also like to remark that this does go hand in hand with the fact, Larry, we need both pieces to make this work in our city. So thank you for that as well. And I want to apologize on behalf of Greg Wang because he had to leave, but that was the point that he wanted to make . So thank you. Thank you, Jake. You are. Hi. My name is Jake Ewert. I'm a volunteer with schools. First you just heard about I'm also a parent of kids in the Seattle Public Schools. I've got a second grader, a kindergartner, and a little guy will be in kindergarten soon. These levees are really important to me, very, very important to the city. The Capitol levee is obviously important to improve and replace some schools in the operations levee. Obviously important to bridge the gap between all the improvements and funding the state has made and the money that public schools need for services. Now, a lot of folks have been moving to this town and will continue moving here, interested in putting their kids in Seattle public schools. It's really important that we continue investing in them. I know one thing about the money that's going to be collected, every single dollar is going to be used to support our kids. So it's a great investment. I urge you to vote yes. Thanks very much. Thank you. And thanks for letting us know Greg was not here, but we did have him, his and Greg on the same street. And Greg, thank you for all the work you're doing. Okay. Seeing no further speakers signed up to speak either in favor or opposition to the resolution. The public comment period for this time will be closed. The Council now proceed with the vote on the resolution 31860. Okay. Those in favor of adopting a resolution 31860. Please vote i i. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries the resolution is adopted than chair will sign it. Thank you very much. With pleasure. Is there any further business coming for the council? It's a 3:00 for the Select Committee on Image as they've got about 12 minutes. Right. Thank you. And we'll be back on the dais. Counselor. I'm a skater. Mr. President, I'd like to ask to be excused. Next Tuesday, I'm going to be traveling to Washington, D.C., to serve on the National Task Force for addressing homelessness and housing with the National League of Cities and honored to be there on behalf of 18 other cities.

Clara, could you please regain item 18? Communication from Councilman Austin. Vice Mayor Andrew's recommendation to request the city attorney to draft an ordinance to authorize the city manager to issue local temporary cannabis. Special Event Permits. Good. We will do another report on that. Or you want. You take it. I need to speak. Need to speak first. Yes. Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay. Councilman Pierce, please. I plan on recusing myself from participating in this item due to the possibility of a conflict of interest. I have a financial interest in two business entities in the cannabis industry through prior consulting work with DHS, Verde LLC and Global Growth Investments and their principal partner, Danza Ronnie. While there has been no formal determination regarding the financial effects of this decision on these particular entities, I am recusing myself out of abundance of caution and would appreciate when staff notifies me that this item has been concluded. Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilman Orson. Thank you very much. So the Long Beach voters have repeatedly voted to approve the sale and use of cannabis in our city. Long Beach's ordinance allows for the cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and the sale of cannabis products. However, Long Beach Ordinance, Long Beach's ordinance does not address temporary cannabis events, and so they are not currently permitted. As of January 1st, 2018. The State of California began issuing state temporary cannabis event licenses, which authorize events with onsite adult use, cannabis sales and consumption pursuant to the state's medical and Adult Use, Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act. Some other cities in California have begun permitting cannabis related special events. For example, in Santa Rosa, the Emerald Cup has been successful, a been successful special event that features entertainment, education, competitions, sales and consumption. Last year, the Emerald Cup generated over $200,000 in tax revenue and about $17.3 million in total economic output for the community. The Convention Center has also received inquiries about holding trade shows for their cannabis or CBD products. Given Long Beach's success in hosting many notable special events. This seems to be an opportunity to include a local temporary cannabis special event at specific locations with controls in place for other special events. This could also be an opportunity for Long Beach businesses to benefit from these events, and the city can foster that local economic benefit. I understand that there are many factors that the city staff in the city attorney's office will have to look at and discuss to make this work as an ordinance. And I also understand the state law requires the city to identify specific locations in the ordinance where a temporary special event would be allowed. With that said, therefore, I would like to make a motion that is slightly revised from the agendas motion to request the city attorney to work with the city manager and appropriate departments, and in return to the City Council within 60 days with a draft ordinance that would allow the city manager to issue local temporary cannabis special event permits, provided that all appropriate criteria for special events are met. And at least 75% of the retailers at the event are Long Beach, based at the Queen Mary Events Park and allow the Convention Center to host cannabis CBD related trade shows business to business that involve the sale of such products without consumption. Ask my colleagues for their support. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Orson. I do also you will second this motion because in fact, I think we need to have some form, you know, like I say, where we can go and see what are we going to work this? Because it can be. But in process, I think we still need to go to our city council. I see the attorney to find out what we have to do and can do. So thank you again for my colleague for bringing this forward to anyone and anyone. And honestly, I can speak on this item. Please, come on. State. Your name, please. Very good, Hugh. Not only repeating the objections I had last time this came forward. I would just say it's really a strong indictment. Of this council. You say that you cannot. Meet the needs of this city. Without the revenue from this. And I remind you, I'm reminded of the. The reprimand delivered by Haile Selassie. Decades ago. Relative to inappropriate behavior. The dollar cost of this. We'll be more than this city will be able to measure. I urge you to reject this. And find another way. You get center city revenues. Other than this. Absurd. Rely on relying on drugs. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Goodman. The next speaker. Good evening. Mayor, vice mayor and city council members, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with you this evening. My name is. Jim Louis and I'm the head of special projects for Red Light Management, as well as the festival director for the Emerald Crop, the largest and most respected outdoor cannabis competition and consumer event in the world. I bring over three decades of experience to the Emerald Cup and I've been producing thousands of events, concerts, festivals around the world . Our company, Red Light Management, besides managing over 250 musical artists and more important to this conversation, has ownership in most of the major music festivals in North America, including Outside Lands with San Francisco, Lollapalooza in Chicago, Austin City Limits and South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee. The Emerald Cup takes place each December in Santa Rosa. The resulting in economic impact to the region is significant. Per the Beacon Economic Impact Report, the 2018 Cup generated 17 million to the county. The events is supported more than 200 jobs and 271 local vendors. And half of the nearly 30,000 attendees stayed in hotels and private homes in. In the area. The Emerald Cup is grateful to the City Council for the opportunity to develop an events ordinance and is enthused by the prospect of building it on the legacy we've created by launching an annual event in Long Beach beginning next year. I can tell you. That producing these events and implementing and planning perspective takes a minimum of six months to develop the compliance and infrastructure for an event of this nature. Thus, we urge you to continue expeditious policy development to allow us to announce a 2020 event by the end of the year. The Cup is the ideal partner for the city. We have a stellar record of compliance, secure operations and positive impacts to the community. Finally, we understand that while the burgeoning legal cannabis industry represents significant economic opportunity, many local jurisdictions are grappling with low or excuse me, with how to implement public policy that balances economic opportunity with the public health and safety. The economic excuse me, the Emerald Cup has achieved this balance and would welcome the opportunity to show you this firsthand. I invite you to join us at the Emerald Cup this weekend in Santa Rosa. We would be happy to give you a tour of the event, its infrastructure, security and operations, and provide a real time case study on economic impact and how licensed cannabis events can function. Excuse me appropriately and beneficially within the community. Thank you very much. Next speaker. Good evening, vice mayor and council members. I want to follow up with what Jim said about the Emerald Cup and the professionalism in pulling off a successful event in Santa Rosa. They've had no incidents at all since they started the event at the County of Sonoma Fairgrounds. To confirm that, I reached out to Long Beach PD along Beach Fire over the past several days and gave them their respective counterparts and their phone numbers up in Santa Rosa so that they could do their due diligence and determine the success of the event. Lessons learned and all that. In addition to that, Emerald Cup has also reached out the Santa Rosa Chamber and Santa Rosa Events Bureau to have them contact their counterparts in Long Beach, the CVB, the Hospitality Alliance in the Long Beach Chamber. Finally, we also provide to city and elected staff contacts with the State of California Bureau of Cannabis Control, the chief Laurie Ajax, and Governor Newsom's point person on cannabis, Nicole Elliott. We want to be as transparent as possible. We want you to do your due diligence as you go through this. We invite staff to call their counterparts in the state of California. Also in Santa Rosa, we've got nothing to hide. We encourage you to move us forward quickly. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And hello. Good evening, counsel.

Thank you. Now we'll move forward with item 19, please. Communication from Councilwoman Allen Councilman's and Diaz. Vice Mayor Richardson Recommendation to request city manager to work with the Health and Human Services Department to provide an overview of the food safety program, education and enforcement at food facilities. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen. Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor. I brought this item in response to some concerns that I have heard raised by restaurant owners in my district and which I know they have also been echoed elsewhere in the city. There are 2200 operators in our city and that's a huge number. These operators are small business owners, families, community partners. They are also donors who support youth sports leagues, neighborhood associations and their innovations in food and their continued presence in Long Beach are helping drive the city's economic and the tourism resurgence. Over the past two years, restaurants and caterers in Long Beach and across this country has suffered challenge after challenge. And it's become apparent that there is a disconnect here. So I would like us as a council to ask the health department to update us on their processes, especially with sidewalk vending and food truck regulatory processes starting. We must reassure the brick and mortar operators that fairness is is top of mind. We also ensure that fairness is the starting point for inspections and for regulations for both brick and mortar and for the mobile food facilities. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Sara. Yes. I just want to add my support to this item. This is a great item, Councilwoman Allen, and thank you for council members and Dana and vice mayor for signing on. I just want to reiterate how important it is to make sure there is clarity around the education and process, as we do want to consider how we're doing and ensuring everyone has the appropriate information to do business because that's really what we want to make sure we do, is ensure our businesses are successful, that they're not limited or hindered by some of these process if we are able to make them available and clear, especially for our sidewalk vendors as we're going to be moving through with our state legislation process and other ways that we're going to try to make sure we support their business as well as our brick and mortar. So just support this item. Great item. Thank you, Councilwoman Zendaya's. Thank you and thank you to Councilwoman Allen for bringing up this very, very important item. I think it's very important that we really look at how we can help our brick and mortar businesses that that are serving food. I think that in the last few years, it has been really hard, and that's only an understatement. And if you're a business owner out there, a restaurant in this town there, you know that that is very true. And one of the things that I think is important is for all of us to be on the same page and understand that there's certain things, certain processes that that our brick and mortar businesses have to go through. And with those processes can be then one of the things that's very important to me and why I support this item very much is that a lot of those fees sometimes hurt our businesses instead of helping them. And one of the things that we really want to do is be able to help these businesses, especially because if they thrive, all of our communities thrive. So very, very happy to support this side of things. Councilwoman. Thank you. You have emotion and a second believe there's no additional comments. If there is a. Common. Yes, there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item 19 in person. Please line up at the podium there. Any members of the public that would like to speak on item 19 in Zoom, please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine. No. In person. You know, I'm going to have to give Mr. Supernova's props, because I think that that nine one vote sorry, eight one vote that we had the other day was prophetic. We're going to have issues. City of Los Angeles is already starting to hunker down on the health and sanitary conditions of a lot of the vendors. It doesn't really make sense. I pay for a city license, a business license. I operate a storefront. I don't think it's fair for a lot of us in terms of preparation. What we have to deal with in comparison to the lack of those type of standards being applicable to people just because they're outside. I think that I want to be fair and courteous to the communities that those come from. But, you know, speaking from personal experience, you know, my grandmother almost died from a E.coli experience that she had with a sidewalk vendor. And so it's not to say or to cast that a shadow or a cloud on everyone. But, you know, I know if there's no operator health person going to every single thousands of people who are operating throughout the city and inspecting if they have a side thing or, you know, if they're up to standard. So there needs to be some type of byline that we can all bridge about because when liability is concern, I'm sure the city knows that it always lands in the lap of, you know, the general fund. So hopefully we can come to some agreement about what sanitation looks like for food preparation. And you know what? What's the future to be? Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Cipriano. As long as Mr. Can for a reference meeting, I thought I should go ahead and speak. I know we have staff here, so if I could ask a question about health inspections now. It's my understanding that the health guidelines are established at the state level. If there's that if there's a training component locally, would that not have to be state driven? And if there's not an answer for that because you haven't looked into this yet, I completely accept that. But to my way of thinking, I didn't understand how a local health official who is burdened with making inspections would have the time or the authority to train individual operators in restaurants. Good afternoon, counsel. I'm from. My name is Morgan Warfield. I am with the Environmental, Health, Health and Human Services. I'm the operations officer. Thank you for having me here. The training does come from the state, either from California, Department of Health or sometimes from FDA. We have a standardization that is overseen by FDA. We also provide training every time that we have interaction with our food establishments, either it's from the owner or from the manager or any of the employees within the establishment. Okay. Thank you for that. And that's my understanding that what training comes about, then it's incumbent on the operator of the restaurant to go ahead and train staff. So based on that and the fact that I have not received any complaints from restaurant tours, that I will not be in support. Thank you. Thank you. There is a motion and a second. Members, please go and cast your votes. District one. Oh, I'm sorry. We actually need to do roll call. We have two folks that are virtual. So remarkable. District one. Right. District two i.

- Councilwoman Allen raised concerns voiced by restaurant owners in her district about perceived unfairness and disconnect regarding food safety regulations and enforcement for brick-and-mortar restaurants versus mobile food vendors/food trucks.

- With over 2,200 food operators in the city, many small businesses investing in the community, Allen wants to ensure fair and consistent processes across all food facility types.  

- Councilmembers Suarez and Zendejas expressed support, citing the need for clarity in processes to not hinder businesses' success, especially given challenges restaurants faced during the pandemic.

- A public commenter raised issues about potential health risks and lack of equal oversight for sidewalk vendors compared to brick-and-mortar restaurants adhering to sanitation standards.

- City staff clarified that while health guidelines come from the state, they provide training to food establishments during inspections, with operators responsible for training their staff.

- The council voted 8-1 to request the city manager and Health department provide an overview of the food safety program, education, and enforcement processes for different food facility types to address fairness concerns.

Whereas quality, affordable housing is vital to building healthy, safe, vibrant and diverse communities. And. Whereas, affordable homes are the solution to homelessness and provide support to seniors, families, youth, veterans, and people with disabilities. And. Whereas, rising housing costs have led longtime residents to be displaced, live in overcrowded and substandard homes, or become homeless, threatening our region's diversity and economic prosperity, and first, creating new permanent, affordable homes. And preserving and improving existing rental housing helps our residents maintain community roots and encourages social and economic diversity for generations. And. WHEREAS, development of affordable homes close to public transit and jobs can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide low income families better access to opportunities and amenities. And. Whereas, empowering residents living in affordable housing as advocates helps to shape better housing, tenant protections and development policies. And. Whereas, nonprofit organizations, local jurisdictions, community organizations and many others continue to build inclusive communities by providing shelter, homes and support for low income people and those with special needs. And. Whereas, East Bay housing organizations has organized affordable housing week for 19 years and will feature 21 events acknowledging the need for and contributions of affordable housing. Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Treasurer Spencer, Mayor of the City of Alameda, do hereby proclaim May eight through 17th, 2015 as the 19th Annual Affordable Housing Week in the city of Alameda. If further resolved that the City of Alameda will work to support affordable housing at the local, regional and state level and will encourage residents of the City of Alameda to participate in affordable housing week activities. Thank you. And feel free to say a few words. Okay. Hopefully we'll just be a few. We also have Neill Saxby from Eden Housing. So there will be three of us speaking. I think he was originally scheduled to accept the proclamation along with us. Thank you. Laura Thomas renewed hope housing advocates. I'm here on behalf of Renewed Hope and also as a member of East Bay housing organizations. And as you may know, since Alameda is a member of EB HOA, that it is an organization with 400 members, individuals and organizations devoted to creating affordable housing. Through advocacy. Advocacy, education and coalition building. Thank you for recognizing affordable housing week two years ago, Renewed Hope was honored during this very same week by EB HOA for our years of advocacy work and for pushing, which included pushing for the passage of the city's housing element, which of course brought Alameda into compliance with state law. But the really important fact was that what really the idea that Alameda finally embraced the idea that we needed to build housing for everybody, not just for the, you know, the top 11% who can actually afford a market rate home. I think that symbolized Alameda is Elam's acceptance of that concept. And that was really the important thing that. Happened with with our work. And in 2013. The theme for Affordable Housing Week, as you as this was stated, is here to stay building inclusive communities. It addresses the urgency of the current moment in the Bay Area, not just in Alameda, of course, where we see people with roots who belong here as much as anybody not able to stay, even though they may have a family, a job, children in school, a whole history. And in Alameda, the idea of roots and longevity is a source of pride. Yet the wealth that's been brought by the computer industry is not all encompassing. It's very selective. And it tends to threaten. The character of to undermine local character. Unless we push for policies that ensure that this wealth also generates public benefits, including affordable housing. I am heartened by the strong support of this Council. I hope we can all work together to build affordable housing without having to rely exclusively on market rate housing. But to replace redevelopment, we really have to work at the state level. There are two bills AB 35 and AB 1335. That we would encourage you to support in the form. Of rebel solutions. I understand the real estate industry is behind them this time. Thank you. I'm speaking with regard to the Alameda home team. We also our members with of. IMHO and we look forward to. Having our second celebration of that at a panel discussion. On May the 15th. Which will start at. 130 in the afternoon. And we're looking forward to having a thorough discussion. Of the elements it really takes to make a community, a community where we talk about housing and jobs in terms not of competing interests. But in interests that complement each other. And we'll have a special invitation for each of you, for anyone that wants to sign up for the attend the panel. And we have a sign up sheet outside. And we look forward to seeing a lot of you to celebrate. Almeida's commitment to housing. For all. Incomes. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, counsel. My name is Neil Saxby. I work for Eaton Housing, which has been building and managing quality, affordable housing around the Bay Area for 45 years. One of the oldest nonprofit housing developers. I'm also a resident of Alameda, but my accent gives me away. I've been living here for ten years. I just wanted to thank you for this proclamation. We've been selected as part of the Alameda Point Partners team and will be the affordable developer at the point. I've been building affordable housing for. Eight years and never. Has it been so difficult to build a new affordable units at a very low and low level. And therefore, we really grateful and and thank you to the Council for supporting efforts at Alameda Point, which will go a long way to building new units. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Risi.

Item 23 Report from Public Works Recommendation to authorize City Manager to execute an employee with the Harbor Department to implement the Colorado Lagoon Open Channel Restoration Phase two A Project Execute a bank enabling instrument to finance the project and sell the established mitigation credits and execute an amendment to contract with anchor UEA to increase the contract amount by 2.8 million. District two three I'm sorry. I'm going to ask for a short staff report. This is a significant item and a great step forward, so. Mr. MODICA. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. We did originally have a presentation plan, but we will skip the presentation but give you a very short staff report. This is incredibly significant. The Colorado Lagoon has really been one of those municipal miracles and transformation over the last 15, 20 years. What started in 2000 as basically a storm drain project and we had a neighborhood up in arms about, you know, using the lagoon as only a storm drain really prompted a way that we rethink what that lagoon is for. Here we are now, and 2019, it's been about $21 million later in all grant funds or very little amount of Thailand's funds. And we are seeing A-plus water quality in the lagoon, but it's time to take the next step. So what we've been working on for the past probably six, seven years is creating the very first wetlands mitigation bank where we are using title or we're using harbor funds from the Port of Long Beach. So not taxpayer dollars to invest into the open channel and actually do ecosystem restoration with lots of different habitat. And we have a and fantastic partner in the Port of Long Beach and we have just unbelievably community, community support who have been with us every step of the way. So I can't thank the team enough that's been working on this. This is probably one of our more and most complex from a technical level and getting that bank enabling instrument approved, getting the Coastal Commission approval. I want to thank the mayor and Susie Price, the councilmember price for being there every step of the way in making this a priority and of course, the harbor for paying the 26 million. And we are just beyond excited to get this project going forward. And thanks again to Eric Lopez and Josh Hickman and the rest of the team. Thank you. And let me first go to Councilman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to Mr. Modica and of course, the public works team via Tidelands that's been working on this project, Eric Lopez, for a very, very long time. And Joshua Heckman they've just been fantastic. So I think everyone received this CD. Did everyone receive the city? Okay. So I didn't know what a mitigation bank was when I became a council member. And one of the first things I did within a month of being on the council within a couple of months, is I requested through Tom Modica at the time to meet with somebody who could educate me on what a mitigation bank was. And it was such an educational experience. I can't even begin to tell you it's so difficult to create a mitigation bank. And this is the first coastal mitigation bank in the state of California. Yes, we've talked about the port of Long Beach giving the project money. But in reality, what the Port of Long Beach is doing is purchasing mitigation credits within the region. And Councilmember Ranga, thank you so much for your support on this. Through everything, I mean we serve on LC together, but also Coastal Commission was a big supporter of this project and you understand that and this is the simplest way I like to describe it to my residents is one when an entity does something that's invasive to the environment, they have to mitigate and rehab another part of the environment within the region. And so that's how they can purchase mitigation credits. I mean, that's a very simplistic way of saying it. But the mitigation credits that are being purchased in the Colorado Lagoon by the Port of Long Beach are being purchased under the new standards that are set up for mitigation banks. It's it's actually such an interesting project from so many different levels because we're setting the standard for mitigation banks in the future for for anyone that's going to be purchasing mitigation banks in terms of how the standard and expectations are. So it's a really big project. It's a win win project because the Port of Long Beach gets to purchase its mitigation credits right here in the city of Long Beach for a project that's huge. The Colorado Lagoon water quality was enhanced tremendously when we planted the eelgrass and that was a great project. But in order for us to have sustained long term good water quality, we need to have more water flow in that body of water and this is going to allow us to do so. This is not a project. The community is very supportive about this project and I know we have someone from the community here and I want to thank the friends of the Colorado Lagoon for being tremendous partners, even way before I came on council making this project happen. But this is not one of those projects where, you know, there is going to be a lot of bells and whistles for the community. We're not talking about playgrounds and, you know, recreational areas. This is an environmental project that's designed to enhance water quality. That's all this is. But it's a very costly project because it's going to require a lot of changes in infrastructure and long term water quality. People will hopefully be able to swim in this body of water like they did in the twenties and the thirties when the Colorado Lagoon was at its best. And so I want to thank all the partners. And Tom, you've been an exceptional partner in this project again, way before I got on the council. And Eric, you've just done a lot to I probably butchered a lot of the technicalities here, but you've done a lot to teach me along the way in simplicity what a mitigation bank is and how it is that we're able to work with our partners to enhance spaces such as this, and of course, in the areas of the wetlands where we do a lot of work. So I want to thank everyone and of course, the Port of Long Beach for being a partner and choosing to invest in this project. Thank you. So our accountant prepares. Thank you. I just wanted to lend my support to this item when it came up. When I first learned about it, I talked to staff, I've talked to the port. I think they're doing this mitigation bank is amazing for Long Beach. It's amazing for the state of California. And I know that staff, Long Beach staff in particular works very well with the Coastal Commission. I know through the years it has always been a kind of a shift and so I appreciate you guys doing that work and I appreciate the port not only for investing in this project, but their investment in CD two and CD one and many other places. So thank you. Embry. Ringo. Thank you, Mary. And I feel honored and proud that I had two touches on this project. One here, of course, with the city and one with the coast commission. And I want to give staff kudos for that great presentation they made before the Coastal Commission to have it passed unanimously. 12 zero So kudos to the staff to to the Port of Long Beach and of course to my fellow council members in the second and the first for putting this forward. Thank you. And I want to also just thank our staff at that. You guys have done just a phenomenal job on this project. And I think for for many of us, we've been following the work on the ground for for a very long time. And it's been it's gone through many iterations of council members and mayors and staff work, and it's always moved forward. And now we're at a point where there is a significant opportunity for really large investment from the harbor department and councilmember prices. Exactly right. This the mitigation of the mitigation proposal, as it was envisioned, just took a lot of work to put together. And I think you and our partners did a great job of moving that forward. And obviously, there you know, there have been changes in the way in what Sacramento allows us to do and others that that create these different opportunities. And so I want to I just want to thank everyone for being involved. And this is going to be a fantastic project when it's done. I want to call up Heather Altman, who has been here. I mean, amazing. You're you're here still. But it shows you're you've been committed to this project for a long time. Crossed the Rubicon about 10:00. I couldn't leave. Heather Altman, vice president of Friends of Colorado Lagoon, here to speak in strong support of this item. Thank staff Eric Lopez Josh whose gone missing who left Mayor Garcia for your leadership Councilmember Urunga your yes vote to touches thank you good ones for both and Councilwoman Susie Price, you campaigned . On having this be a priority project. And it's such a thrill to see you just pick up the ball and run with it. And here we are. It was such an infeasible thing that we thought was going to happen. I remember when I was sitting at a board meeting when the open channel was revealed and I thought, You people are insane if you think you're going to get this permitted and funded and here we are. So again, just very supportive of this. Can't wait for this to move forward and looking forward to the next step and continuing this partnership. Thank you. Great. Thank you very much. And with that members, please go and cast your votes. Bush and Kerry.","Recommendation to authorize City Manager, or designee, to execute a Memorandum of Understanding, and any other necessary documents, with the Harbor Department, to implement the Colorado Lagoon Open Channel Restoration Phase 2A Project (Project); Authorize City Manager, or designee, to execute a Bank Enabling Instrument, and any other necessary documents, with the State and Federal Resource Agencies, to create a mitigation bank at the Colorado Lagoon to finance the Project and sell the established mitigation credits; Authorize City Manager, or designee, to execute an amendment to Contract No. 34377, and any subsequent amendments, with Anchor QEA, LLC, of Huntington Beach, CA, to increase the contract amount by $2,800,000, for a revised total contract amount not to exceed $3,100,000, and extend the term to January 1, 2024; and Increase appropriations in the Tidelands Operating Fund Group in the Public Works Department by $26,300,000, offset by a transfer from the Harbor Department.

So as I said earlier and during the committee, the decision in front of the council's day, which is described in Council Bill 118793, relates to us enforcing a law that we did pass ordinance 124968 which basically set up a collective bargaining process for the drivers, whether you driver a taxi or for hire or TNC or Uber or Lyft in any of those cars, a process by which you can organize or a process by which you could reject organization.

And as you may recall, the ordinance one two, 4968 did require that the department develop these rules. And you heard today, I think, testimony on opinions on the rules. And so what we're asking FAA has to do is to continue to have a dialog with all of these people, some of their their representatives, to come up with the rules that seem to make sense. We realize this is a very difficult task. There are going to be several opinions on who should be able to vote, what a qualified driver representative could be, what an exclusive driver representative could be, and the rules associated with that whole system of of a bargaining process. And and that's what we're doing in a setting up the deadline. So the new deadline in this legislation will be January 17th, which is after budget and after the well, not after the cold weather, that's for sure, will probably be a little chilly. But I'll give the FAA the option, do a lot of outreach meeting with you and we may contemplate another public hearing or not. That decision has not been made, but they will do the outreach and come up with the rules. Originally during committee we thought we might be able to accomplish that by November 18th, but the FAA has made it clear that they need the additional time to do the outreach they think is necessary. So that's all this legislation does, is set that deadline up until January 17th to come up with the rules that so many people are interested in. So are there any questions from any of my colleagues. Thank you. That I can't remember. Thank you. Have a quick question. What is the status of part time workers being able to be part of the conversation for voting? Is that something FAA has to decide to take on, or is that something that we as a council can recommend? So you can recommend at any given point what you believe the status of a qualified driver should be. But the part time drivers, whether they're doing one trip, one a week or working 6 hours a week, have has the same say so in voice in the process as a full time driver, a person working 40 or 50 hours a week. So there's been no arbitrary decisions on who has a voice during the stakeholder process. At the end of the process, there will be rules formed that will decide who gets to vote, who's a qualified driver to vote on whether the union process continues. But at this point, all voices are being heard and no one is being excluded. So do they have it as far as has not have an opportunity at the end of the process to make a decision on whether the drivers have to be full time, where they could get part time or they get a part time vote. Mean for example, what I'm hearing from the green shirts over here is that those who are not driving full time would like to have at least a percentage vote. So if they're working 2035. Sorry, I misunderstood what you were hearing. I heard from others saying that if they were driving at least some some percentage of the full time. Or part time when it's an independent. Contractor. So I'm sorry, but I'm an equal opportunity president. So if I hear more disruption, I'm going to ask that you be removed. And if you don't voluntarily be removed, I will have you removed. We've already received public comment. We're discussing this among ourselves. I know you're passionate about this. I understand that we are not making that decision right now. Sally Bagshaw As to who I think what I'm trying to say and maybe I'll make this crystal clear. A part time driver, a full time driver. All will be talked to during the process by which will define who gets to vote. And these folks can vote thumbs up or thumbs down on the union process. And what we're with the difficulty right now and the qualified driver issue is as a qualified driver, a person drives one hour a week or one trip a week. I drive, I vote, or some people do this full time, 40 or 50 hours a week, or should they be the ones? And so very emotional decision. But we're asking for us to make that decision through the rules. And they're going to listen to everybody and they're going to have again, they're going to have outreach meetings. They're going to take surveys. They're trying to get data as to how many trips are made. That's the process that will be completed by January 17th. Okay. Any other comments from any of my colleagues? Okay. With that, please call the role on the passage of the Bill. Herbold II Johnson IV. Whereas I O'Brien. II. So want I beg Sean Burgess I. Gonzalez All right. President Harrell All right. Nine in favor.

- The council is establishing a new deadline of January 17th for the Finance and Administrative Services department (FAS) to develop rules defining who qualifies as a ""driver representative"" that can vote on potential unionization for ride-share and taxi drivers.

- This extends the previous deadline of September 19th, as FAS needs more time for outreach and getting complete data on drivers' working hours/patterns. 

- A major unresolved issue is whether to allow part-time drivers an equal vote as full-time drivers in any unionization process.

- FAS will continue stakeholder meetings and surveys to get input from drivers on what criteria should define a ""qualified driver representative"" before finalizing the rules.

- The extended deadline allows FAS more time for this contentious process of determining voting eligibility rules, as different drivers have conflicting viewpoints.

- After public comments, the council voted 9-0 to pass the ordinance establishing the new January 17th deadline for FAS to propose the finalized driver qualification rules.

The central objective is giving FAS adequate time to properly engage drivers and thoroughly vet criteria for who can participate in any potential unionization vote, given the complexity and disagreement around defining ""qualified drivers.""",0.7350000000000001,"Approach each presentation from a perspective of thorough understanding through free-form reasoning.

So Councilmember de. So you, I believe, pulled this item, too. Yes. Thank you. I'll just say quickly, two weeks ago, when we first discussed this item, I indicated that I'd have to mull over it even more. And having done so, I want to first say from the outset, I appreciate the modifications that the city attorney's office had done with regard to partial housing units that are accessory dwelling units. Making that effort in light of how that aligns with or not. Chapter 26 of our City Charter, known as Measure A of 1973 or Measure A of 1990. So I appreciate that change, but I still have a larger concern having thought about it over the past two weeks. I still have a larger concern because I do believe the city of Alameda as a charter city, which means that it can create its own rules. As a charter city, I think there are still some issues that that that we can put forward. And as we have done so with Measure a, um, I, I get staff's reasoning that the state law in many respects supersedes local law, but I'm not altogether convinced that that's the case in the charter city situations. But I recognize that, you know, staff, counsel and perhaps the public might think otherwise. But for that reason I've decided that I will vote no on five f. Thank you, councilmember de. So do I have a motion approving of item five F move approval? Second, it's a move by the vice mayor, seconded by Councilmember o.T. A roll call vote, please. Councilmember de SAG. No. Not quite. I Odie. I Vela. I may or as he Ashcraft. I. That carries by five eyes. All right so now we have can experience 441. Um, now. Yeah, we've finished the consent calendar. Have we been able to get Miss Butler on to the. Into the meeting? No. Now, she was on via phone before and now it's saying she's locked out. So it's not locked out. But I if it's okay with the council, I will try to pinch hit for her. I have her data and there and we can take the. Okay, bear with us one moment, Miss Potter, because I believe we have to recess this meeting again. But I believe I have I'm just clairvoyant. And I think I've got a motion from the vice mayor that we recess in a second by Councilmember Vella. Correct? Correct. A right. Yes. All right. Roll call vote, please. Councilmember Odie, did you have a question? I just wonder if we might consider combining mind A with this since they're kind of on the same topic. Or is nine name my council referral? Yes. I think that's a good idea. I said, can we do that? No, no. My apologies for my muting the. Troublemakers. Because these are two separate meetings. I don't recommend all combine items across meetings. Okay. That's right. But I'll tell you what, after. No, that was a reasonable suggestion. After we hear this next item on the special meeting, perhaps it will answer some of the questions that we had on from 9 a.m. So with that, we've had the motion. We had the second. We didn't vote yet, did we? On this? We do. Okay. Let's do that. Councilmember de san. Yes. Not quite. Hi. Yeah. Bella. I may. Or as the Ashcroft. Yes. Okay. That carries by five s. All right.

But again, that discussion we had this morning about small businesses and in particular immigrant refugee businesses or minority owned businesses, that part of what we're doing, we are recognizing that there's a need for technical assistance. I continue to believe that lending and access to capital will be a huge charge of ours. So I would want us to look at latter part of this year during the budget process and next year, whether it's access to capital, which seems which should probably drive a lot of our decision making. That continues to be a concern. We hear it over and over. I'm sure there's a need for technical assistance as well, but I think we need to really put a little pressure on the department to to better understand what's happening out there at these small businesses and what, in fact, their needs are. Since we did identify a need, one of the issues was that we didn't get enough money out of the door. Let's find out what's happening there. But certainly I support this legislation. Thank you.

Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record. Conclude the public hearing and adopt a resolution approving the 2013 to 2021 housing element as a part of the city's general plan and authorize it submittal to the State Department of Housing and Community Development and authorize the Director of Building and Services to submit the adopted housing element to the California Coastal Commission for finding of conformance with the Certified Local Coastal Program and certify the negative NEG negative declaration in d0313. This work? Yes, Mayor. Members of the Council. This process has been underway for about a year with multiple hearings before the Planning Commission and Amy Bodak will provide the staff report on this particular item. There have been a number of changes and revisions to the document since it was first released, and that's the result of a lot of public input. The OECD and the various entities that weigh in on these kinds of actions. So we're very pleased to present you a housing element that, in fact has been approved by the state. And Amy Bodak will go through the details and the process. Mr. Mayor. Members of the City Council, thank you for your time tonight. Related to the housing element, some of which you will see tonight, is a recap of where we were in December. However, I am going to present to you some changes since December that have been made to the housing element and talk to you in general about the process and clearly the need for the housing element. As you probably recall, the housing element is one of seven mandated elements within the state of California. It requires a review by the State Department of Housing and Community Development that a review process is required to occur before the City Council takes action to adopt a housing element. The state law does require periodic updates to the housing element. This is slightly different from other general plan updates, but we are in the process of updating our housing element for the fifth cycle, which would be for the period of time from 2013 to 2021. Part of the housing element certification process is getting a finding of substantial compliance from the State Department of Housing and Community Development. This is an important tool for us to achieve which we have achieved. Part of that because it provides us with a legally adequate general plan and it provides a presumption of validity of the housing element in the event that we are sued. We also must have a housing element that is in compliance with state law in order to go after certain grants and certain funding programs. So it is critical for us as a city to have a housing element that is certified by the state. Additionally, if we do have a certified housing element by the statutory deadline, it does allow us to get on an eight year cycle for the housing element. UPDATE A large component of the housing element is built upon this concept of RINA numbers, which is your regional housing needs assessment, that that number is determined basically by the state handed down to the the local council of government in this case. Skog There are regional government entity and then they divide up the regional housing need into the various jurisdictional needs and then assigns those needs to the various cities. State law requires that we provide in the housing element evidence that we can meet our arena numbers from a production standpoint, but it only allow requires us to demonstrate that we have adequate zoning in place to do so. Our arena numbers are a planning tool. It is not a production tool or a production requirement of the of the city. So you can see that Long Beach has a arena allocation for this next period of of over 7000 units. This allocation, as I had said, is determined through a formula by the state handed down to the regional government entity. But in this case, Long Beach does share carry a disproportionate amount of the area's regional needs. That is something that we cannot change right now. But we do carry a disproportional number amount of of the area's need. We got assigned a larger burden than other surrounding cities by SAG. This chart shows you that in the previous housing element cycle, our required planning allocation was about 9500 units. That has been reduced because essentially a result of the economy and the stagnation of economic growth. So our new arena number is 7048. It is divided into categories, income categories. You will see that we are as a whole being asked to provide or allow for the opportunity for these 7048 units to be developed in. The majority of that is in the above moderate category. We have, as assistant manager Frick mentioned, gone through some extensive consultation with various community groups and stakeholders, the State and the Planning Commission, and this reflects some of that outreach. We have been meeting with the Planning Commission. We've had a series of three citywide community meetings and we've had individual and group consultations with various stakeholders as a result of that. The key issues that were raised in the housing element was a lack of quality existing housing in the region. Overcrowding clearly was an issue, a general lack of affordability along all income lines. The fact that that homelessness continues to be an issue for us, that there are few ADA accessible units within the city that are affordable and the need to disperse affordable housing throughout the city and not just in the downtown. We submitted a draft of our housing element as written by staff and by our consultant to the state. And the State provided their initial review and initial comments in August of 2013. This was very, very important to us because the state's initial review told us exactly where they wanted us to focus our energies and where they wanted us to revise the housing element to be more consistent with state law. The first issue that they asked us to look at was a program that we had in there related to the first right of refusal for displaced lower income households. They asked for us to consider expanding the zoning code to allow for additional areas within the city that we would allow emergency shelters to occur as of right. They asked us to focus on transit oriented development opportunities, particularly along the Blue Lane corridor. And then they talked about setting aside general fund revenues for the conduct of affordable housing in the future. So he came up with a number of programs, and I'm going to go through a list of what's in the housing element. And you can see from these charts what our existing programs that we're carrying forward and then the new programs that we are proposing in this housing element, you will see that we have taken a number of steps to introduce new concepts and new programs to address our existing needs and have expanded greatly upon the last housing element cycle. So we do consider a new program for the first right of refusal for displaced lower income households. This is something that came out of the downtown plan a couple of years ago. We clearly focus on the continuum of care related to our homeless and needy population. We did include a program to expand the areas within the city where we would consider as of right winter excuse me, as of right emergency shelters. And then we listed the number of existing programs that we have for residents with special needs. Additionally, we have some new programs that were not in the housing element but that we might already have had experience with and added those to the housing element as further commitment to our programs for special needs residents. This includes our Vash program, which is a program run through our housing authority, which is our Veterans Affairs, supportive housing vouchers. So they are basically Section eight vouchers that are specifically geared for for veterans. And then a program to help us focus on the continuum of care, permanent supportive housing, which is very important to us in transitioning the homeless population into permanent housing. And then also programs where we address projects that need additional assistance through specifically allocating Section eight vouchers in a project based mechanism to specific projects. And that's how we have been able to assist, for example, the expansion of the villages at Cambria. We have a number of programs, both new and existing, related to housing and neighborhood improvement, including additional home rehabilitation programs that we're considering, comprehensive code enforcement, neighborhood improvement services. And as you know, the foreclosure registry is a new program that was not previously considered in the housing element. And we are making a commitment to continuing that program in this housing element cycle. Additionally, as it relates to housing production, we are looking at two new programs along the lines of adaptive reuse and then additional money for the housing trust fund, or frankly, not just the housing trust fund, but the housing fund in general. Lastly, we are looking at opportunities to increase homeownership opportunities and clearly programs for mitigating government constraints that may exist to the development of affordable housing. Monitoring and review we are committing, which is of course, a requirement of state law, but we're putting it in the housing element that we're committing to annual reporting of the housing element. So these this slide represents those additional programs that we have added to the housing element specifically to address either public stakeholder comments or state comments. And these programs as a as a iterated earlier was the first drive refusal for displaced lower income households, exploring the additional zoning categories for emergency shelters by right, focusing the use of home funds, which are federal funds along the PD 29 Long Beach Boulevard corridor in the downtown area, and then exploring the feasibility of some programs related to habitability of existing units. Again, these are new programs that we're proposing specifically to address stakeholder concerns. Priority of funding near transit was a was a big issue that the state wanted us to talk about in expanding housing opportunities throughout the city as it relates to future updates of our zoning code. And then, as I had said earlier, identifying additional funds not just for the housing trust fund but for the the entire and the entirety of the affordable housing fund. We are specifically going to be looking at financial incentives for transit oriented development, particularly along the Long Beach Boulevard corridor. This includes the preparation of a housing action plan, specifically addressing transit oriented development and how we would be trying to offer incentives. Our housing action plan would also include a plan for how we intend to redevelop the property that is owned by the former housing development company. So in terms of housing resources, we do have a number of resources that are available today. This represents to you the fiscal 13 budget that was put that is available for affordable housing purposes. Clearly, the largest line item is the housing authority and their combination of their vouchers that they have for veterans housing for people with AIDS, Section eight vouchers, and then their project project based Section eight vouchers as well. However, the Housing Successor Agency still maintains a balance, and they have about $14 million available. That was in the budget for fiscal year 13. We had about $18 million in housing bonds that were not returned to the state that are available for the development of housing. And then we have a number of of different sources through either the state or the federal government with home and CDBG. Right now, as of today. I have about $16.8 million available in the housing fund. In addition, we do have a significant opportunities that are arising in the future for us to repay some housing debt that would allow us to generate approximately additional $24 million in housing funds over the next five plus years or so. In terms of the amount of existing affordable units within the city, this does include those vouchers that are offered through the housing authority through Section eight. But we in in total have approximately 13,000 units citywide that are currently restricted for affordable housing. We do believe that there are more units than this that are considered affordable or or who have people living in them who are of affordable income. But these are the ones that are deed restricted or otherwise controlled and monitored by the city for the purposes of affordable housing. So since you last got an update in your study session in December, there have been a number of changes made to the housing element. This includes additionally additional revisions to the emergency shelter rezoning. One of the stakeholder groups had initially requested that we consider four different zones for expanding the ability to do emergency shelters. That stakeholder group has since revised their position to reduce the number of zones from four to do to two. So we have subsequently reduced the zones to PD 29, which is Long Beach Boulevard and the Eye Zone, which is light industrial. So we are committing in the housing element to a program that would have us look at those zones, do an analysis, study that, and then also comply with secure and bring forth some amendments to the zoning code that would potentially rezone portions or all of these zones for the availability of emergency shelters. We've also revised program 3.3 since early December, and we worked very closely with the State Housing, Development, Housing and Community Development Department to rewrite this language, to consider habitability issues related to units within the city. So there are other programs that are available in other cities and other jurisdictions that we would look to. We are not limiting ourselves to just one specific program, but are instead committing to address habitability issues if there are issues out there. But we would first commit to studying those issues and then addressing them as needed. Program 4.1 relates to housing development. Again, we worked very closely with the State Department of Housing and Community Development to rewrite language regarding the preparation of this housing action plan. And this is specifically targeting transit rich neighborhoods. HQ is very, very focused on us providing opportunities along transit corridors and urging us in our housing action plan to deal with with the transit oriented corridors. Conveniently, the property that the former housing development company owns. Is along transit oriented corridors. And so we will be wrapping the re-use of that property into the Housing Action Plan. Program 4.4 was significantly rewritten with CD, where we committed to new language regarding the investigation of funds for affordable housing. This is a major departure from where we were a few months ago, and it does provide language that talks about the repayment of over $24 million in debt that is owed the housing fund. You yourself, as the successor agency, already took action to commit the repayment of $16 million to the housing fund when you approved a repayment schedule back in October as the successor agency. We will be coming to you in the future with additional amortization schedules to allow you to ask for your consideration in in reestablishing additional debt. This would be in addition to the $16 million that are currently in the housing fund right now as a result of all of this effort . The state did issue a letter dated December 27th, which is in your packet that stated that the city's housing element as drafted is in compliance with state law. So we do believe that we have been very responsive and pushed the envelope quite a bit from where we were as a city from the old housing element to the proposed housing element that is before you for your consideration as part of that. I would be remiss if I did not mention that we did have to do a negative declaration. And you are being asked to certify that negative declaration as part of your adoption of the housing element. Should you proceed to move forward with this, we would make any technical revisions to the housing element and then submit it to the state. The state still has to go through an additional review where they they ensure that we are still remain in compliance based on any changes that you might make tonight. And then they have 90 days to provide us with the fully certified letter that we do have a fully certified housing element. So if we are proceeding tonight, we would hope that we would have a fully certified housing element by May of this year and that we would then be able to proceed with implementing the programs that we have put forth in the housing element for your consideration. That concludes our staff report. I do have Jeff Winkel Clark, the acting planning administrator, here to help answer any questions. And then we have Bill Tremble from our consulting firm, Veronica Hammond Associates here as well to answer any questions you might have. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. Burdick, any questions at this time? Well, Mr. Austin, we're going to take public testimony. But I just have a quick, quick question regarding the the $16 million that was approved in October and the $16 million that you say we have currently in the fund? Yes, sir. What funds are those? So the city has all of the money is committed, I should say. Most of the money is committed towards affordable housing, sit in an affordable housing fund, and that that fund cannot be co-mingled. There are a number of revenues that flow into that fund, including bond proceeds in lieu fees from condo conversions. Some of our home dollars that we get from the federal government are funneled into this fund as well. But as of today, we have $16.8 million in our affordable housing fund. It is not accessible to the general fund. It is not it cannot be used for any other purpose but rehab or production of affordable housing. Separately, you as a successor agency took action to reestablish some debt that was owed to the housing fund. That coincidentally is also in the amount of about 16 million. I think it's $16.3 million. I believe you took that action sometime in October or November as a successor agency and you did commit to reestablishing that debt as the city receives property tax revenue through the the the flow of of tax dollars. That money will get repaid. Thank you very much. And thank you for the very thorough staff report. I want to commend the staff for all of their hard work on this. This is a very complicated document. I know it's taken many, many hours. I commend you for the community outreach and I want to commend the community for their participation in it. Obviously, they have had some impact on the this document in terms of, you know, the ideas that that and input that you received from the community out there. And I know there's more, but I think it's a great start. So congratulations on on a great element. Okay. Public testimony. Those who tend to give testimony on this, please come forward. Identify yourself. I could get an idea how many people would like to speak. That'd be great. Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. My name's Gary Shelton. The address is 240 Chestnut Avenue. And good evening, council and members of staff. I wanted to just start by saying I'm here to represent the Long Beach Area Coalition for the Homeless as it advocacy chair. You might know I've served on other boards. I'm zeroing in my comments tonight in relation to what the Miami Area Coalition for the Homeless has authorized me to do. And but I also want to acknowledge the hard work of housing Long Beach and also of Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. I stand firmly behind them personally with the presentation that they may be prepared to make to you this evening regarding their comments and thought. I wanted to also mention that we heard earlier a few minutes ago that tonight what you the action you take will create what is basically a finding of substantial compliance with with state law . And I think that's correct. And I think it's well and good. Been working for well since phase since the fourth cycle began since before it began to achieve the compliance that I believe on the narrow issue that I'm speaking about tonight has been achieved and that's program to point to the emergency shelter rezoning. I'm very pleased to see that the Planning Commission decided that it would put a end date on when that would happen, and that staff has incorporated that in the report tonight. And I think that that that's going to work. I'm reminded of something that Kerry Gallagher, who's the the you know, a good friend of mine mentioned to me a couple of days ago. She said one thing that we can urge you to do and you might hear this later on this evening, is is to realize that compliance with the law shouldn't be the bottom line, but rather meaningful action and related to emergency shelter by sight. Meaningful action is what it's all going to be about. There is not enough emergency shelter existing in the city right now, so to speak. For just a moment about the arena numbers related to extremely low income goals of 1773 units, I'd want to point out that based on the past performance of the city in its ability to create extremely low income affordability for housing, that goal of 773 units or that need of 1773 units would be achieved in something along the line of 933 years from now. Our performance has been dismally slow. However, however, state funding of affordable housing you know, the housing trust fund, the housing fund that Amy spoke about is extremely important for us to move forward into the next year to get that accomplished. So what I want to specifically support is program 2.2, the emergency shelter rezoning. And I also personally support the point of view of housing. Long Beach. Thank you very much. Thank you. The you have 3 minutes. When you see the yellow light, that means you have 30 seconds left. And I would urge you, please don't be repetitive. We have a lot of people who and I'm going to try to give you all 3 minutes. But if it's going to take a long time, we'll have to reduce that. So try to be economical with your time. Please identify yourself. My name is Diane McNabb. Live at 908 North Park Circle. West Division beat six across from Greg Park in the historic Fillmore District. I have lived in Long Beach since 1976. A little background. I've served as Community Development Commissioner, Board Ambassador, elected to the Community College Board of Trustees, and according to the Housing Element charts, I am designated as low income, so my remarks might come as a surprise. My neighborhood is very challenged with the density of a third world country and only 10% owner occupancy. We think gentrification and market rate housing is a good thing. It creates stable neighborhoods and additional stakeholders. The housing element should be a excuse me adopted as it stands without further inclusion of anything else. City staff has worked extremely hard with all stakeholders. And the careful analysis reveals a very carefully balanced plan. It's the result of hard work. A vibrant, caring professionals who have taken all aspects of the Long Beach economy into consideration. Thank you very much. Next, please. Names. Larry Good. Hugh Kirk as the address. Kirk as my address, I noted the speaker. The previous speaker, as of last as she did last week, indicated that according to the stats, she is considered low income. But I think we all agree she certainly has million dollar looks. Thank you very much. As stated before, my position is that the where one lives, with exception of veterans and severely disabled and those are in temporary need of emergency. Housing is not the business of the city. Where the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker is a no lives is no concern to the city. You know, there's a old paradigm that in the sports world or athletic world, if you want to get better, you play with people that are better than you got the same level of you seem to it the same thing with academics. If you want to learn, you learn and you work and you interface with people that are smarter than you. I think what we should do is that I agree with the previous speaker. Don't touch the existing plan. But in the future I think what we should do is turn to a like cities like Beverly Hills, Irvine and Newport. Find out what they do. It may require a change in paradigm, a dramatic change in paradigm, but I think that's something we should work on. Again, take care of the veterans, take care of our legals seniors, and take care of those who are temporarily in need of temporary housing. But beyond that, we're that butcher where that baker, where that candlestick maker lives is not a concern of any city. Thank you. Thank you. Next, please. Evening, Mayor. City Council staff. My name's Jeremy Harris. I'm the senior vice president for Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. Keep my points brief tonight. Here to speak on behalf of the Chamber and our support of the agenda item 2013 2021 housing element as part of the city's general plan and move the document forward to the necessary agencies as outlined in the presentation. Chamber believes the housing element, as written will allow Long Beach to compete for high quality housing developments and remain economically competitive in the neighboring cities when investors come looking. Furthermore, the Chamber agrees with other organizations such as the downtown Long Beach Association, that by allowing any inclusionary housing policies into the current housing element, this would lead to an otherwise worrisome policy impacting a majority of the potential new development, especially in the downtown area. We believe the housing element provides sound policy and guidance for current and future Long Beach residents. We commend the staff, their outreach efforts, their multiple transactions with stakeholders on both sides of this very important issue and document. We know this process was extensive, as thoroughly been research by city staff with multiple revisions as we heard during their presentation. Based on this work, and, as we already know, a letter of compliance from the California Department of Housing and Community Development as accepted the current version of the housing element, any and all policy efforts would serve to better positioned Long Beach for the future. By improving the current and future. Housing is something the Chamber strongly endorses. Long Beach is exceedingly fortunate to have a dynamic port, an airport, excellent public transportation, direct service, by the way of multiple freeways, roadways and pathways that connect Long Beach to the region and beyond. Now we have a document that concludes a road map for a housing. Thank you for your time tonight. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Evening, Mayor. Councilmember. Staff. I'll be very brief. My name is Joshua Holston with Urban Village. We have a project on Long Beach Boulevard in 10th for 216,000 square foot, a mixed use project encompassing both residential and retail. And I got to say, we have absolutely loved working with the city of Long Beach. We were able to get our project approved and in short order because of the fact that it was a very collaborative setting and we were loved working as far as was staff to be able to get our project through. A lot of people didn't think we were going to break ground. We did. And there was a very challenging prospect as far as putting the funds together. The reason why I give this back story is this the way that the housing element is written as of now we think is very solid. Is it is it doesn't scare off groups like ours from coming in and taking on new projects. If, for example, inclusionary housing was added to this in in addition to what is currently there, it has a couple of effects. The first in our project, if anything was added on top, we would not have been able to make it work as it was. We are stretched to be able to hit that yield with the increase from the time we started construction of construction costs. It even makes it more challenging to take on projects that have on market rate projects to have an affordable component. But the other thing it does, besides just. Reducing the amount of. Projects that get approved or able to get financing to move through, is it also actually passes the burden down to the rest of the folks that are renting units or purchasing units because of the fact of the additional burden of cost. When you do build, as you council members know, when you do build the affordable housing project or even a project that has an affordable component, then you have to pay prevailing wages. Now, regardless of where you stand on this, it still does increase the project cost by between 20 to 30%. And what that does is we have to into passing that down to the residents of the market rate units, which ends up costing more. So in essence, it creates. Almost an additional. Burden and less affordable units or less affordability for the market rate units. So with that said, I really appreciate your time and we definitely support the housing element as it currently stands. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi, Mr. Vice Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Ehud, mostly. I'm a developer and consultant on affordable middle income workforce housing. I also chair the housing initiative of the L.A. District Council over the July, and I serve on the adjunct faculty of the MBA program at USC. As I told your study group on December ten, I believe the City Council should adopt the solid and thoughtful draft housing element with its emphasis on affordable housing. Affordable housing with a capital A has become a politically correct term, referring to housing for extremely low, very low and low income families. Those with incomes below the 80% of. Area median income. However, a highly pressing issue of housing unaffordable unaffordability with a small a in Long Beach is made abundantly clear on pages 4042 of the housing element. As a responsible and compassionate society, we must continue to take care of housing needs of families who earn less than 80% of them. I would do that with existing and new federal, state and municipal subsidies and other specifically targeted programs. But we cannot continue to neglect housing needs of middle income families who earn more than 80% of the economy. These families form the backbone of the community. They drive economic development. They constitute the bulk of first responders. Sadly, these middle income families have been orphaned by the system. They are not eligible for housing support mechanisms available to those who are less fortunate financially. It is an illusion that the Great Recession has increased permanent affordability. Coastal California housing is unaffordable to most middle income workforce workforce families. We still have a location mismatch between affordable housing and jobs. This is a roadblock to employee attraction, retention, economic development and community building. A recent Wells Fargo survey showed that when it came to unaffordability, the L.A. Long Beach Metro ranked number four out of 222 in the country and number three out of 28 in California. This is hardly an achievement to be proud of. The housing element contains another painful statistic the 437,000 median price house in Long Beach requires a qualifying income of $109,000. This is 168% of the amount. Thus, a family with Amy over $65,000 can afford the house price of no more than 260,000. According to Zillow, only 17% of the 1900 houses for sale in Long Beach are priced below $260,000. Similar dissonance exists in rental housing. I presented staff with an empirical business model that could bring down housing costs for middle income families by 25 to 30%. These would rely on ground leasing of vacant or underutilized real estate consumed by the public. To wrap it up. So thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Next speaker, please. You can. Good evening, vice mayor garcia, city council members. And the city. I am Francis. Emily Dawson Harris and I reside in District one. I want to commend the city for all that, the planning. Commission and everyone involved and the process of putting. Together this phenomenal. Amazing document. You have a great task ahead of you this evening regarding the 2013 2012 housing element as part of the city's general plan. When making your. Decision, I trust that you will consider the needs of all persons. Now, there are some issues of concern I would just give to you and think about, and you can decide whether or not you want to address some, such as setting a time limit regarding presenting a citywide mixed. Income housing ordinance. To City Council. Setting aside a 10% very low income requirement for new apartment buildings appears to be a reasonable request. However, I would like you to consider that is a higher, even equal need for ensuring affordable housing throughout the city. Having units such as band units which. Require income eligibility and such housing is not section eight or hat housing. A person can have a catastrophic health condition. They could lose an income income of two in the family. They could be considered moderate income, low income. And all of a sudden now they. Become. Low income and the availability. Of them giving assistance is not so readily available. Setting a timeline for finding options for finding sources for the housing trust fund determine whether or not a commercial linkage fee is constitutional. That is. Can it be implemented? I'm a little concerned about that whole issue. So maybe someone can kind of. Explain what that. That is. About. And I want to. There's a concern regarding Section eight housing, the availability of vouchers. I'm out and about and seeing more and more. Persons that are homeless. And when they speak about Section eight, they said there's no Section eight housing available, and yet there's been 200 vouchers set aside for persons, specifically the disabled. So I would like you to look into that. But I want to say bravo for. A foreclosure registry program, the university design program identifying. Our MPD 29 LBB by right silence for emergency shelters and the rent escrow. Account program to address about habitat penalty. Issues. So I trust that you're going to make the right decision. I approved the plan, but there are some issues that concern that I think you may want to look at, too, and I'll turn. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. Mike Dunphy. I live at 488 Ocean Boulevard. I'm president of Ocean Residents Community Association and serve on the board of the DRC as well. We support or I support the housing element as it stands. One one concern is this the inclusionary housing. The discussion of that worry, a new development. Oh, and also I'm a real estate broker and manage property throughout Long Beach and primarily in the downtown area and in this inclusionary housing where percent goes to to low income. So a. Hundred new units get built and ten or. 20% go to. Low income are middle income. Non-Market housing? Well, the question is, who would who would get it? How? I mean, logically, it would be either some people that are following a very narrow, tightly defined gap or someone well-connected who really knows the system. How could that be fair? And then what happens later once their situations change or after that's been bought? How does that stay? I just have known in other developments that just that does not work. So if you're looking to buy a property or to rent a property in in in a project that is at X percentages for low income housing, honestly, ask yourselves, do you think does that make a project sound better? You know, it did it. It did does it if you're paying market price, it just it just. Doesn't make it sound better. Hear from the developers. It changes the cost basis. It's it's handicapping. The development of down here. There's there's the especially downtown there's a shortage of of above moderate income housing. When you want when you come you don't want more 99 cent stores, more vapor cigaret shops you don't want more head shops you want you want a Trader Joe's, you want all this stuff. We have to have a demographic that supports that. We have to have a demographic that supports all the things that you that you guys all promise and say you want for our city as well. So I just a really, really, really am concerned if this will this will hamper our development in the new projects that come down here. And we won't get our Trader Joe's and everything like that. It will be it will be a different type of of retail and job base. And it will be it it will it will. It will hurt us all. So and there's. Anyways, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Mr. Vice Mayor. Members of the Council. I'm Joe Garnham. I'm President of the Downtown Residential Council. You heard from me at the study session about this subject. I recently wrote an op ed piece supporting the approval of the housing element without modification, and I thought to myself, Well, what else can I possibly say? I want you to to get this done. I think it's an excellent document. I've had the opportunity to read it. I believe it's a great start. There is one thing. About 30 years ago, I was a real estate developer and I built a housing edition and I included in it a standard of a higher standard than was ever required, including six inch concrete streets. And this was in Oklahoma. You can probably relate to Oklahoma today with all the bad weather news that comes out of there with extremely low and then in the summer, extremely high temperatures. Well, last summer, my wife and I returned. There for a. Wedding in. The area and visited that same subdivision. And that subdivision is amazing. It looks like it was when it was first built. 70% of the residents who purchased originally there still live in that addition. So it was all about creating the right plan and then letting it work. And that's what we're asking you to do here today. So we ask that you approve the housing element. I want to congratulate the staff on an excellent job and urge your support. Thank you. Next speaker. Good evening, Mr. Vice Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name is Craig Hodge and I serve as the President and CEO of the downtown Long Beach Associates. Nearly two years ago, after the adoption of the downtown plan, investment in our city's core is increasing. The important policy that the downtown plan presented embraces streamlined and incentivized development by increasing density, reducing parking requirements, simplifying adaptive reuse projects and much more. As a result of your leadership, several completed and progressing projects are now benefiting from the downtown plan, including, but not limited to the mill works development at Sixth Street and Pine Avenue, the Shoreline Gateway at Alamitos and Ocean Boulevard and the Edison Loft, situated at Long Beach Boulevard and First Street, which are creating hundreds of jobs and attracting new residents to stimulate Long Beach's economy. Tonight, you have the opportunity to serve in a leadership capacity again and establish policies that will incentivize positive development and improve quality of life. With the adoption of the housing element. After much review by community members, city staff and the California Department of Housing and Community Department, along with receiving unanimous approval from the Long Beach Planning Commission, the proposed version of this document provides sound policy and programmatic guidance with respect to preserving the quality of existing housing inventory. Additionally, the housing element proposes valuable new and returning programs such as Home Rehabilitation and Homeowner and Rental Assistance Program, which will undoubtedly improve quality of life for Long Beach's residential population. Adopting the housing element, as written, is critical to the continued success of development in downtown and the rest of Long Beach. There are many communities throughout Southern California that compete for high quality smart development, and the Long Beach community needs to continue to welcome such investments with open arms. Demand for new housing is increasing but has not yet reached pre-recession levels. Burdensome policies such as mandatory inclusionary housing and linkage fees will inhibit our ability to recover fully, fully from the housing crisis and reach our ultimate potential through advocacy for amendments to the housing element by various community. Groups are well-intended. They carry the potential to result in serious consequences. The cities of San Jose and Los Angeles both face lawsuits due to their inclusionary housing policies, one of which was which is still in appeals at the Supreme Court. The debate especially concerned is especially concerned about these proposed policies because 70% of the units identified for new development in the proposed housing element are located in downtown, potentially leading to a disproportionate burden. Thank you. On our city's score and the real possibility of housing segregation. Thank you for your. Thank you. Next speaker, please. All right. Let's cool. Close another. Good evening, City Council Vice Mayor. My name is Cindy Soto and I am a Long Beach resident, a disability and a housing advocate, and also the board president of Housing Long Beach. We come to this hearing tonight with a clear understanding of what is before us. With the state's recent letter to the city. You could easily pass this document as it is, and it will comply with state law. However, compliance cannot be our ultimate goal for us as advocates and for you as elected leaders. We want the very best for our city and all residents. The housing elements function isn't a pass fail system when thinking about these types of systems. One can realistically get a D-plus and still pass. But Long Beach is a world class city, and as such, our bottom line should not be simply to pass, but be excellent, and to utilize the opportunity to its fullest potential to make real and tangible challenges changes. I mean, to improve our city. As a disability rights advocate for many years. I often reflect on the Americans with Disabilities Act. And you see for us, the ADA was a great step forward. And yet we work to remain. And yet we work to remind cities and businesses to comply with the spirit of the law, not simply the letter of the law. Being a leader is not about meeting basic minimums, but it's about really improving. Yes, but about really improving a community's standard of living. This housing element cycle is your opportunity to do just that for Long Beach. You see, everyone in this room loves Long Beach. It is why we care enough to be here. And even though we disagree, it is why we fight for what we believe is right. It discourages me. But often, you know, often times that advocacy groups are set aside as being too controversial, you know, too negative or unwilling to compromise. But I want to remind you that we aren't here to fight you. As a resident who has been struggling with my own housing situation, this is about me, my neighbors, my friends. This is about a fight over. This isn't about a fight over policies. It is about our livelihood, stability and happiness. That is why we are here. And we will continue to be here. Finish here. Yo. The three. The three edits we are requesting, which will be shared later, are simple and yet will not only make the document stronger, but it will also surely show your commitment to the well-being of the thousands of residents who are impacted by housing quality affordability every day. Thank you very much. Thank you. It just. Her father. Cisco. Please begin. Good afternoon, Vice Mayor Robert Garcia, council members and city staff. My name is Lazaro Gonzalez. I stand before you today not only as a business owner and a property manager, but also as a small business owner. I live at 1127 Hoffman Avenue. My store is located on Seventh and Orange and it is called the Tithing Closet. I am also a graduate of the city's Neighborhood Leadership Program. I have worked closely, closely with my council officers. Our community projects. I am very active and highly invested in my community through providing residents that come to our store with different resources and through fundraising for families dealing with the aftermath of cancers. As a small business owner, affordable housing allows allows for residents to have more disposable income. People have a tendency for spending locally, and if they have more income, they can support small businesses like myself. Good quality, affordable housing would lead to people taking more of an interest not only in themselves, but in their community. As a homeowner, I am very active and invest highly in my community because I know the value of a good investment. As a homeowner, I first and foremost invest highly in the apartments I rent out because I know affordable quality housing would make for renters. Happy would make for happy renters and keep them very sustained. Allowing for a little longer also, which allows for longer renting periods and a happy, comfortable environment. As a property manager who takes a lot of pride in my property. I support the RE-UP program because it will ensure that property owners in my neighborhood will take as much pride in their property as I do in mine. As a community member, I strongly feel that good quality and affordable housing creates a pride, a pride of place. This will then transmit into the local communities. It will foster a greater activation in the local community, which studies have shown to decrease crime rates. In conclusion, there are a lot of host of there are a host of ways passing progressive policies which will assist me as a small business owner and bring a better community to me and all the families. I would rather see this happen much sooner than later. I urge each and every one of you to please consider what is being proposed to you by housing Long Beach. It's good policy for the benefit of the entire city. And by the way, good job. I love this city. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Good evening, Vice Mayor Garcia. Council members. My name is Porter Goldberg and I'm the administrative director for the LGBT Youth Center of Long Beach. I'm representing the center, Long Beach, and I'm also a steering committee member for housing Long Beach. And tonight, you have the opportunity to vote on a housing element worthy of our. World class city. And tonight, we are. Here to support you in adopting and implementing a housing element. Which takes into account the needs of all our residents, rich and poor, those with and those. Unfortunately without, by no fault of their own. You and your dedicated staff have met with us on numerous occasions and we are tremendously appreciative of your time and consideration of this incredibly important document. And the feedback we pre-released. Previously shared. Tonight, you have the opportunity to pass the document as is or to incorporate our proposed provisions into meaningful and measurable changes that will. Protect the most vulnerable in our community. And I'm here to explain our three proposed edits. First, we urge you to revise the housing element to include the consideration of a mixed income housing ordinance in 2014. Within the parameters of the law and in anticipation of the resolution of outstanding cases, we are simply asking for language to be included, which explores the sound public policy as a potential solution to the arguable shortage of affordable housing for low and very low income residents. Second, permanent dedicated local sources of funding also continues to challenge our city. We are optimistic that language has been included in the housing. Element, which identifies. This need. However, there remains the need to identify the source. We've listened to your feedback and realize that now is simply not the time to push for a commercial linkage fee. We have come to the table to compromise and we're hopeful. You sit here tonight in the same spirit. Just as RDA funding was set aside for affordable housing. We still believe that boomerang funds can serve the same purpose. We are still hopeful that the city will dedicate 20% of boomerang funds annually towards affordable housing development for the next eight. Years, beginning with fiscal. Year 1415. This low hanging fruit is a sound investment in the future of our residents and our city. Finally, we were elated that language has been included, which expresses a willingness. To explore the creation of a program here. We understand that city staff is incredibly busy with numerous projects, and we are here to offer any and all support necessary to research and execute this. Program in Long. Beach. We ask. That the housing element be revised to say that staff will present a re ordinance to the City Council for. Consideration and. Adoption at a public hearing in 2014. These programs have been implemented in both Oakland and Sacramento cities of similar size and there are numerous model examples. Available to Long Beach. We are confident that we can explore and vote on. RIPA in the next 12 months by working together. So we have three simple asks. And with the exception of rape, we're merely asking for you to include. Language that firmly lays out what our options are for the next eight years. I thank you in advance for your partnership and collaboration, and I look forward to reporting. Back to our. Constituents your support for a meaningful and measurable housing element. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Vice Mayor Garcia, city council members, staff and guests. My name is Stephanie League. I lived in Long Beach since 1992. Raise my children here and I work here as well in the first district, currently serving in my 14th year as the founding director of the New City School. We serve a diverse population of families, over 75% of whom currently qualify for free or reduced price meals due to their families low incomes. That means that the monthly paychecks brought home by my students hardworking parents don't cover what their children actually need, the greatest element of which is the cost of their home, their apartment, their shared room, or their converted garage. I've been making home visits for each of the last 14 years. It's part of the work that I do. I'm continually amazed to see how people try to make the best of the substandard and inadequate housing stock available to the working poor of our city. Every day I receive students and parents in my office who are dealing with an acute academic or behavioral challenge. And I'm noticing a trend. A high percentage of these cases tie back again and again to the family's housing troubles. Overcrowding has children sleeping in the same room with teenagers and adults where they grow up far too quickly. Not enough space for reading homework, certainly not. Enough room for them to play, which we know is necessary. For all children to be healthy infestations, unrepaired dangers, and a fear of a landlord who can easily replace them if they complain. Tonight and in the coming months, you have a chance to influence for the better, the lives of the children all over this city. The elements proposed by housing Long Beach in this housing element and the edits, pardon me, are simultaneously bold and practical. The research behind this proposal is solid. Components like rent, escrow, restoring the lost funding and thoughtful mixed income construction are timely and just what we need to make 2014. The year in which you make way for so many hardworking families to meet their children's basic needs, allowing them to thrive. I thank you so much for your consideration and for allowing me to share my perspective with all of you. Thank you. Next speaker. Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council. City Staff. My name is Andrew Housman. I live in District two here in Long Beach, and I'm a proud resident of this city. I've had the privilege and luxury, though, of growing up in a place that values affordable housing and in an affordable place. I grew up in rural Vermont, a nine acres of land around my house. Each of me and my brothers had our own bedroom, and my mom was able to stay home while my dad provided for us with just one job. When I moved to Long Beach, I realized that so many of the children and working families of our city did not have the same opportunities that I had here in Long Beach. We know, all of us know families that live with four, five, six people in a bedroom because of the lack of affordable and dignified housing in the consequences of this are real. While me and my brothers got to study in our own rooms in privacy. Families often don't have any space for their kids to do their schoolwork. Mom and Dad are working two jobs, both of them just to be able to afford the rent and to put food on the table. It's because of this contrast that I know afford it. Providing affordable housing is an incredibly important step to creating the type of city that all of us want here in Long Beach. In regards to the housing element you all are considering this evening. There are few changes that housing Long Beach, and I would recommend to help achieve our shared goal of additional affordable and quality housing in our city. The newest version of this housing element has four sources of new funding, which we all applaud, knowing that these new revenues would. And we'd love to work with all of you in making sure that these new revenues are there to secure our great housing need. However, many of these revenues are uncertain. Prop one C monies have dried up. No clear dollars have been allocated from AB 1484 yet and the amounts are uncertain because of this. We know and we know that this housing element you're considering is about real change and real progress in our city. And today, we urge the Council to adopt at least one concrete, clear funding source for the affordable housing we need. With the dissolution of redevelopment funds, we've lost a huge amount of revenue that was previously dedicated to affordable housing historically. 20%, like you all know of of of redevelopment funds was dedicated to affordable housing. A portion of that money is coming back to the city in the form of boomerang funds. But if we today set aside 20% of these boomerang funds, just like we did with redevelopment money, we can provide an opportunity to ensure the protection of housing dollars for our city. Additionally, by doing this, we will make our city more competitive for additional federal state grants. We know that so much of the federal and state dollars come tied to matching funds. By setting aside these boomerang funds. We can help Long Beach be a more competitive city for state investments, and it will result in better housing options for all. Of us. This is a low hanging fruit and we can continue to assure our mutual and shared priority for providing the type of city that we all want where all of our families can live in dignity. So thank you all. Have a great night. Thank you. Next speaker. Good evening, Vice Mayor and Council on City Staff. My name is Scotty Hankey. I live in Rose Park and Second District. And I also am speaking on behalf of housing Long Beach and asked me to give my perspective as a homeowner. I have a 30 year, 30 year resident and homeowner and Rose Park, and it's the now the jewel in the crown of long beaches, historic districts. And I am very proud to be a rose park in. And my perspective is really coming from, you know, 30 years ago when we moved into the neighborhood and it turned out to be just, you know, drugs and gangs and alleys with dumpsters and and we were so shocked and we we said what to do and living conditions were intolerable. So you're bound together and you form a neighborhood association, of course. And I just want to tell you that, you know, tenacious and I will never give up. Rose Park remembers It's taken two decades, but we've transformed Rose Park into the most desirable place to live. And what I want to tell you is, during this period of of revitalization, something else happened that my friends and neighbors, they disappeared because they could not afford to live in Rose Park. And as other neighborhoods become more livable, this is going to come true again. Poor residents will be displaced. And I feel like we marginalized them and ghettoized them. Our poor and our low income people, they live where they can afford to live. And I feel that they were really completely marginalized from us. And my concern is that so they're stuck and so we can go to them. And one of the things we can do is with child housing, like Peter was proposing is the rent trust account rep is the first step. And this program, which our sister city, Los Angeles, has had in place for many years, ensures that minimum minimum housing standards are maintained within residential rental units. And I really urge the council to consider I. Know now in your. Plan you're going to research reap in 2014 determinant is appropriate in 2015 and then report your findings in 2016. And I really would like you to kind of speed the plow on this, because I think it's so important because of the issues of quality of life in this city. And everyone who lives their heads should have the same right to have it. And so you've really got to consider what we can do. If we're stuck out there and they can't get housing, then what can we do and whatever they're living in. So thank you very much for your time that. When I thought of this, that was me. No worries. Lilly Apprentice. Yeah. You're so. You remember the house in Long Beach? Maybe it is. Jonathan. Oh, there's a lecturer, an Iraqi lesbian all along. But they told me we need to split up from AZT, sit there and use a process. I'm a proximal mentee, so mother and father mistress equals economic, social, educational. But I'm in Mexico, so no pre-med or nanny. It is me, Princesa. You mean there is also. When is that social. Educational that those they use it don't they means for total need those little or no one to it. Assume for toda they told me the problem is this in the end this forget. Yes, honorable total always starts with. Good evening. My name is Lilia Fuentes and I'm a member of Housing Long Beach. My address is 810 Terry Avenue in Long Beach, California. I've been living here in the city for more than 17 years, approximately. I'm a mother who's responsible for my three children economically, socially and educationally. To me, my children come first. One of my granddaughters is my princess that I'm interested in her social and education well-being as well as that of all my future grandchildren. I would like a good future generation for all of my descendants because they're the future of this city. Lesbianism, the most animals. Mujer Rattus. Cucaracha. Sodomy, yes. Ella, he lost. Mana is not a part islanders party. They suffered thus if was the hour simply summoned again to say this company and my marina complaining of upper criminality who can also be a better one or less tolerant than what Westover May Manhattan Sour can offer less to work it. And as to where there's a gas eat a movie free and lesbian in cellphone no la cumbia one in honor casino to work at bar but I came from Brazil Guatemala Mika gay you're a lucky star myself at the those of what I see Tottenham grannies poor Casilla they had them lost animals lost in Santos collapsed go and the homes where we lived had rats, cockroaches, ants and the managers didn't repair the things that were problematic. There were water leaks, it was always leaking and the wood was damaged. One time I bought a stove because the manager said that it wasn't working, but when they installed the new stove, they told me that it wasn't the stove, but rather the pipes that weren't working. The homes were very cold and they didn't change the carpeting. On one occasion I had to pee so that they would put new carpeting in my daughter's room. Since she was the one that was the most affected, her whole body was bitten up by the insects that were there, if you remember about it, through a horrible chemicals and always felt that another button may come in which has a problem in my situation. Forget Korea. Can me see Costa? We had I don't know where they would operate, but on uncle training, you know potatoes are stubborn in my last condition is you kimono thing when I they gave me a boiler don't they don't care what solar is if there are many sequels that I start my solicitation I always had to work so that my children wouldn't lack anything. But I had to move many times because I wanted my children to have a safe place. But I couldn't find anywhere because they were all in the same bad condition. Since I don't have anybody support me, I have to speak for myself. I have to stand up and defend my children from all of these types of situations for a souvenir. Qui-Gon Apprentice there is. But I can say Penny Apple in Las Policias K StumbleUpon in Newcastle in Long Beach. So really being told I love to be in them is a system only the other division. This is a must at the seamless. No, I must but me. Me. But I'm familiar. So. No, but I mean, it started to Stockholm, Oneida and I'll say and the reason that is the reason that I'm here today in front of you so that you know, and so that you can support these policies that housing Long Beach is proposing within the housing element. We need to better the quality of the homes and let them be more affordable. And it's not just for me and my family, but for the well-being of our whole community. For her here are best are the good thing I address, you know. But I'm not being honest then, Mrs. Braxton, but I represent that it's I think it has to get Sparky's care not don't they be we get jealous person ask for on a personal ministerial assembly that is the base can them maybe a no you're lucky you get it gives that person assistant I he is that mutual system and so Scarsdale hospital you're not in in don't they on the vivid so in spite of the fact that I was operated on recently it's been less than three months but I'm here to represent those people the ones that live in the parks because they don't have a place to live. The people that have fought for our safety of our country, for our well-being, and the people that are here that might be living on the street or they might be in a home without a place. I include ostomy home hierarchy as well as persons are most. I mean source was bozza is or nina l obviously say you're not in emperor by that I stay on the apartamento commode ever. They said. They said to me they called me. Well, yeah, they said we call on my mother La Mujer and even my oldest son was in the armed forces. So sometimes he, his wife and his little girl don't have the money to pay for an apartment. Sometimes they have to live with me or they live with the girls. Mom, he. Come on. Minus the normal obligation, they they be read as equal monies, equal to the personas as he comatose como or money that and as humans we have the obligation to live with other humans. We're part of humanity. So thank you very much. Hey, thank you. Next. Good evening, city staff, city council and Honorable Mayor. My name is Brooke Clovis, and I'm a constituent of the third district and a graduate student at Cal State Long Beach. I live on 5050 East Garfield Street. Over the past couple of months, I have attended city council meetings, the recent planning commission hearing and study session. I have heard on the I have heard from those who are opposed to the community platform saying that we need to develop a long beach that attracts highly educated young people. I have heard this statement on various occasions. As a graduate student, someone who may be considered highly educated, this is quite concerning. After listening to public comments, it sounds like some Long Beach residents and stakeholders would like to transform Long Beach into a small town, beach, state, city, a city with no poverty and only upper middle class residents. While the demographics of a beach city may be appealing to some transferring Long Beach and to Newport, Newport, Redondo or even Beverly Hills is not the solution to achieving a prosperous economy and reducing crime with crime rates as it poses a threat to many Long Beach residents and myself. The development of housing stock that is only market rate will lead to the displacement of low and middle income residents and families in Long Beach because the low paying service sector jobs that pay minimum wage are growing and City Council has not identified a permanent local source of funding for affordable development. Many of our valuable residents will no longer be able to live here. Even I fear that after I graduate with my master's degree, I will not be able to find a job in Long Beach where I can afford rent, meet my basic needs, and save my money. Save money to own a home. This is why it's important for the city to offer its working class residents a safe and healthy home that is affordable, affordable to their income level. Further transforming Long Beach into a beach city will kill what makes Long Beach one of the most unique cities in the United States, its diversity. When I moved to Long Beach, I was not attracted to the upscale developments or tourism industry. I was attracted to its diverse population, progressive reputation and unique local businesses. In no other city have I felt a sense of belonging and community where diverse populations come together to find solutions to the challenges they encounter. If the city continues to develop without affordable developments, many of Long Beach residents will be displaced and our diverse population will be obsolete. So rather than focusing on what types of people we need to attract to Long Beach, the city should make the needs of its current residents a priority. Research has shown that when people can afford to live locally, they invest locally. And when residents and families have good paying jobs and stable homes, crime decreases. As a new resident of this great city, I urge you to use your leadership and take action. Make this housing element about more than just compliance. Make it about strategic action that improves the quality of life for Long Beach residents and makes Long Beach an even greater city to live in. Thank you. Next to. Good evening, counsel. My name is Janine Pearce. I know many of you. I am a second district resident and I'm director at Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, where our mission is to make sure that all working families have a living wage, a roof over their head, and that we're working on new development and we're working on new ways to make sure our cities are thriving, that they're not a city of the past, but that we're continuing to grow and inspire new business to come in and to make sure that residents are able to contribute to that. And so as a part of that mission, affordable housing has always been something at the heart of what we do. Madeline Janis, one of our co-founders, was on the Redevelopment Agency Committee in Los Angeles for ten years where she fought to make sure that we did have strong development that included affordable housing. Why do we need to have affordable housing if we have workers making a living wage in the city, which I'd like to applaud all of you for taking a stand on living, wages are really critical. Living wages are to make sure that we meet the bare necessities again. Same thing with the document that you have in front of you. It sets the bottom, it doesn't set the top. And so at $13 an hour, workers are bringing home if if they're working 40 hours a week at $13 an hour, they're bringing home roughly $27,000 a year for the federal government. They mandate, they say, that for a worker to be able to afford housing, that it should be at 30% of their income level or less. So a worker making $27,000 a year, they're barely able to afford housing. They would still qualify for what the federal government mandates as low income housing. So for that reason, even with the living wage, we need to make sure that we have affordable housing at some level to where families can make sure that they're not living on top of each other in poor conditions. We've heard from previous tenants. We know that the workers in the city are 35 I'm sorry, 50% of the residents in the city spend 35% of their income on housing. If we want to have a city that's thriving, we want to make sure that the residents here have money to spend. It's the same argument as was made with measuring. If families have money in their pocket, they're going to spend it locally. Let's make sure that we're building a city that can thrive for everyone and that residents here can live healthy. They can spend money in local businesses and make sure that we are a thriving city that we want to have. And so that's why Lane and the Long Beach Coalition stand with housing. And it's a core issue. That's very important to us, and we look forward to voting on that on the small edits tonight and making sure that we can do this in 2014 instead of pushing it on to where we've forgotten what a program is. And to make sure that we do find a dedicated source of funding the 20% that was taken out of the affordable out of the housing trust fund. We want we want to make sure that that's put back. So thank you very much for your time and your leadership. And doing that. I rise to a point of order according to procedures, that my patient as speaker is allowed to get his ideas off his mind. If it's not on the agenda, that's guaranteed. At the beginning, I was assured I would be fourth place. Obviously, I'm not the fourth placed speaker now. I like to have feedback on that. This is public. This is on hearing item number one. This is not public comment, Mr. Dunn. Well, as a rule, we have public comment prior to actual agenda. No, prior to the consent calendar, not prior to hearings. What would I be wrong in saying that three three slots are allowed for a speaker after the proceedings? You're out of order. This is not public comment. Well, you need to. Speak on a housing issue. How are you going forward? Mr. Dunn, I have your name here for public comment. We're not there yet. Okay. Thanks. Next, please. Hi. My name is Kelvin Johnson. I live on 744 Pine Avenue Pharmacy. I'm a single dad and I work for you. Thank you all for giving me a job. I appreciate it. Oh, hey. I understand that, um, I was before this job. Hey, I slept on the outside the beach. It's cold out there. I feel bad about all the hard work, all the bombs and all the people that live in. Under the. Under the. The streets that. That had no homes. Low income housing. I lived all my life in low income housing. I worked for years and I still came for the house. But that's all right. That's another thing. But other than that, I do support affordable housing because it do help the neighborhoods. I lived here 40 years up. Four years of my life. I lived here all my life. And I'm getting tired. Really. Right now I'm getting tired of African Americans. Yeah. Pushing African Americans out of here. Creating your own. Your own city. Because. I used to live here. African-Americans did live here and had they own homes. And all of a sudden, now they're selling their homes. I'm an African-American man. I got one. I got two kids, Desiree and and I got a stepdad, Isaiah Tapp, that he. He's he's a good man because he always help out the people in the neighborhood because winning when it was down. Now he was on drugs, but he changed his life and he now he came in third in line. If the kids need to go walk across the street and he used to pull out his stop sign and walking across the street. You know, I'm I'm proud of him to get off the drugs and I'm proud of him to do the job that he do. And I'm happy that I'm here and now. Thank you all for. Thank you all for letting me. Be representing here. And I really am. And I know of. Is it about. But I don't think Trader Joe's will hire any African-Americans because they're getting pushed out to the back end of the city. And and no, I'm not because I don't got the know, but it's so good. But I understand. I'm a citizen of the city. I'm just getting tired of seeing condos over here in downtown Long Beach. Have nobody and nobody filling them. We need more affordable housing to take care of that. Thank you very much. And have a nice day. Good evening, Mayor. Council members. My name is Don Hour. I'm a member of the. North Pine Neighborhood Alliance and the Downtown Residential Council. I'm a veteran of over 30 years service in the military and my disabilities, and I struggle like everybody does, regardless of income. And I would just like to comment, especially on the great job that the staff has done in all the programs that they're presenting that we have in Long Beach. Amy Bodak spelled them all out, and I'm so amazed how many programs there are. I don't think many people realize it. Long Beach has more than most cities, an entire. Southern California area. In my 30 years in the military, I worked my way up from the bottom and up and I lived in low income housing. And I remember in Boston where I lived and in low income housing on a reclaimed dump, and with my four children and traveling around the country. 23 different duty stations and little over 30 years service. So I'm quite familiar with the. Struggles, struggles and stresses of living. On a limited income. I think that the program that's presented here, the housing element is not just minimal. I think it's above and beyond what you would expect. I was amazed. Most of my time was on the East Coast and I helped produce programs, as a matter of fact, for low income military personnel. And when I came out here. In Long Beach, my last duty station. In 1980. I was amazed how many programs this city, as a beach city has. I can't believe it. The East Coast. I mean, if you if you lived on the on the coast, I mean, you really lived it up. That's something you worked for throughout the years. It isn't something. That that normally people that didn't have much money lived. And I was amazed what Long Beach has done to. To help people of lower income. I think that what. We have here, my last duty station here in Long Beach, I was the district housing officer. I moved my way up through the ranks. And before I retired. I was a district housing officer in Southern California here from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Helping lower ranked, low income people find housing. So I know the struggles and I know what. What it is to live in it myself. But I think Long Beach's. Been above and beyond what we could expect. And I'm just so. Proud of what the programs that are presented, and I really urge you to approve this as it stands. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Nano. Next to. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. My name is Sandy Sanchez, and I represent the Building Industry Association. Of Southern. California, Los Angeles, Ventura County's Chapter. We are a trade association representing about a thousand member companies and their employees. Our members are for rent, for sale, affordable housing developers, as well as all the trades and the the employees that make up every aspect of home building. From plumbers, electricians, roofers, painters, escrow companies, etc.. And I'm here to ask you to please adopt the housing element as presented. Staff and the professional consultant team has worked tirelessly to present this document, and moving forward with an inclusionary housing proposal only is a detriment to moving jobs forward. Our housing industry has been tremendously impacted by this downturn and Great Recession. We are looking to create jobs, not prevent jobs from moving forward. We're looking to have this economy pick up. And the way to do that is by obviously creating more jobs. Quality jobs that pay good, good dollars and help stimulate the economy and make housing more affordable. When we add linkage fees, it only makes housing less affordable. And I think it's important to to realize that development in general is not opposed to affordable housing and finding solutions. You know, this is not a Long Beach issue. It's a state issue. It's a national issue. We need to deal with it on a global level. Currently, at the state level, we have the DeSaulnier Bill SB 391, which offers a broader base for funding to help address affordable housing. And I think we need to look at opportunities like this bill. It's not perfect, but it is a way to address affordable housing and we need to look at it from a global perspective. I think adding it without careful analysis will only hurt and hinder future growth not only in Long Beach but throughout the state and throughout the country. I strongly encourage you to adopt the housing element as presented, and I thank you and staff and the professional consultant team that put this document forth together tonight. Thank you. Good evening, Diane, which means I'm also a disabilities rights advocate, and I do understand the need for housing assistance. However, inclusionary housing and linkage fees are extremely discriminatory against individuals. Rather than spreading the burden over an entire population. It's a sure way to destroy incentive. There's a simple rule here. If you force inclusionary housing or inclusionary housing in linkage fees, you will drive up the costs. You will eliminate the incentive to build. And developers can just go elsewhere to invest their time, effort and money. And they will. Thank you. Thank you. Next, we. Hello. Good evening to you. My name is Laura Marine, and I am a Long Beach transplant. I have lived here since 2007. I am also I also graduated from the Neighborhood Leadership Program here in the city of Long Beach. And I, too, live Long Beach. I am a documentary filmmaker, and I come here with a unique perspective. My partner and I directed a 30 minute documentary for housing in Long Beach. I was able to hear stories of stories in which you heard before about people living in crowded conditions, people living in rat and other insect infested apartments, and what they all wanted, what the bottom line was. They wanted affordable housing and they wanted to live in dignity with their families. They feel that their. The bottom line was not that they were poor. The bottom line is that they're here trying to have and trying to live a better life for themselves and their children. And they feel that that will definitely be threatened. These were just a few of the many stories of the people living day to day, paycheck to paycheck here in the city of Long Beach. So I asked the city council members and the city excuse me, I asked the city council members and citizens of Long Beach. Also, all of us should have the right to live in decent conditions which give all residents of Long Beach dignity. Please don't make people have to choose between paying the rent. Or paying for food. Thank you very much. Have a great evening. Thank you. Next to. Good evening, Mayor and City Council. My name is Carrie Gallagher. I live at 626 East Eighth Street in the First District. And I'm here tonight as the executive director of housing Long Beach. You know, when I walked in tonight, a representative of the debate asked if I would wear one of their stickers. And I put it on because it says, we support the housing element and we do. And so I think that hopefully we can walk away tonight finding that, in fact, maybe we have more in common that we often than we often like to think. Because I look around at this room and I see my neighbors, I see my city, I see my community, every person in this room. And I think we all have a shared vision for healthy residents. We all have a shared vision for economic vitality. And we all share the vision for a thriving Long Beach. And so I think it should be noted that at the Planning Commission hearing, the city council study session and even tonight, you have heard little to no opposition around a number of the points that we've been proposing, especially the program, and expedite the expediting of the timeline of this program, as well as the allocation of 20% of boomerang funds as they return to the city. And so I really want to just step back and housing Long Beach as an organization, as a community. Advocates really want to thank the city for the time and effort that they've put into this document for the efforts that staff and council have put into meeting with us and hearing about our concerns as we work with hundreds of residents on a weekly basis and here the living conditions that people are facing. And so I want to reiterate tonight again that compliance does not necessarily equate to leadership. Leadership goes beyond compliance. Leadership goes beyond the bottom line. And so that we have crafted a document that will work with the state. We hope that you will work with us as community members to react, to craft an even stronger document that will have concrete and tangible changes for residents in the coming eight years as this housing element is put into place. Many of you are aware that housing Long Beach asked for and for this hearing date to be pushed back since it's so soon and residents are just returning from their holiday breaks and unfortunately the city was not able to accommodate that request. And what we heard from the city manager's office was this was largely due to the fact that we wanted to ensure we would have sufficient time to make any edits. And so I would like to remind you that the housing element is due to the state on February 12th. So whatever you do tonight and the edits that you're able to make, we have more than sufficient time to make those changes before this document goes to the state or is due to the state in five weeks time. Lastly, I just want to reiterate our three edits that we are asking you to make tonight. The first is that the element would be revised for the ordinance to be presented to the City Council by June of 2014. The second is that the housing element would be revised to allocate and protect 20% of boomerang funds as they return to the city for the next eight years for affordable housing. And the last is that the housing element should be revised to say that the city will consider a mixed income housing ordinance within the parameters of the law and in anticipation of outstanding cases. Thank you again for your work and for your attention to this issue, and we look forward to working together in the future. Your next. Council members. My name is Pat Denniston. I live at 3595 Santa Fe Avenue, space number 149 in Wynwood Village. I had no intention of speaking tonight. I came here to learn because I had been reading a lot in the newspaper about the housing element. And I have learned a lot tonight. And what I've learned is that you have. Really. Worked hard to put together something for this city that will give housing, affordable housing. To all. Now, affordable housing, though, can come in various stages. In 1945, it was then that my father drove the car into California. I have lived here in Long Beach ever since that day. I love Long Beach, but there are some things that I'd like to see changed, just like anyone else. So I want to ask you a question, and probably if you could answer my question right off the bat, I wouldn't go any further. But the question is this How are the people living in mobile home parks affected by this element? Were they taken into consideration back in 1985? My husband and I made the decision to move into Windward Village because it was a beautiful mobile home park. But when we looked at. Finances, we said, when we retire, we want to be able to support ourselves and not live off of someone else. And we knew we could do it at that. So we moved in there. It seems to me that we can be doing everything possible to get the people off the street. But here's what has happened in our park. A few years back, the city council approved a. Subdivision for a windward. Village and the majority of the residents were not in favor. Now, for the last four years. Our rent has been raised. $50 a month. For the last four years. You also cannot sell your home unless they buy the lot also, which is overpriced to begin with. That lowers the equity on our home greatly and it puts us down, way down in the income level. People are having to walk away and leave everything there. And if you have not seen it, please come. I'll be glad. To walk you around the park and show you. I'm sorry. It's very difficult. I know. It's emotional. I apologize. You really have to. I do. I will do it right now. As of now, there are approximately. 40 to 50 who have bought their land. That is out of 305 units. That's not a very high percentage. So I ask you, you figure. Out how many are. Being displaced. We're seeing it happen. Okay. So I ask you again, how are the people living in the mobile home parks affected by this element? That's all I want to know. Thank you, ma'am. We'll try to get that answer for you. Thank you. Amy, you have a quick answer for that. Mayor, members of the city council. We did actually address that issue. It is a brand new program that we've never had the ability to fund or implement because of some previous funding constraints that we had related to mobile home parks. But we do have a program that. I'm. Trying to find that specifically provides program 3.3 D Mobile Home Repair Grants. The city proposes to create a new program that provides up to $12,000 per unit in grants for repairs of mobile homes occupied by extremely low income households. This program would be funded by the Housing Trust Fund. We have found in the past that residents who own mobile coaches have had difficulties getting loans because of the loan to value ratios that they have. And there have been cases where there have been extreme needs for emergency repairs to roofs or heaters to keep those. Mobile coaches habitable. So as part of this housing element, we did specifically craft this as a grant to eligible residents. I thank you, Amy. I want to take it behind the rail. Thank you all for your comments, Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you, Mayor, and I appreciate the many speakers who came out and spoke to passing this item. And I you know, Pat, as much as one of my constituents. I appreciate your advocacy as. A mother. When we're at Village Folks and of course, you know, I've been out there many times. And part of the challenge is the state of California actually has a lot of regulatory control over mobile home park. So that's kind of a complicating factor there. But I will say that I think, you know, going back in time, I wasn't on the council, but the vote to subdivide that two lots may have been a mistake. So I hear you're concerned about that. One question I have for you, Ms.. Bodak, is we've heard a lot of people here advocate tonight for this program, which apparently they've said has worked in Los Angeles. Now, we're not Los Angeles. We're a different city, but certainly we're wise enough to learn from others. I know we've talked about this briefly before, but you walk us through what staff are proposing. It sounds like you're proposing to stay this issue and come back in 2016 with some some communication to council. Can you talk about what you're planning to do on the subject? Certainly for members of the public and the city council, this is related to program 3.3 I somewhere around page 117. In the red line version, we are looking at issues related to code enforcement and general habitability is an issue that we must address. The housing element does demonstrate that we have a substantial amount of units that are 50 years or older and that does present potential issues related to habitability. So in as you know, we have a pretty vigorous code enforcement program. Now, the advocate groups have asked us to consider a specific program, which is Los Angeles based, related to a rent escrow account or the acronym REAP. We are not sure that that program is necessarily the best thing for Long Beach or the most appropriate program for Long Beach, but committed to doing research on the issue and trying to understand what the need is that we're trying to solve with implementing a program. The City of Los Angeles program is a multimillion dollar program that has 11 full time staffers committed to it in one department. That does not include the additional staff in auxiliary departments of financial management, city attorney or city clerk. But we did commit to looking at this as a potential issue, too, to address habitability issues. But to give you a comparison, there's approximately 176,000 units in the city of Long Beach. We believe we handle approximately 10,000 code enforcement cases every year. Those code enforcement cases range from a substandard building to an illegal garage conversion to graffiti and paint peels and an oversize fence. So those 10,000 cases are not all related to habitability issues, but some of them are just pure esthetical issues. Others are clearly much more serious. That equates to about 5.5% of the total housing stock in the city we have handled in the in the fiscal year 2012, 10,000 code enforcement cases. Of those, only 24 were substandard building code cases. So so we're not sure what, what the need is that we're trying to resolve. But in in in an effort to make sure that we are addressing code enforcement as much as possible and are doing the best that we can to address habitability issues we have agreed to to look into not only the Los Angeles program, but other programs as well. We are committing to investigating these opportunities by the end of 2014 and to report those findings to the City Council in 2015. And then if the City Council wishes us to proceed, implement an actual program and strategy by the end of 2015. So I had her in a meeting earlier today that it was no action. If action were to happen and we're not going to bind ourselves, we need to get well-educated issue. The plan was saying it would be in 2016. So it sounds like you're saying that's inaccurate, that according to the plan you're submitting or you submitted to the state the says discussion in 2014 and then action, if any, in 2015. Is that correct? That's what I'm reading. All right. Well, thank you. And for the clarification. The other question I had is there seems to be a concern from some residents out there about the bad landlords. And, you know, my father in law is a landlord and we know the vast majority of landlords, like the vast majority of people, are good folks doing the right thing. But there may be 1% or 3% who aren't. And it sounds like one concern out there is people may not be calling code enforcement because they're afraid of being evicted or having the rent raised in retaliatory fashions, which probably are illegal under state law. But because these folks may be low income or not sophisticated, don't have the ability to protest that. So what if someone is in that situation where they're fearing calling the city because they're afraid of being evicted or having their rent raised in retaliation? What's our answer to help that person? There's actually two things. If a person calls, they can talk about code enforcement related to the general building. It doesn't necessarily have to be to the specific unit. If there are code enforcement issues related to the general building, there is no way of the landlord knowing what the issues are and who raised them, because the our reports are are kept confidential on who the reporting entity is. We also do a lot of referrals, particularly to not only legal aid, but also to the Fair Housing Foundation, where we do ask both of those entities to help us address some of those issues. So we do believe that, you know, that is a concern that's out there with the number of tenants. We've had numerous discussions with the Apartment Owners Association in terms of educating their landlords on habitability issues and those processes will continue. I don't necessarily think though that focusing on the rep program will address that issue. Okay. Well, I appreciate then I just ask that, you know, after tonight, you continue to have these conversations and really figure out, like I said, most landlords are great folks doing the right thing. And frankly, probably the people involved in the apartment association aren't the problem. But there are some folks out there who are clearly taking advantage of some of these low income folks. And and I think maybe part of the answer is just informing them what rights they already have and making sure that everybody knows, considering these, including as advocacy groups, what the right channels are. So I want to thank you for putting a lot of hard work in this plan over the last couple of years and look forward hearing from my colleagues. What's their Garcia? Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I want to, you know, first just start off by thanking staff for their hard work. This has been, I know, a lot of hard work for not just Ms.. Building, but for the entire team. And I also want to thank the community, the whole community for not just coming out tonight, but for working and being involved in this plan. The reality is, is that what we have in front of us is a solid document that, quite frankly, is a better document because all of you had so much input in it. And where it was, I think, when it was first presented to where it is now because of input, particularly from housing advocates and and those that have been involved in this discussion for so long, we've been able to make some changes, I think, along the way that have made this a stronger document. I also will agree with one of our speakers who spoke about I think there's a lot more, quite frankly, that we all agree on than disagree. I think at the end of the day, we all want, regardless of where you live in Long Beach, we all want a healthy city. We all want businesses to succeed. We all certainly want to help those that need our help the most and those that are having challenges of poverty and other issues. So I think that we we do agree more than we disagree. And I think, you know, for for a lot of us particularly see a lot of my downtown neighbors that are here, I think that most of us I would include myself. I certainly bought a place downtown because I liked the diversity of the neighborhood and not just the diversity of the people, but also the economic diversity. I love the fact that there are all types of people of all ages, of all colors, of all income levels that live in my neighborhood. And that's certainly something that I value and a place that I enjoy to live and hope that my neighborhood stays stays that way. I want to continue on on the issue of the rent escrow account program for now, and I'm sure there's a lot of other additional comments. So, I mean, the way I've. Simplified the program in just the research that I've done is we're really talking about a an enforcement tool mechanism that could produce a really important tool for us to go after some of these, quite frankly, in some cases, slumlords and those that are really not just taking advantage of the renters, but are, quite frankly, creating incredible blight throughout the city. And I know some of there are some of my ah willmore neighbors that are here as well. And the reality is you drive, whether it's Willmore or whether someone was here earlier from Rose Park or some of these neighborhoods, there are some of these cracker box apartments that are just completely below that. I would classify them as substandard. So I'm not sure what our substandard classification is that we use at the city, but certainly I believe there's there's a lot more than the 24 that we found through code enforcement cases last year. So I guess I'm wondering, Ms.. Barack, I do have a question on the first version of the housing element had a reference to the city having possibly 10,000 or maybe 10,000 units that were kind of on the brink of being subsistence sub standard. And then I don't know that it's in this current version is that can you explain to me how that moved or changed? We have approximately 10,000 code enforcement cases annually. When we first looked at and did the the underlying data analysis that fed into the the document, we were using code enforcement information based on a three month period for the current fiscal year excuse me, the last current the last fiscal year since that the first draft was produced in the spring. We have since been able to revise the numbers to accommodate for a full year of data. And so the numbers did change. But as I did say, we do have approximately 10,000 code enforcement cases on an annual basis. So. I. I, for one, am interested in us doing our research on this rent escrow account program. And I would agree that just because ELAs works a certain way doesn't mean ours would work the same way. And I think, Ms.. Barak, you and I had a discussion earlier about, you know, kind of figuring out what what the Long Beach model would be or if there was a if there was a program out there. Maybe it's it's another program out there. I know Sacramento does something that's that's different than Los Angeles, but still similar. But but finding what could work for us and they could still go and address some of these these tenant improvement these landlord improvement issues. And these these developments that we have, I think would be would be very beneficial for us. I do I am concerned a little bit about our about our timeline. I would think that we would be able to revisit that this year. I don't think it necessarily needs to be. You know, we don't have all the information, but I think that it would be important for the council to be able to have a discussion sooner rather than later about what this could look like for us. Give our input, allow the community to give input, and then work towards building a program like this. If it were and you're right, we're not sure yet what could work for us. But certainly I think the sooner that we know, I think would be a good thing. Certainly, I do want to point out that we must wait for the state to give their final blessing on the housing element. They have up to 90 days to do that. So theoretically, if we submit this by February 12th, we would be waiting until May at a minimum to know that we have a certified housing element. I don't think it is feasible for us to get a certified housing element and conduct research and come back to you by June. I just do not think that that's feasible. We put in here timeframes that we felt that we could commit to. I do not want to have to explain myself in future years as to why we were unable to do something because we didn't have enough time to do something or we didn't have adequate staff resources. So this is why we came up with the timelines that we did for 2014 and 2015. Certainly it is within your discretion to change that and we will do our best to comply with that. But there were there was a method to the madness of coming up with these schedules. Well, I'll be interested to hear my other colleagues input on this, but if we're able to, I think, get information sooner, that'd be that'd be a good thing on this issue. Grand jurors. Yes. Thank you, Mayor. I'd like to ask the city manager what would be the 20% impact on the city if we hear between. Mayor and councilmembers? There's talk about boomerang funds. We really don't know what a boomerang fund is. These moneys that are coming to us, we don't have a redevelopment agency anymore. So the dollars that come to us through our property taxes go into the general fund. We program those. As you know, we present to you a three year budget, the moneys that are in our property tax, go to the general fund and support police, fire, parks and recreation, things that are in our general fund. So if indeed the Council decided to lessen the amount of property tax that we get in assigned that to another fund, certainly that's something that would put us in a deficit next year. Thank you. All right, Mr. Neal, let's get a motion or somebody to Neill. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I appreciate the dialog that has gone back and forth here. I do have some questions along the line of the vice mayor, Miss Barack, in regards to reporting back in in the area of rape. Would would December be adequate time for you and your staff to come back to this council with something that we could look at? Sir, we do have something that that does discuss us concluding our research by the end of 2014. So we would be able to conclude that research on not just the program, but the Sacramento program, the Oakland program, this franchise tax board, substandard housing program, and then any other programs that the advocates would wish us to look at . Thank you. And Mr. City Manager. In your last statement, you said that if we were to look at boomerang funds, we would be putting the the general fund in a deficit. If I if I understand you correctly, did not the housing funds come out of the. Wasn't 20% of the housing funds derived from the redevelopment? How would that put us in a deficit when. Council members when we had a redevelopment agency, 20% of the dollars in the redevelopment agency did go to affordable housing. And as everyone knows, we had one of the more robust housing programs in the state of California. There is no redevelopment agency anymore, so there are no redevelopment dollars to take 20% aside from. So the redevelopment department does not exist. There are no redevelopment tax increment dollars coming to the city. So what has happened? The taxes, the incremental taxes that were paid then went to the general that went to the redevelopment agency no longer exists. Those funds now go to the city as property tax in the general fund arena. So there are no 20% set aside dollars that exist from the redevelopment agency because the redevelopment agency no longer exists. So that being said, what is the plan for us to address our housing requirements moving into the future? Councilmember as you saw in the report, we have millions of dollars this year and coming to us in the future for the housing arena right now, Amy said, we have about $16 million in the bank that are that can be allocated to housing projects today. As you know, on a structural basis, we have approximately, I think Amy pointed out, $85 million coming to us on an annual basis to our housing authority for Section eight vouchers. Many of them go to our homeless families. We also have home dollars that come to us on an annual basis. Those dollars are used for affordable housing. Also, our CDBG dollars, we have a certain percentage of the CDBG Community Development BLOCK Fund grants on a structural basis that go forward, that come into us for housing. Other than that, we also have some housing bond moneys. That is one time that that we do expect. And as Amy did point out, we're all aware that the Downtown Redevelopment Agency was going to expire in, I think, 2017. That portion of the Downtown Redevelopment Agency owes the city approximately $110,000 or so. The state has agreed to refund those dollars to us, and that was part of the legislation. And 20% of all of those proceeds will come back to the city for affordable housing. But again, that's money that will come to us as debt repayment from the state in a couple of years. Is 23 million. Did you know? Pardon? 10 million. Million? Yes. Sorry. I want to make sure we got the right message. Just took a few zeroes out, that's all. And one final question, Mr. West, in regards to the boomerang funding, what is the estimate or can you estimate what we will be receiving in years to come? Again, it's just that the concept of what a boomerang fund is, to use the word boomerang, means that we're continuing to receive redevelopment dollars that boomerang and come back to the city. There is no redevelopment agency. There are no funds that are boomeranging back to the city from the redevelopment agency. The redevelopment agency is dead. It's gone. We're not reaching out to recreate it. It's gone. So what comes to us now is property tax without the redevelopment agency. From what I understand, Mr. GROSS isn't here tonight, but I believe our excess property tax comes to us in the amount of approximately $8 million annually. And if you wanted to reduce that by 20%, we would lose whatever. 20% of $8 million would be 1.6 million. Yes, sir. Okay. So let me make sure I understand this correctly. So in 2014, you're saying we're not going to get any boomerang funds. In 2015, we're not going to receive any boomerang funds. We are receiving property tax, an additional $8 million of property tax annually because. There is no redevelopment agency and that goes straight to the general fund. That $8 million was programed into the fiscal year 2014 budget to pay for police, fire, parks and rec libraries and things like that. So it is gone. There are no excess funds. The money is anticipated to be spent in 2015 and 16 to solve our budget problems. As you know, we presented a three year budget look see, and those funds are committed to that. If indeed the city council chose not to fund police, fire parks and rec libraries with our general fund dollars and put it someplace else, that definitely would put us into a deficit for those two years. Thank you. Mr.. As you conclude custom membership scheme. Have yours from I first of all I would like to thank city staff. I know they have been extremely diligent working on this housing element, but I also want to thank the people that have come tonight and they've come here diligently themselves. And I, I think what Kerry said is very important, that I would hope that all of the parties here in this room, pro con on a housing element, understand what Kerry Gallagher said. And that is everybody is on the same side. Everybody wants to make housing in this city what it needs to be, and that is to be able to have it available for everyone who needs it. One of the things McKinsey and Company has just done an interesting report about how to make a city great. And they looked around the world and they talked to mayors of all these major cities and the cities that have transformed themselves, among other things, did smart growth. But they also looked and took care of. They focused in on those who weren't doing as well as everyone else in the city and because they felt equal justice for all. And that included about housing was extremely important to the quality of life in that city. And those cities have turned themselves around. So I there were some comments made tonight that I think we need to be very sensitive about that the people who live in what we call affordable housing, which in California is actually kind of an oxymoron, it's very unaffordable in California, Southern California, particularly to be able to buy a house, particularly with the economy being it is, and that people are not having the salaried jobs that they once had. So I think we need to make certain that when we cast aspersions on the category of calling affordable housing, that we're not casting aspersions on the people who live in that kind of housing. These are the people we have to remember who serve you in the restaurants, who are cleaning your hotel, who are taking care of your kids and landscaping your homes. And they need a place to live in Long Beach. And I think we need to be as sensitive as possible, understanding that to be able to have people included in a housing element that includes everyone I think is important to the city of Long Beach. It means that we want to move forward together as a city. I would say about the code enforcement, the RE program. I would hope I know staff has a lot of things on their plate, but I also know this council, when it wants to move forward and get something passed, it does quickly, as we're going to see later tonight on some some issues. But I would hope that we do seriously look at the program and maybe misspoke. I know you talked about 10,000 code enforcement complaints, and I think about 5000 of them come from my office. But Kitty, I saw Angela shaking her head up and down over there, sort of. Yeah. But I will tell you, in my district, we have never yet had a complaint about inhabitable housing from a person who rents or lives in some place. So what? I do think that code enforcement can be a valuable tool. We have the laws on the books. We, you know, and I and I know your department is just fastidious about responding to these concerns. So I'm wondering if there's in some way, while you're investigating this program, if we can't get it communicated to tenants and others, that code enforcement is a phone number that they should call. If, in fact, because I know that most of the time that the response to 5 to 7 code, I know that most of the time that it staff's very diligent about not indicating the source of the call, but simply investigating the complaint. And although some people can pretty much piece something together if it's coming from an inhabitable situation, I would just hope that somehow the city can do some more outreach to let people know that this is available. Understood. We do have a education program that we do in conjunction with our multifamily housing inspection program, but there is always room for improvement. And so we can certainly look at making that much more robust as part of this effort. And on the question about Mr. Rosen, about sources of funding down the line. Actually, I've had this same discussion that not to refer to any of these funding. It's boomerang. Nothing's coming back. This is simply tax increment that we should have realized if we hadn't. Redevelopment agencies are coming back from any source is basically, isn't it? It's the additional tax increment that we hadn't had for the years. So I'm wondering, you mentioned that and actually I didn't know we had 16 million. Is there any way staff could provide at some point a certain kind of a breakdown? I know you verbally said where the source is that money came from, but. Not only that, but perhaps where we think it's going to be utilized. I mean, what's down the line? I think that needs to be communicated in the public that we've got the source of funding and where are we going with it? Cuts were certainly the report that Amy did certainly listed the funding, but certainly a little. Bit more of a narrative, I think would certainly for that, certainly addressing only that particular thing. Right. Sources and uses. No problem. Thank you. Councilmember Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I wanted to thank all of the members that did come today and for your continued advocacy and participation in this process. Mr. Grech, I, I know you've heard from other Council members on the issue of substandard housing. I want to share, I think between the first and second districts we probably have more than what code enforcement is officially aware of, which tells me that renters do fear the risk of being evicted. The handful of folks that I know that have complained about substandard housing had been evicted even though they contacted the city. We don't have the ability to protect individuals from eviction. That's not the sign authority that we have. It's not something that we're even able to promise. And so even anonymity doesn't guarantee that. And that's the challenge, because traditionally renters and residents don't go straight to the city. They do try to exhaust all of their resources and they try to work with the manager and the landlord. And so that becomes a way to identify yourself as having had that particular issue. So having said that, I do want to share that I concur with council members here that have suggested that there are parts of our city where housing is not up to standard and up to code, and we're aware of that. And we are a limited resourced city. And so if there are opportunities to identify additional resources to address that very specific issue, specifically because about 50% of our residents are renters and that's 50% of this city's residents. And so it's important to ensure that we address that we have great housing that's come online. And many of the individuals that spoke tonight are beneficiaries of that. And and I'm happy for that. But at the same time, acknowledging the progress that we make cannot be done by denying some of the challenges that we still have. So we do have these challenges, and I want to make sure that I express my support to expedite the rental escrow program review and at least earlier than what was previously stated. But I do think staff had just committed to that, bringing it within the 2014 year, and I appreciate that. With that, I wanted to just share my support for the points that have been advocated tonight. I do think that this document is significant and important enough to be sure that we do provide that roadmap for a optimistic future for those of us who don't live in the housing that we deserve to live in. Thank you. Mr. DeLong. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. You know, I think it's a good discussion this evening. Thank you all for your participation. I think this process has definitely improved the final product. And I've heard some good suggestions tonight behind the rail as well for for staff to continue to see if you can make it even better and improve some of the timeframes. And with that, I'll make the motion to approve the recommendation. Second building, second Astrodome. Actually, I think it's all been said. Thank you. Covered. Well, I think it has to, Mr. Vice Mayor. Best. Mr. NEIL. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I would like to just add a friendly amendment to that in regard to the ordinance, if we could get a time certain that they could report back to us by December of 2014. And I have one major concern with this. The major concern is in regards to the actual funding that is going to be dedicated into affordable housing. I would like to propose that we do 10% of the property tax funds dedicated annually. That's not a friendly amendment. That's that's something. That's apparently I mean, it's only you're going to get you're. Going to get my vehement opposition to that. So. Well, if the if the makers of. All property tax, you realize how much that is how much is oh, it's a lot of money. It's our major source of funding. How is it $10 million or something? And it was probably more than that was property tax producer 60 million or something like that. Something like this. Okay, I'm changing it from property. I In regards to the funding that we were discussing in regards to the Boomerang four. Can I just try to just try to talk about this? Mr. Neal Yes. Mr. Neal These are not boomerang funds. These. The only. Reason we have more money. Is because redevelopment is dissolved. The incremental tax that was frozen is now removed. So the reason we have more money, quite frankly, is from success of redevelopment. From added property tax values that are now taxed at that full amount. That's what's coming into the city. If you take 1.6 million or 20% of this this additional increment, you're going to have to find 1.6 million to fill a budget hole. And I just think that after what we've been through, that is given the fact that you don't even know how much is coming in for housing, to me that is not a fruitful endeavor. I do share your concern there, Mayor. You do. But I also believe that we have to have some dedicated funding source to make sure that we do meet the need for over. A year coming in. You have 16 million a year. Let's make your motion. Let's go. Come on. Well, my motion is to definitely include the report back on the report in December. And I need some kind of dollar figure for the affordable housing piece. I think you were talking about 20% of the 8 million. That would be 1.6 million. So that you that's where you would be. And you just created a hole in your budget. Mr. Moore. I think Councilmember O'Neill is talking about what are what are the existing funds that are coming out of this bodak. Could you just. If that's what you mean, that's can we can we take what they can get by the time certain? But Mr. Botha, can you talk about you said. Well, I think he's he's evolved. If I can respond. Can you repeat the funds that we have? Yeah, go ahead, Amy. Okay. So we're going to try this. The housing fund is a dedicated fund within the city that you annually include in your budget process, but it is not part of the general fund. Currently, there's $16.8 million in cash today in the housing fund that we've been accumulating. That includes additional bond proceeds. That includes home funds, condo conversion fees, coastal and lieu fees, a bunch of other things. Additionally, the downtown project area city manager West stated. Owed the. Housing fund approximately a $16.3 million. You, as successor agency, approved a repayment schedule to to repay the housing fund that $16.3 million. We will be shortly. Coming to you with an additional request to reinstate $8.1 million in debt, a new debt to the housing fund. So that would bring it to 16.8 plus 16.3 plus 8.1. Lastly, the city. Has debt that it is owed that the redevelopment agency owes the city under AB 1484 the dissolution. Rules. When the city reestablishes. That debt, which is approximately $110 million, 20% of all of the debt repayment must be set aside for affordable housing. So if I add those numbers up, Amy, is 40 million plus 22 million that close? Correct. Plus, we have. The annual. Housing authority money that we get it approximately 79, $80 million a year. So I do. Want to make sure that this housing fund dollars that we're talking about is for the production and rehabilitation of affordable housing. But we do have other resources to assist, you know, challenged, you know, families with challenged incomes. It's not just these dollars. You know, we have a whole very significant functioning housing authority that that operates, you know, 7000 assists, 7000 families a year in addition to these dollars. So it is. Inaccurate to say that there will not be a continuous stream while that debt is out there. There will be a stream of revenues that is going to the housing fund and that is guaranteed under AB 1480 for the redevelopment dissolution. Under under what you just laid out, that's like $65 million over over the course of how, how long. We think it could take anywhere from 3 to 10 or 15 years to do that. We cannot estimate the time frame at this point. So there's there's no dedicated amount that's going to go back. And. Well, we know that we have 65 million coming. That is correct. Okay. So now my motion reads that I want the report and it's to be presented, the amendment, the report, and it's presented to the City Council for Consideration and Adoption by December 2014. Can you accept that, Mr. Dorn? Yeah, well, we're looking for staff to finish their analysis and bring to the council by December 14. Mr. Mayor. Council members, what's in the House amount for us is to come back with an analysis. Councilmember Neal said to come back with an ordinance for approval. That's not what we're proposing in the in the. Yeah, no. We want to see the analysis before we know if we're going to move forward with an ordinance. We're asking staff to make sure they do that by December 4th. Direction from the council. Once you see the analysis, we certainly could come back with the ordinance. But I think we're on the same page. We're okay with that? Yep. Okay. So amended. All right. Mr. Chair. Thank you. I just want to add one. Well, and I'm going to support what's what's put before us. But I do want to add one other thing. I do think, though, as a city, we have to understand the and realize that when RDA was eliminated that we did lose an incredibly important source of funding for us when it comes to housing. So I think I think as a city, that's something we have to recognize. And I would encourage us and if you and I had this discussion today, which I think went well on this topic during our budget discussions, which I think are going to be happening very soon, I mean, we're going to be start talking about the budget here in just a few months. But I do think that we need to have a thoughtful community discussion about our new budget in the way that it's going to be presented in funding that we're going to be receiving in a different way this year than in past redevelopment and have a discussion about . What part of that budget, if any, is also going to be dedicated to our housing needs? And so I think that that discussion should happen within the framework of the of the larger budget. The reality is, is that we don't have, in my opinion, a a complete plan when it comes to how we're going to fund future housing needs, whether they're affordable workforce housing for graduate students, faculty housing, all the different types of of housing that's out there that we're going to need as a community. And so I would encourage this as a as a council that we should prioritize the discussion of of funding for housing as part of the budget cycle and for us to do it early on in the year. And so I'm going to ask that of, of the Council and I'm hopeful that we can have that discussion sooner rather than later. That's remember. LOWENTHAL Let's try to bring this to conclusion, folks. Just briefly, I wanted to acknowledge what Councilmember Neal raised. I understand what you were raising and where you're coming from, and I would support us having that discussion through the budget process. Mr.. Orson. Council member in. I was reading my mind. I think the budget process is an appropriate place or a venue to have that discussion. As I recall, we set a number of policies last year and one Councilmember Johnson was pretty instrumental in championing and that was a policy to set aside a certain percentage of future one times toward unfunded liabilities. I think we could look at doing a similar policy for low income or affordable housing, and so I'm happy to have that conversation during the budget process as well. Mr. Johnson. Well, thank you, Mayor. I think all of us here support affordable housing, but I do think there's a philosophical issue here, which is that if we were to take general fund dollars and put them in to low income housing, what we would be doing is reducing funding for parks, libraries, firefighters, etc.. And I think the issue there is those things all have their own needs, but particularly for people, low income folks. Right. Low income folks typically need the public safety protection benefit from recreation programs because they may not be able to afford going to the country club benefit libraries because they can't just go to bars in mobile and buy whatever book they want. So you basically reduce those programs and hurt. This group of poor folks. To put money over here for low income housing, I don't think benefits the city, and I also don't think it even benefits people we'd be trying to benefit. So I do support affordable housing. I think the state did the wrong thing, ending redevelopment funds, which was the primary source. But to reduce firefighter spending, to reduce parks and library spending, and to make those low income communities suffer, I don't think is the answer. Thank you. All right, members, we have a motion and a second on on the motion to adopt the housing element as presented with Mr. Neill's friendly amendment, please cast your votes. Motion carries nine votes. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. All participate. Appreciate it. Okay. We're going to just take one item out of order. Going to go to item 23. Mr. Austin assures me there are people have been waiting a long time. 23 and 23 is a recommended recommendation to declare in order to maintain.","Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing, adopt resolution approving the 2013-2021 Housing Element as part of the City’s General Plan, authorize its submittal to the State Department of Housing and Community Development; authorize Director of Development Services to submit the adopted Housing Element to the California Coastal Commission for a finding of conformance with the Certified Local Coastal Program; and Certify the Negative Declaration ND 03-13.

I believe that Council Bill 20 1053 be placed upon final consideration. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the re cry. The required public hearing for council bill 5 to 3 is open. May we please have the staff report and we have Edson here. Good evening, counsel. My name is Ed Banyas and I'm with Community Government. Before you today we have 945 North Irving Street. It's currently on Eastside and the requesting Eastside one, which is a single unit zone district and the requesting for a single unit zone district with an accessory dwelling units. So the the site is located in Council District three and fourth District in Villa Park neighborhood. And the site itself is just over 6000 square feet. It's a single unit residential structure and the request is to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. And you. The current zoning is ESU D, which is a single unit zone district to the north. You see ESU, D1 X, which is a single unit zoned district that allows for an accessory dwelling unit as well as E.R. 2.5, which is a row house up to 2.5 storeys in height and directly to the south. You already see an ESU, D1, which is a single unit zone district allowing for an accessory dwelling unit. The land use is single unit residential. It's predominantly single unit residential in the area with some two unit and motel unit scattered in open space to the north right next to the trunk station. And then the property itself is on the upper left corner. It's a the property is very pushed back. So the vegetation doesn't allow you to actually see the structure, but you can see the front of that property. And then you can see in the overall it's one story structures in proximity to this site. So went before the planning board in May and it was approved unanimously and it's before you today. And so far as a president, we've only received one letter of support and it is attached to the staff report. Whenever we have a rezoning, there are specific review criteria that we look at from the Denver zoning code. So there are five, and the first one is Kansas City with adopted plans. And we're focusing on three specific plans which are comprehensive plan 2040 blueprint in Denver, a language in transportation plan of 2019 and as well as the Villa Park Neighborhood Plan of 1991. So there are several strategies found in comprehensive plan 2040 that the proposed rezonings consistent with that are specified in the staff report. And I would jump into your blueprint in Denver. Groups in Denver classify this area as urban edge, which is predominately residential. When we look at the place type, it's classified as low, medium residential, which offers a mix of low and mid-scale multi-unit residential options. And for the street type classification for North Irving, Street is a local street which is primarily served by residential uses. When we dove into the neighborhood plan, the Villa Park plan of 1991, their specific strategy and language in this plan that talks about specifically strategy to to discourage development that is incompatible with this the scale and quality of the neighborhood as well as having a it does talk about having a housing vision expressed in the plan that is strong and vital residential neighborhood to increase the rate of home ownership, renovate and maintain housing as well as strategy each one a which is enhance the appearance in the quality of the neighborhood housing. As well as the rezoning meets the other review criteria specified in the staff report. Therefore, CPD recommends, based on all the findings of the review criteria have been met and staff is available for any questions you may have as well as it is here as well online. Thank you. All right. Thank you, edson. And this evening, we have one individual signed up to speak on this hearing, and it's Jesse Paris. Go ahead, please, Jesse. You can speak, Jesse. We're trying to get you into the queue, Jesse. I think you're going to have to unmute yourself. Jesse, we're going to have to have you unmute yourself, please. All right. It seems that we're having some problems. We can't, unfortunately. Jesse isn't. Amusing himself. And so we're going to, unfortunately, need to go ahead and move on. We've tried. Everything that we can. And so we're going to go ahead and continue on with the hearing. We want to allow any questions from members of council on a council bill 5 to 3. Counsel Pro Tem Torres. Thank you, Madam President. Hey, Edson. I'm going to follow up with a question, but I'm wondering if we have the applicant in queue, Mr. Salas, or is he in chambers now? I believe the applicant should be in the queue. And so it's Willie Salas. I have been tell. Of Mr. Salazar and the meeting. Hi, Mr.. Silas. Hi. I'm to asked the property. Owners. And we've talked about your current house that it sits way at the back of your property. What's your plan for building your edu? Right now, it's in very much the conceptual phase. I don't have any. Guidelines that I can really communicate or speak on right now. As you know, the pricing of construction materials is very high right now. So I don't have any immediate plans for what it would look like. But I can tell you that I look forward to taking advantage of this new rezoning and adding an 80 in the rear. And that's basically as much as I can say. In 80, you in the rear would mean demolishing the current primary house. Right. Which is at the rear of the property. Yeah. I think the plan is to demolish the almost 100 year old section of the primary house. Yes. Thank you so much. It's just a question for you really quickly whether or not this is a. Um. What Mr. Salis builds. He's allowed to build, attached or detached on the property, right? Correct. What changes or does anything change if it's an attached edu when it comes to bulk plane? Maximum height, that kind of thing. Cause I recall that the rear had a lower height than the primary. In a detached situation, what happens with an attached. So in an attached situation. And. There's setback requirements that he would have to rear set back requirements that he'd have to meet into any situation. He doesn't meet that. So he would have to work with development services to figure out exactly. But the code is very specific for this stone district that says in the rear the maximum allowed is 19 feet. If it's an attach and if it was detached, it would be 24 feet. And so in this scenario, he would have to follow those guidelines. On foot attached. Okay. That's all I had. No additional questions. Thank you, Madam President. All right. Thank you, counsel pro Tem Torres and Councilmember Sawyer. I thought I'd seen you up, but maybe your question got answered. It got answered? Yep. Thanks. All right. Great. Thank you. All right, so you. No other questions from members of council. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 5 to 3, Council Pro Tem Torres. Thank you, Madam President. I just really want to extend thanks to Mr. Salas for approaching our office early today, just to let us know what he was working on. He got ahead of our conversation by probably about a year because we're looking to reason this entire section through our multi neighborhood rezoning. So your neighbors will have the same permission. As you, Mr. Salas. If this does go through. But I just appreciate the communication from the applicant with myself, as well as the R.A. and their neighbors. I look forward to supporting tonight. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Counsel Pro Tem Torres, and I am happy to support this as well, seeing that it meets all of the rezoning criteria.

Councilmember Black, will you please put Council Bill six, five, nine on the floor for final passage?","A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 945 North Irving Street in Villa Park.

My motion carries unanimously. Thank you. The next item that was pulled is five F and I pulled that because I wanted to give Alameda point an opportunity actually to share with the public. And I see Rachel in the audience here. But but this is is phase zero a years one and two of what did happen at Alameda Point and what is anticipated to happen in the this coming year. And I think it's important that we share that with our public. Rachel, did you want to say anything? I'm happy to actually would encourage people to go to the point alameda on Facebook and like that. That's where they do post events and they are very strong using social media. But I really want to make sure the public's aware of what's happening there. So this is your opportunity. Thank you so much, Madam Mayor, and members of Council, and I appreciate the opportunity to get together this evening and share an update on our Phase Zero program. Mm. Is this in our materials? Mm. Mm. Yes. It's on the consent calendar. And if you could also highlight your two, because that's where you can make sure everyone's aware of what you're doing. Absolutely. So just to recap, some of the objectives that we are working towards is trying to increase awareness about the project, attract new audiences out to Alameda Point and generate some buzz not only here within the community, but also on a regional basis. So a quick recap of some of the events that we hosted. We really try to work hard to appeal to a wide variety of audiences, from families up to adults and teens. So a couple of quick photos because they can tell a better story than I can of some of the events that we've hosted. This has spanned the gamut from a coastal cleanup on Martin Luther King Day, partnering with the Parks and Rec team on the Clay Herding skateboard tournament, as well as a new street festival that we brought out to Alameda Point, which was called Whimsy Fest. I also wanted to mention that, you know, we had over 14 different events with 11,000 attendees, and we generated some great new partnerships that have brought in new audiences. And we are hoping to continue to have those partnerships continue on through the next year. So. One of the things that we learned through the first year is that we really need to have a home for phase zero. We need to have it there a place that our traffic can grow organically. And we also need to maintain flexibility. So as new programs and new partnerships come up, we can work those into into the Phase zero program. So looking into year two, we're very excited to finally have our home start to come together. This is going to be in front of the Naval Air Museum, some area that we chose very carefully, which has enabled us to tap into some existing infrastructure, be in close to the heart of where there are a lot of audiences currently today, and also steer clear of our Phase one construction, which is kicking off very, very soon. So this home for phase zero is going to include a artfully designed container village. This is designed by the same team that has brought together the yard in San Francisco, which is across the street from Park Bell Park, which has been very, very successful and will bring a new cafe and beer garden and new opportunities for people to enjoy the site's natural attributes of beautiful views of San Francisco, as well as the waterfront, which is an underutilized part of the base right now. So we're going to be reusing some of the murals that were part of Whimsy Fest, and those are going to be brought out. And so that Container Project is going to be the home for our Year two activity calendar. So that includes the return of the pumpkin patch, which brought us 6000 people last year. It will also serve as the home for the American Armed Forces Cup, which is going to come back for a second year. That was a great way to honor our veterans and support the history at Alameda Point. I want to add, the public is very welcome to attend. That is not just for our military and it's a wonderful event. Glad that glad that it was well enjoyed. And now that we will have a home, it will make it a lot easier for us to also have smaller recurring events. So a couple of ideas that we have put on the calendar for next year have included things like Yappy Hour, which is an opportunity to bring your dog out and enjoy, enjoy the scenery as well as outdoor yoga and things like that. So I'm going to breezed through these really quickly. So as I mentioned, we brought back the pumpkin patch, which did very well this year. Again, despite a very rainy October, the American Armed Forces cap. The first one happened in October of this year and just had a first planning meeting for 2017. Skip through the next one. So we will be bringing back a coastal cleanup during Martin Luther King weekend. A point of transition. This was an opportunity to invite a number of artists into some of the buildings that are going to be either torn down or renovated during phase one. So that has already happened. And now we are working on a creative show that will highlight the makers and the creativity out at Alameda Point, which will also include a show of a number of these photographs as well. As a way to enjoy all of the waterfront access that we have. Plans for doing a paddling event. Then come April will be the grand opening of the The Container Project, as well as a return of the Creative Arts Festival. Clay Harding skateboard tournament is on our calendar as well. And then some of the recurring events that we hope will be successful and we can bring back frequently would be outdoor movies. Yappy Hour. And then the outdoor yoga. And so these would be some of the programs that would be happening within the Container Project. So very excited to have a fruitful in the next year. And where do people find you on social media. It is Facebook dot com slash the point. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. I do. We have a motion. So moved. Second. All those in favor. All right. I unanimously. Thank you. I also polled 5ga recommendation to authorize the city manager to amend the Hornet Field Lease License Agreement with the Alameda Soccer Club to include operation and maintenance of the adjacent tennis courts. Four additional soccer field space. And this one, I was hoping that staff could clarify what's going to be happening with the tennis courts out there and what exactly this is amending. Go ahead. Thanks. Good evening, Mayor and Council. My name is Amy Wooldridge. I'm the Recreation and Parks Director. To clarify what we are doing, I've been working with the Alameda Soccer Club, which came to my cellphone and brought to the Recreation and Parks Commission a proposal to renovate the dilapidated tennis courts that are there that are adjacent to the Hornet field, which they currently have a license agreement with the city, a five year agreement that expires in February 2019. What we are proposing is that we that the soccer club be allowed to improve those tennis courts into an interim use. That would be a football type, but a rubberized potential rubberized surface similar to a tennis court surfacing that they then could use for all other play and additional practice space. Again, it's an interim use, which is why we included it as part of the Hornet field lease license agreement so that the use of those tennis courts would be tied to it and could be looked at and reviewed each time the Hornet field license agreement came up for renewal. Are there plans to have tennis courts on the west end of town as part of our community parks? It's not determined yet. Ultimately, we roughly have called that Enterprise Park. It's the triangle area from that basically stretches from about where the Hornet field is out to the internal boat launch facility. And when we have that, the scope and the bandwidth to do so, LAPD would Alameda Recreation Park Department would engage the community in a masterplan process to determine what the community wants to see out there, whether they want to see tennis courts there, or whether we only have tennis courts at the sports complex. There's a lot of master planning to be done out at Alameda Point in for recreation facilities. Are there plans to have tennis courts at the sports complex then? Potentially. But we'll be doing a master plan process for that as well. All right. So currently our tennis court, public tennis courts are only available at Creasey Park. Oh, no, we have. Where else are they? Washington are our largest complexes at Washington. We have them at Lydecker. We have them at Cruisy. We have one single court that now is being used as pickleball courts at Lincoln Park. I feel like I'm missing one. Longfellow. Thank you. And Franklin, the audience is a very good number with the courts are. Always on now. Not so much anymore as what I've heard. Okay, so we do have speakers on this item. Thank you very much. Thank you. Chris Neal. Eugene Demler. Ebola. Ebola. John Paxson. David something. And Scott McCaskill. Chris. You want to go first? You may have up to 3 minutes, but you don't have to take it all. Thank you very much. As many of you know, I was coaching a special needs soccer team this fall. Children with severe mental challenges and physical challenges. With 15 children on their team. We templated the program on the Challenger baseball program. That Little League. And then I assisted a very impressive young man by the name of Easton Woon, who had arranged he's a high school student. He'd arranged with other high school students to provide a similar experience, not competitive, but for younger children. On Saturdays, he and his friends had arranged this, and they've grown it to 30 special needs children. So between our two programs, we have 45 children who are participating. What the army, the soccer club is doing is highly valuable and helpful to us for a number of reasons. First, in the group that I work with, we have a real issue with children taking off and running. These tennis courts are fenced in. So right now we are limited in the number of children we can serve by our number of volunteers. We have to go 1 to 1, one body to one player. Being able to get inside of an enclosed area makes it much, much more manageable. Second, it's a somewhat isolated location, and many of our autistic children become very agitated by noise. So when we're playing on a soccer field where there are other players and other games going on and there's cheering and screaming, so children cover their ears and run off. So being isolated is helpful. Not to mention most of the other fields where we have soccer really don't have many handicapped parking spaces. There's a lot of parking out here which would solve a problem for us. But most importantly, it's a hard, smooth surface which makes it easier for our non-ambulatory players, the players with Down syndrome, the players who are in wheelchairs or walkers who frankly, we couldn't serve this year. So I implore you to let the soccer club spend some money and do this. Thank you very much. We appreciate all the. Thank you, Eugene. Madam Mayor and council members. My name is Eugene Demler. I've been a Alameda resident for 15 years. I'm a business owner in the city of Alameda, and I also have two boys that attend Alameda schools. For the last ten years, I have been involved with Alameda Soccer Club as both a coach in various volunteer capabilities. And then most recently, for the last two years, I've been the president of the organization. This is for those who aren't aware, this is a club of approximately 1300 kids. We are a community based organization. We are solely volunteer based. We don't there's nobody paid on staff. So this club is run by the by the citizens of Alameda. And we're looking for your approval to be able to extend that outreach to the to the to other people in the in the community.",Recommendation to Approve Phase Zero Year 1 Annual Update and Phase Zero Year 2 Activity Plan for Site A at Alameda Point.

Celebrating the Colorado Convention Centers 25th anniversary. Whereas in 1987, the Denver City Council approved funding for the design and construction of the Colorado Convention Center and in partnership with the Colorado Legislature, which approved purchase of the land. Ground was broken on for the center in 1988 and opened in June. 1990 is the 10th largest convention center in America. Where is the building was designed in a way that it could accommodate expansion. And in November 1999, Denver voters approved an increase in the lodgers and car rental tax to expand the center. It is worth noting that the architect's design included input from more than 200 national meeting planners, and that no doubt made it a better center. Whereas in 2002, the groundbreaking for the center expansion set a world record as the largest groundbreaking in history with more than 4000 participants. Yes, and I was one of them. And it was indeed crowded in 2004. Open is the largest public building in Colorado. 2 million square feet. And. Whereas, in 2008, Denver voters approved that increase in the largest tax for funds to increase tourism and convention marketing. And in since that time, 2008, the investment has reaped rewards. In Denver's tourism and convention. Business has grown 48% compared to the national growth of only 15%. Where is the Colorado Convention Center? Is known nationally as one of the greenest convention centers in the country, being the first to meet the Accepted Practices Exchange Apex Standard in 2012 and improving its leadership in energy and environment design. LEED rating to gold in 2014. And. Whereas, The Convention Center is an economic engine for Denver, generating $500 million annually in local economic impact, employing 200 full time and more than 400 part time staff. Driving demand for downtown Denver's 9000 hotel rooms and welcoming nearly a million visitors in 2014. Whereas the CDC is known for its public art, including the center's favorite piece of public art, the Blue Bear. And. WHEREAS, The Convention Center is a hub of continuing education for diverse industries and professionals from around the United States and the world . Where is the convention center consistently places its professional reviews by meeting planners is one of the top ten convention centers in the nation. Now, therefore, be it or plain by the council, the city and county of Denver, Section one.

I hope that we will address this this proclamation this evening. Mr. President. It has been moved in seconding comments. Councilman Brown. Well, thank you again, Mr. President. I've been honored to serve on the Visit Denver board for more than a decade. You know, if you think about it, we've all seen the TV spots that celebrate the importance of fishermen and hunters to our rural areas. And their tagline on line is Hug a hunter. You know, when you walk in downtown and we are filled with convention, people here are there. They wear badges. You can't say hug a badger because, you know, that's Wisconsin and we're Colorado. But certainly certainly we should thank those individuals who are spending their time and money. And our city. So thank them when you see a badger around our city. And so I am grateful and thankful to be able to present this proclamation this evening and hope my colleagues will approve it. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Brown.

Thank you, Councilwoman Montero. Catwoman Ortega. Thank you. I want to thank Mayor Pena for having the vision of moving this forward in working with our state legislature. We saw that when the convention center first broke ground. We designed it so that we could add the second half later and a number of years later. We were successful in doing that and designing it so that our train system could go right through the center of it. And I also want to acknowledge colleagues that I served with who worked to place the issue on the ballot to expand the lodgers tax and thank the voters for their support in passing that that allowed part of those costs to to be covered. The work that our convention bureau does is incredible in terms of learning about all the different conventions that are out there that they could attract to this great city. And they do a phenomenal job in in bringing those visitors to this city and selling our city, our hotels or convention center . I don't know how many of you have been to Comic-Con.

We are now moving on to the next item, Madam Clerk. Item 16 Communication from Councilmember Pierce, Councilman Gonzales, Councilmember, your UNGA recommendation to request a report in no more than 90 days on the current oil and gas operations conducted in Long Beach. Council Member Pearce. Sorry, guys. Okay. I want to thank city staff and everybody for your time and the meetings that we've had to discuss this. I really wanted to make sure that we as speakers earlier said, don't just take a vote on supporting somebody in another state, but that we look internally about what we're doing. And so this is a simple report that's simply asking to make sure that we look at add new technologies to make sure our operations are safer and more sustainable. Many residents have told me that they feel in the dark about specifics about our safety operations, especially given recent incidences in Porter Ranch and 1986 pipeline accidents that killed more than 500 people, injured more than 4000, and cost nearly $7 billion in property damages. Much of this due to aging pipelines that have not been properly maintained. Given that drilling first started in 1920s, we want to be proactive and looking at infrastructure to know what's most impacted, what the risks are. And so today, what I'm simply asking for is a report from city staff on where our pipelines are, the integrity of them, what safety precautions we've taken in the past to make sure that we're capping off oil derricks. And what is a process that community members can look to or transparency to ensure that they know where these pipelines are and what our community is doing. So it's a simple report back in 90 days and I'm asking for council support in this. Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Yes, thank you. I just wanted to reiterate everything Councilmember Pearce said. I think we have received a lot of, you know, information and questions as to much of the pipelines, especially in light of what's happened. And so I know in addition to the pipelines, we would also like to see maybe a report and list of abandoned wells in Long Beach, particularly those that have may not have modern abandonment standards. My best I believe there was an issue with the Gerald Desmond Bridge where it cost us a bit more and also a considerable amount of time as well. So I think, Councilmember Pearce, for bringing this forward, I look forward to hearing more information and what we can do with that information going forward. Thank you. Councilmember Ringo. Thank you, Rosemary. I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this forward. It's very timely beginning of the year. As many of you know, I serve on the Coastal Commission and there were a couple of spills last year, repeal one of them. And as a result of that, I asked last year for a report on where we're at with it, with our infrastructure, with our pipes. I don't know what happened to it. It got lost. They're glad you brought it back, because it is important that we know what what's in our infrastructure. There's a big piece of property. For example, in my district, the oil operators, where there's a lot of abandoned pipelines underneath that don't contain water, some contain oil. But I'd like to know what exactly what's underneath there so that when we look at what types of possibilities and possible developments that are going to be taking place there , if at all, what is it exactly we're dealing with in those areas? So I'm glad you brought this forward and I'm looking forward to the report. Thank you. The public comment, please. Anna Christensen of Long Beach, California. I have a couple of requests. One, that this same report, should this motion pass, be brought in before the Sustainability Commission as well? Since the. Sustainability Commission has taken such a great role in looking at options for new technology and a greener Long Beach, it only makes sense that they have an opportunity to also ask questions or. Hear this report directly from. City staff in addition. I would really appreciate an amendment to this report that included any drilling projects that are proposed that are, in other words, that already have either an air or an initial study because weather that they could very likely happen. So they seem to be worth review. And I'm specifically speaking about the Lost Cerritos Wetlands Restoration and Oil Consolidation Project, which proposes to put 120 new oil wells on either side of our active earthquake fault in our wetlands, as we are also proposing a possibility of 6000 new residences there. This is really. You know, important that we take a look at what does this mean? We know that it means that eventually old oil wells, abandoned oil wells that are apparently bursting into flames over there are going to get taken out. That's a good thing. But what's the risk? What is the risk of drilling 120 new wells right next to an earthquake? If we're interested in what our what our status is in terms of public safety and a green city, I hope that that at least that one project would be included, that staff could take a look at it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. Thank you. My name's Ellie Gonzales. As I previously mentioned, I'm the current chair of the Sustainability Commission. And as the previous speaker speaker just mentioned, I do believe that this fits within the purview of the commission. This is an item actually we have actually reviewed about a year ago. And what I'd like to do is just simply update the commission with new information as as it was mentioned by the council member, we had a major gas leak. This was the largest gas leak in history. Within my lifetime. I've seen the biggest oil spill in my in in my lifetime. And as well as the biggest gas leak, I think that we are living on a crumbling infrastructure. And I and for that reference, I would like to invite you all to check out The O.C. Weekly. What the frak is happening under Long Beach. There's a quote in there that says that Long Beach is sitting on a ticking time bomb. That's that's a quote given by a geologist. I think I take this very seriously for those who know me. No, I like to have fun. I really enjoy Long Beach. But when it comes to our environment, our air and our water, I take these issues quite seriously. I believe that each of you council members deserve to know all the information that I have been researching on my own. You, a few of you, you have told me, Oh, we're not fracking in Long Beach. Are you aware that we're acid diving? Because I just received an AQ, M.D. notice while I was here in this meeting saying that they're going to acids on the terms islands. Are you familiar with what acid izing is? And if you don't know, you deserve to know and your constituents deserve to know. So I humbly ask that this body will allow our committee to review this item as well. And what we'd like to do is give our comments as a commission so that you all are well informed. And we'd also help like to help with vetting a lot of the public comments. I'm sure it's going to be a really long meeting, much like we've seen today. So we'd like to assist in receiving some of that feedback. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Thank you very much for listening this late in the evening. This is the item that I'm most excited about. I'm Patricia Chen and with Long Beach 350. And we are delighted that the city council is considering looking into oil and gas operations. We would like you to look for a way to cease operating the wells and pipelines that and crisscross our city and to keep oil and gas, gas in the ground. The reasons are that, first of all, it's great timing. The price of gas and oil are going down. So it's a good time to seek solutions and other revenue sources to wean our city off fossil fuel revenues. Also because of the climate. Long Beach is very vulnerable to climate change because we have a long coast, which means we have businesses and homes and our port at sea levels. And also because of what the extraction, the nature of the extraction is in the city, um, uh, basically it's only tertiary extraction that will get anything out anymore. And that means using hazardous acids and basically poisons that are affecting the, um, the land and the rivers and the oceans here in Long Beach. Um, and finally, because aging pipelines are susceptible to leaks and fires and explosions, and they're just basically a liability. Um, so those are our thoughts as Long Beach 350 but there are so many other perspectives. And so I think that's why it would be a great idea for the Sustainable City Commission to hear the report and ensure that there is, um, a broad perspective and um, so that the report can be shaped and formed into something that doesn't just sit on the shelf. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Just when you think you saw the last and still another. I wanted to finish with something before, and so I'm going to start with it. These are some words from a gentleman who is no longer with us. It's Mother Earth has been abused. The powers have been abused. This cannot go on forever. No theory can alter that simple fact. Mother Earth will retaliate. The whole environment will retaliate. And the abusers will be eliminated. Things come full circle back to where they started. That's revolution. Those are the words of Russell Means. Russell Means was an Oglala Lakota Sioux. He was born on Pine, the Pine Ridge Reservation, and he was very outspoken as an activist for the environment. And I'm not a big environmentalist, except in my old age. I retired from the oil and gas equipment and repair and service industry, spent 35 years looking at the worst of the worst. And I can tell you, we're we're we're surrounded by it. I would not give a gloom and doom thing because we work. Really hard to make sure. Everything stays in control. There's some good people out there with good intents, but time takes its toll on everything and everybody. And those wells, it's only a matter of time. Thank you. Next week, please. Hi. My name is Elizabeth LAMB. I live in the third district and I'm here speaking as an individual, but I'm speaking as an individual that spent 40 years interested in environmental issues and advocating for the environment. And to me, to assess the gas and oil operations infrastructure of Long Beach just makes good sense. We all know that. Oil is a toxic substance. And it is important that the infrastructure around it be well-managed. And additionally, I also want to point out to you. That due to the many years of. Pumping oil in Long Beach, there may well be. Some. Subsidence issues. Related to that. Activity. That should also be looked at. As you all know, and as was. Articulated by the. Council members sponsoring this, oil spills can have devastating consequences both for the environment and also for the economy and beyond. So I encourage you to support this. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. Thank you. I just want to make two additional comments. I think that the idea to send it to the Sustainability Commission is definitely one that I'm open to and I hope that my colleagues will be open to that as well. I also wanted to include in the report, in addition to where our pipelines are, the health and integrity of those pipelines, what is our disaster preparedness should something happen? And three, I do want to say that I know that a lot of us would love to be off of oil, but obviously that's not going to happen any time soon. But how we can continue to raise awareness and support corporate partners that are really doing their best to get off of oil and be innovative in how they move forward. And so thinking about what are some of those technologies that we can continue to support and to have that conversation about how Long Beach is doing things like having charging stations for our green technology and things like that. So thank you. Councilman Austin. Thank you very much. And I'm going to be supportive of this item, I believe. I want to make sure we have some clarification on what we are asking the city manager to do as it reads. It says, Come back with a report in 90 days on the current oil and gas operations conducted in Long Beach. And the report shall include, but not limited to exploration drilling techniques, capping of oil wells, storage, pipeline maintenance and spill and other emergency preparedness. And then you want to to move this report offer this report to the Sustainability Commission as well. But there is no action after the 90 day report, correct? I think okay. Because I was hearing a whole lot here and I'm feeling really guilty that I'm going to put my keys in my car and leave now. Right. My gas. Pump. I have a big crew. Break. This evening. Take care. There's a motion and a second. Please cast your votes.","Recommendation to request City Manager to report to council in no more than 90 days on the current oil and gas operations conducted in Long Beach.

- Initiative proposed by Councilmembers Pearce and Gonzales to request a report within 90 days on Long Beach's current oil and gas operations

- Report should cover details like pipeline locations, integrity assessments, capping of old wells, storage facilities, maintenance procedures, and emergency preparedness plans

- Driven by public concerns over aging infrastructure, safety risks highlighted by recent incidents like the Porter Ranch gas leak and 1986 pipeline explosion 

- Aims to provide transparency to residents on the state of oil/gas assets, many dating back to 1920s drilling operations

- Proposal to also share report with the Sustainability Commission for their review and input, given their environmental focus

- Some speakers urged looking at phasing out oil/gas operations altogether and keeping remaining reserves in the ground to address climate change risks

- Others highlighted need to manage toxic substances and land subsidence carefully during/after extraction activities

- General consensus that a comprehensive assessment of Long Beach's legacy oil/gas infrastructure is prudent for public safety and environmental responsibility

I'll tell you tonight we have four public hearings for those who are participating in-person when called upon. Please come to the podium on the presentation monitor. On the wall you will see your time counting down for those participating virtually when called upon. Please wait until our meeting hosts promote you to speaker. When you are promoted, your screen will flash and say Reconnecting to meeting. Please don't leave the meeting. You will be reconnected and will need to turn on your camera if you have one. And your microphone. You will see your time counting down at the bottom of your screen. Once you have finished speaking, you will change back to participant mode and see your screen flash one more time. All speakers should begin their remarks by telling the council their names and cities of residence, and if you feel comfortable doing so, your home address. If you signed up to answer questions, only state your name and note that you are available for questions of counsel. Speakers will have 3 minutes. There is no yielding of time. If translation is needed, you will be given an additional 3 minutes for your comments to be interpreted. We will alternate between in-person and virtual for efficiency by calling in-person participants and then alternating to virtual participants. Speakers may stay on the topic of the hearing and must direct their comments to the council members. Please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to council as a whole and please refrain from individual or personal attacks. Councilmember Herndon, will you please put Council Bill 1321 on the floor for final passage? Yes, Madam President, I move that council bill 20 1-1, three, two, one. Be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. The required public hearing for Council Bill 1321 is open and I see we have Andrew Webb here with us for the staff report. Great. Thank you and good evening. And Andrew, because of the mask mandates in the city, we're going to ask that you keep your mask on for us this evening. Thank you for explaining. I didn't realize that. Yeah, no worries. Great. Well, thank you. Andrew Webb here from Community Planning and Development, presenting on this proposed map amendment for multiple properties in the East Colfax neighborhood from ESU, D X to E, cd1x. This proposed legislative map amendment is sponsored by Councilmembers Sawyer and Herndon, and it would result in all properties in the East Colfax neighborhood with single unit residential zoning so that accessory dwelling units or 80 use would be allowed. This map shows that the East Colfax neighborhood on both sides of Colfax is in council districts five and eight. This rezoning would impact about 2050 parcels or about 476 acres. And it would establish the the you as you are I'm sorry, the ESU, D1 that is the urban edge neighborhood context. That's a single unit zoned district allowing secondary dwelling units or accessory dwelling units. This map shows the existing zoning of the site as well as zoning of properties that are proximate to the site. As you can see, there have actually been most of the area zoned currently as huge. There have been a handful of property owner initiated rezonings already in the area to ESU D1 acts to allow to use zoning along Colfax as a main street zone district, allowing a mix of uses and then between the single unit areas and core facts. You do. We do see some higher intensity residential zoning like row house and two unit districts. Existing land use in the areas impacted by this rezoning are primarily single unit residential. As you can see here, there are also a handful of church and school type uses and an apartment. The slide shows some of the existing contexts, some of the built form that we would see in the East Colfax neighborhoods showing some typical single unit development on streets that would be impacted by this rezoning. And this slide shows some of the typical development that we would see along Colfax, adjacent to but outside this area of rezoning . So there has been quite a bit of public outreach done in advance of of even applying for this rezoning led by the the council districts, including mailers and fliers that were sent out earlier this year, early this year, in advance of two town halls that were held this year, and then an online survey that was in effect from August of last year. So 18, 20, 2020 to February of this year, once we receive the official application, information will notice went out in August of this year. Agency review, typically required of any rezoning occurred from August to September. And I'll just highlight here that we did hear from from Dottie Wastewater regarding some concerns around sewer capacity. And it has given us our department a great opportunity to be more intentional about how we work with Dottie to ensure that we're that their wastewater plans are are aligned with our our land use plans and the expected actual build out that comes from rezoning to allow ADA use. The other dates are shown here as well. The planning board hearing was held on on November 3rd and received unanimous recommendation of approval from planning board. And then this was considered by the ludy committee on November 9th. In terms of public comment, we have not received any comment from registered neighborhood organizations in the area, but we have received about five letters from neighbors and a letter from a local nonprofit organization. The Fact Partnership. In support of this proposed rezoning, we've also received three letters of opposition, and all of that written correspondence is included with the full staff report. I'll just highlight here and my colleague, a barge will be up later with another item on the agenda tonight. And that is a text amendment to address an error that was introduced into the Denver zoning code by the most recent bundle of text amendments that impacted the maximum building footprint for detached accessory dwelling units in some of the urban edge zone districts, including the one that's proposed here. So concurrent with this rezoning is a is a very targeted text amendment to the Denver zoning code to return that building form standard back to the original number. So as you're aware, to to adopt a legislative rezoning, the Council must find that the proposed rezoning is consistent with these three criteria from the Denver Zoning Code. With regard to adopted plans, there are four plans that impact the site the Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Blueprint. Denver. The East Area Plan, which was adopted last year and then I listed together is housing and inclusive Denver. But it's actually the five year housing plan more recently adopted guiding our our city's housing policy blueprint. Denver identifies this area as being within the urban edge context, so that makes using the urban edge or EA zone districts appropriate for this site is identified as a low residential area of future development, meaning we would predominantly see single and two unit uses in these areas and per blueprint. Accessory dwelling units are also appropriate in areas designated as low residential and a variety of street types serve the East Colfax area, including, of course, Colfax itself, which is a main street arterial. Several residential arterials go east and west through the site, and then Yosemite, I just would highlight, is identified as a commercial arterial and main street collector for nearby segments adjacent to the to the area. And then in terms of the blueprint Denver growth areas, this area, like most single unit districts, is identified as part of the all other areas of the city where we expect to see about 20% of housing growth by 2040. Story Blueprint. Denver also highlights several equity concepts that we analyze when considering rezonings as well. One of those is access to opportunity. This area generally has average access to opportunity. It does have high access to transit, of course, along Colfax and other parallel streets, and which gives good quality access into downtown and other areas of employment and day to day services. There are there is lower access to health care directly in the community, but it is accessible by transit. And this rezoning will increase housing opportunity and diversity of housing options in an area that has this existing great access to to transit. The East Colfax neighborhood is does come up as more vulnerable to involuntary displacement. So that includes a lower median household income, a higher percentage of renters, as compared to the city as a whole, and a lower level of educational attainment as compared to the city as a whole. This proposed rezoning will or could impact and improve the vulnerability to involuntary displacement by expanding housing options, providing some lower cost options to help keep residents in place and provide wealth building tools for existing property owners in East Colfax is Colfax has generally does have a diversity of housing types. There is a variety of of apartments in kind of smaller building forms duplexes four plex is a variety of of house sizes and dwelling unit sizes. And then housing costs are generally low and there actually are slightly more designated affordable housing units in this area than we would see elsewhere in the city. This proposed rezoning will allow additional advances in the expansion of housing diversity in the area by allowing a typically smaller and lower cost housing type. Finally, with regard to the diversity of jobs, most of the jobs in this area immediately surrounding or impacted by this proposed rezoning are retail oriented, and it's not expected that this rezoning will have an impact on the diversity of jobs in East Colfax. Our housing policies also call for rezoning and updating our regulations to to allow for a higher diversity of housing and expand accessory dwelling units. The East Area Plan identifies this area as also has a low residential area and identifies accessory dwelling units as as appropriate for this area. The East Area plan also has several policies that call for the expansion of of addus and other other housing options and ensuring that people have access to housing in areas that have good opportunities to access transit and day to day needs like like groceries and jobs and that sort of thing. With regard to the second criterion, this proposed rezoning will result in the uniform application of the ESU D1 Access Zone District in this location, the same regulations that would apply in that zone district elsewhere in the city, and it would further the public health, safety and welfare of neighbors by primarily by advancing and implementing our adopted plans for the East Colfax area. So with that, based on a finding that these review criteria have been met, Stapp recommends that city council approve this application, and I'm happy to answer any questions. All right. Very good. Thank you, Andrew. This evening, we have one individual signed up to speak on this hearing. We're going to go online to Jessie Parris. Even though my name is not represented for Black Stars, the Movement for Self-defense, Positive Action for Men for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Frontline Black Males. And I will be the next November 2023. I fight in District eight in Councilman Hardy's district. I'm in favor of this rezoning tonight. I support accessory dwelling units. When I ran for City Council At-Large in 2019, I still supported him, and in 2021 I still support them. So I'm in favor of this tonight. I would love to see all three dwelling units all over the city. So this is just one step in getting that accomplished. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 1321. The moment, Councilmember Ortega. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President. I'm not sure who this should be directed to, but I'm wanting to know if we are in any way as a city, looking at whether or not the affordability of creating more aid use is being addressed. Are we are we seeing these becoming more affordable or less affordable to people who are looking for permanent housing? Because as people are allowed to build in the EU, they can also use them as short term rentals. Right. Which kind of takes units off the market for people who are looking for permanent housing. So is there anything built in, whether it's at Host or CPD, to help us really kind of look at the big picture of what is happening in our city as we're allowing more and more and we've been doing these as one offs , but, you know, we started doing them in different neighborhoods where we're doing them neighborhood wide. And I'm just curious, Andrew, if, you know, whether that's been part of any bigger city conversation. Sure. Absolutely. I'm glad you asked that. And I may ask my colleague Abe to add to the discussion here, but especially as these these neighborhood wide legislative rezonings have come up, I know that that has been a question that has come up more frequently. And and we've had opportunities to look at some of the existing models out there for building and standardizing use as an affordable housing tool. And I would just highlight that we actually have a project going on right now. The Adams in Denver project that may be aware of that is actually looking at the the regulations and other trends relating to use and may be a good venue to explore issues around affordability. Yeah, I think the biggest issue is access to capital. So if somebody doesn't have equity in their existing structure to be able to borrow to build another unit on their site, unless you are in an area where property values have appreciated more or you have the equity, you know, I mean, again, that's all about the equity in your property. But unless you have the capital to do that, certain folks in certain neighborhoods that may have been zoned will not have the same opportunities. So are we doing anything as a city to create opportunities for access to capital to assist this, especially for lower income home owners who would want to take advantage of some wealth building opportunities? Sure. Thank you, Councilwoman. There's a barge with community planning and development. I'll just jump in to help answer since I'm on the ADOS in Denver project team. The project that Andrew mentioned that will be having its first stakeholder committee meeting in about two months. So it's just getting started. Those are all really good points. You know, Blueprint Denver recommends it to use as a housing choice throughout the city under the assumption that it's going to expand opportunities for housing, bringing in new types of housing for neighborhoods that, you know, may only accommodate, you know, one type of lifestyle. But making it possible for there to be smaller and potentially more affordable market rate units in neighborhoods. But there's a lot of other questions that you bring up. There's the, you know, who really gets to take advantage of this question. And, yes, they're expensive to build. And so naturally, folks with more money are going to be more ready to actually build a to use. However, you know, we're certainly told that bank financing is changing and modernizing in a way that should increase access to capital for some folks that maybe are a little lower on the income range . But also there are programs like the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative, Single Family Plus program that's just operating in West Denver now. But that's a program that received some city support and they're looking to expand and we're in conversations with them. And it's a program that basically helps homeowners build accessory dwelling units. Generally speaking, the homeowner has to be income qualified or it has to be a homeowner that will agree to deed restrict the actual accessory dwelling on the income qualified. Residents. And so there really are a lot of things that we can talk about as part of the ideas in Denver program to increase access for people to actually live in accessory dwelling units, but also for existing homeowners to be able to take advantage of the wealth building opportunities that they have in their property. So the issue of whether or not we're seeing the impact to affordability, can you address that piece of it? So I guess what would your question broadly be? Is it making neighborhoods more affordable to have more less filling units available or. Less affordable. Or less affordable? Yeah. Yeah. That's a very hard monitoring. That is my question at all. We are we are trying to figure out if we can. And we just had a conversations with. Member of the Department of Finance. And access to the permits that they obtain. And then, you know, you would think by by seeing the address, somehow, we should be able to identify some of that data. But yeah, we can see, for example, what a property's assessed value was from the assessor before they added an ADU. And then we can look at, you know, up to two years later when the property was reassessed, how the value might have changed. Oftentimes even that is a little complicated because they many times would make a lot of other improvements to the property right at the same time. And as we know, property values in general have been going up a lot. So it's hard to figure out where some of these increases in value. Yeah, in some cases they'll go through the process, but not yet build them right away either. Now that we're pretty clear on from talking to the assessor and to real estate experts that we're not seeing property value increases just from rezoning to actually taking the action of improving the property with an idea, of course, does affect the property value. All right. So who is tracking that? The accessory dwelling units in Denver, project team and CPD, of which I'm part. Okay. Thank you. Very. Much for joining. Us. I did. Thank you, Madam President. Councilman Ortega, I just wanted to answer a couple of the questions that you had. Since Councilman Herndon and I are sponsoring this legislative rezoning. We did a number of conversations and calls with with West Denver Renaissance Collaborative, with organizations that are working to create affordable ADA use in places like San Francisco , Austin, L.A., several other places, so and Portland. So we did go through that, those conversations and also had that conversation with the community. We have already seen from assessor data that the value of land in East Colfax is going up, which is an indication that gentrification is already happening. So if we are so the purpose behind doing this is to help stop that gentrification in in one of many different ways. That is a tool in the toolbox to help support residents who already own properties in East Colfax to create wealth. We have talked to the West Denver Renaissance Collaborative and some other partners about, you know, potentially moving over to the east side to help support this rezoning. So there's a lot of conversation going on in the background. There's a section in the staff report that you can read about the conversations that we had during our research into this as we began this process in early 2021. So just wanted to to fill in what staff was saying with some of the things that we had done as well. And happy to talk more with you about that offline. If you're if you're interested in me going on and on and on about it. I think that's that's helpful to know that that was part of this process as well. All right. Great. Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer and Ortega. Next up, we've got Councilmember Flynn. Thank you, Madam President. Andrew Robb. I don't know who can best address this or perhaps council members from those two districts can address it. But I'm taken in the staff report by the very small number of letters directly to us or in support or opposition, just a handful from such an enormous area that's being risen. I did see a list of comments supportive and in opposition, and there were quite a number of them that apparently came from a survey or a meeting or maybe you can explain that. But no R.A. letters, no registered neighborhood organization letters. I've heard a lot about the outreach that was done, but why are we not having the feedback? Do you have an explanation for that? Thank you for that. And I'll I'll ask the sponsors to perhaps add to that as well. But I certainly I should have also noted that there were extensive responses received on those on those surveys. And so and, you know, I can only speculate, but it may be that, you know, some residents or neighbors thought, oh, I've already weighed in on this. And so we didn't receive further input directed toward us, our staff. But but yeah. So they did get hundreds of participants in and surveying. Part of our interruption. Can you were these online surveys or were they collected at meetings or combination of that? Do you want me to take that? Yes, if you would, Councilman. Yeah, absolutely. So, Councilman Herndon and I prepared a survey that actually Councilwoman Sandoval provided to us from her TV park rezoning, and we changed it and added to some of those questions based on the specific need to East Colfax. We sent oh, gosh, we sent at least two mailers to every household. We knocked every household and delivered information to them about it. We had two online meetings where the assessor's office was there. The exercise license was there to talk about the issue of short term rentals. Tina Axlerod was there to discuss some of the specifics around the footprint of ADA use. And, you know, there are a couple of places where there aren't alleys. So looking at those kinds of specifics, we had a gosh, I mean, I think we had something like 8% or a Renee Martinez Stone was a presenter as well and the partnership was also present are so there's only one neighborhood organization in the east Colfax and then two sort of business support groups. The East Colfax Neighborhood Association chose not to take a position at all. One of the business groups chose not to take a position. The other business group sent a letter of support. So and also just to clarify what you're looking at in there, we so it was an online survey, but we we worked with the neighborhood organizations and the business groups to get out into the community, to get them to get people to fill out those surveys. Well, over 70% of the people who filled out the survey were in support of of this rezoning. And additionally, when you are doing a SurveyMonkey survey, you can, on the back end do some things to make sure that the data is accurate and people aren't responding over and over and over again and things like that. So we moved everyone who responded, who was not a resident in the East Colfax neighborhood or did not identify as a resident in these Colfax neighborhood out of the survey and then looked at the survey results. So what you are seeing in the staff report is all of the comments that were positive and all of the comments that were negative and then the results of the report of the survey by people who are living in the East Colfax neighborhood. Thank you very much. That's very good to hear. Do Andrew or Abe, do you have a count based on what the councilwoman said as to how many unique individuals did provide input? During this process. I believe the information we got that was that they received 139 responses. And and of those, 106 said that they supported the proposed. Rezoning, and that was the filtered list that Councilwoman Sawyer mentioned. I believe it was just residents filtering out those who identified as outside the neighborhood or who did not identify as within the neighborhood, I believe. FLYNN That's correct. Okay. Thank you very much, Madam President. That's all I have. All right. Great. Thank you. Up next, we've got Councilman Cashman. Yeah, thank you, Madam President. Either one of you gentlemen can answer this. I would hope, and I don't think you're doing it yet, that the addresses of 80 youths that are approved and resound to the one X or whatever it happens to be would be cross-referenced with our list of short term rental licenses. And when the rental registry program goes into full speed and I don't remember, Madam President, when that said to go the rental registry program. We are it's going to kick off the beginning of 2022 for early registration. Great. Well, and the same thing for that list. So we can really understand what what these properties are being used for. I'm generally a strong supporter of ADA use, but I do as I believe Councilwoman Ortega put forward, have a have a question. I don't want to see them used only for a use or in large numbers. I think it would defeat the promises that were this important program is being put forth for. And I'm just amazed at the amount of outreach that Councilmember Sawyer and Herndon put forth on this, whereas with Councilman Flynn, one speaker, you know, at the public hearing and no real strong comments from neighborhood groups. Thank you. That's all. Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. We've got Councilmember Hines. You're up next. Thank you. Council president, thank you for your work. Councilmember Ortega asked about housing affordability. Areas can be used for short term rentals, but only when the home or 80 was occupant or occupied. As I write, the owner must live on site. That's correct. And what about an 80 you and a home? One of which is a 365 short term rental and the other is a short term rental for just shy of half a year. I was an article in Denver write about a woman is traveling in South America and she is you know, she lives in her home just over half a year. Can is that allowed? I know I'm kind of asking you a question that well, it's certainly relevant to this conversation because we've got 2000 potential ideas. Yeah, and that's a great question. Councilman Hines and I may ask Abe to add to this as well, but you can only have one firm license or a short term rental license per property. So there may be some challenges, you know, renting out both the primary dwelling unit and the and the accessory dwelling unit, even if somebody doesn't live in the primary dwelling unit all year round. I, I don't believe it would be possible to have two separate short term rentals on one property. But that. Sure. Thank you. Councilman Hines. A barge with CBD again. So Andrew is correct that the pertinent regulations are that you could hold only one license for the property. The rules state that you can have only one short term rental contract at any given time, meaning that you couldn't rent to multiple parties on the same night under the same license. However, I don't remember all the details. I did read the article and was very jealous of the woman living in Peru. But she could, if she, for example, had a detached accessory dwelling unit and lived there as her primary residence. She had her voter registration there or other things, and she was there about half the year she could, while she was gone, rent out either the accessory dwelling unit or the primary house to a party of people on as a short term rental, but not both at the same time. Well, I think that's a good question and something that may require a little more clarification moving forward. My read of the regulations would say she could rent the whole property to two one group of people, including both the primary dwelling unit and the ADU. But it would be like one family, not, you know, one group of students in the ADU and a family in the primary or something like that. Okay. Well. This woman chose to put herself in the press. So I'm sure I'm sure we'll look into it. I want to ask one more thing. So to Councilmember, I take his point about affordability. We have seniors, right. Who have lived in their homes for 40 years, 50 years, and and the value of their home has gone way up. But they don't realize that value until it's sold. And so what they do realize is that their property taxes are way more than they were when they bought the home. And so as you're considering this analysis, I would also encourage I don't know how exactly to do it, but I'm giving you the problem. You figured out the solution. How many units are now made affordable where the owner could not afford the property taxes or the on going living in that in their dwelling, if not for the extra income that a native provides. Hmm. All right. Thank you. Thank you, Casper. All right. Thank you, Councilmember Haines. Councilmember Sawyer. Thanks, Madam President. Just wanted to quickly respond to Councilmember Hines this question about the short term rentals. So Councilman Flynn and I sit on the short term rental advisory committee, and that is one of the things that we are discussing in one of the upcoming quarterly meetings. So I invite you to attend. But the issue of short term rentals and their effect on affordability to rent long term in the city is one of the things that we are looking at. So just wanted to let you know that that's one of the things that short term rental advisory committee is is undertaking next year. Thanks. All right. Thank you, Councilmember Steuer and thank you, Abe and Andrew for answering those questions. The public hearing is closed comments by members of Council on Council Bill 1321, and we'll go to Councilmember Sawyer first and then Councilmember Herndon and follow up with any other members in the queue. Thanks, Madam President. I got to put my reading glasses on here. First, I want to really say thank you so much to CPD staff. You guys were amazing over the course of this, I guess a year and almost a half since we started talking about this. So truly grateful for all of your guidance and support and assistance and all of those different things. And looking forward to seeing what comes from the EDU working group in the next couple of years. And also a huge thank you to Councilwoman Sandoval and to Naomi, because you just truly gave us all of the help of background in the world and support to allow us to be able to do this. So thank you so much for that. Councilman Herndon, also, I really want to say thank you. You are you've been a fantastic partner and I very much appreciate on that. I very much appreciate that. So I'm not going to rehash everything. We've kind of talked about it, but I do just want to quickly touch base on the broader picture. So Blueprint, as we heard, called for us to implement zoning tools to incentivize the preservation of smaller and more affordable housing units. With the median home price in Denver nearing $600,000 and an average rent of nearly 1900 dollars a month. Blueprint's plan to incentivize affordable housing options has become more than a mandate. It's more than optional at this point. It's something we have to do as legislators in any way we can to help preserve affordability in our city. Rezoning these almost for, I guess, a little over 475 acres allows homeowners to construct, to use. And it's a small and crucial step in helping the greater city of Denver and keeping it a great place to live. So I hope the rest of my colleagues will support it. And thank you so much. Thank you, Councilmember Sawyer. Councilmember Herndon. Thank you, Madam President. And this is an exciting time. It's funny, I remember these first conversations and now we are here before this. And so I'm just thankful for everyone. And the one person that was not thanked, it was Councilwoman Sawyer for your partnership on this and for your work, the East Colfax community. And I think this is a testament to the outreach that we've done. Everyone was well aware of this and multiple opportunities to weigh in. And now we're here in front of council and we had one speaker who actually doesn't live in East Colfax, but we appreciate Jesse Parrish giving his comments anyway. And so this is a great opportunity to do multiple things, whether you want to read out the ADA or move into the ADA because you want to downsize because the house that you have is too large. And so I'm excited about this neighborhood to have this opportunity. I hope that other council members will consider this as well. And again, Councilwoman Sandoval, thank you so much for your efforts in letting us know how to work this, because, as we say, plagiarism can be a form of flattery because we try to do almost everything that she did. And lastly, I just want to thank Leah Hartman from my District eight office, because she was the point person in doing this, working with Council District five, working with CPD. And I really wanted you to publicly. Thank her for all of her work, and I hope my colleagues support this. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you. Councilmember Herndon. Councilmember Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. Just want to acknowledge the two council. It's not an easy task to get this kind of outreach done, especially during the time of COVID. And for the record, in Chaffee Park, we were here almost over a year ago, rezoning 1700 birds and Chaffey Park, and not one ADA permit has been pulled. People are working on them. But it doesn't mean that just because you have the entitlement, meaning you have the ability to build something, that you necessarily build it. And one of the things that I hope that comes forward when the ADA you project task force comes is that the cost of the accessory dwelling units do go down in Loveland. They just rezoning the entire city of Loveland of 78,000 people, which probably makes them more council districts. But what they did is they have everything being accessory. So you don't have to get a separate sewer tap. You tap into your main tap because it's an accessory dwelling unit to the main dwelling unit. And so when Naomi from my staff and I met with Loveland, they gave us a lot of great ideas on how to make more of the accessory dwelling units affordable moving forward in Denver. Because the need for this type of gentle density in a city that has changed the landscape and the built environment has changed is so necessary. So I just wanted to offer my support and say thank you. Well, then. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And I'll go ahead and chime in. We don't have anybody else in the queue. I'm really happy to support this. And I want to sincerely thank councilmembers Sawyer and Herndon for your proactive front end work. I think it is a testament to the engagement and questions answered of community, something this significant. We did have one speaker and the questions were pretty routine and so really appreciate all of the work that you put in to this and happy to support it this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 13 1321, please. CdeBaca. Sawyer. I. Herndon. I. I. Katherine. I. I. Sandoval. I. Torres. Right. Black. I. Clark. My friend. I. Madam President, i. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results. 12 Hours 12 IES Council Bill 21 Dash 1321 has passed.

- Councilmember Ranga motioned to adopt the resolution to execute this contract, which was seconded by Councilmember Austin.

- There was no public comment on this agenda item.

Rehabilitation appears one, two and three at Alameda Point. Do you. And then we have. So member de sog understand you pulled up pulled this. I pulled it. I remember already. Did you want to start then. I just wanted to hear the presentation and then I'll make a brief comment after the presentation. I'm. Good evening. Good evening, mayor and City Council members. I'm Nanette Mchunu and the Community Development Department. Also in Bay three is. So this study, let me tell you a little bit about peers one, two and three. In 2008, the city that our governing body initiated a study, a condition assessment report of peers one, two and three at Alameda Point. And at that time, the peer well, let me just say the peers were constructed in the 1940s. Peer one peers two and three are large, reinforced concrete structures originally designed for aircraft carriers. Pier One is a smaller steel and concrete cellular structure. And at that time, the majority of Pier One was in general good condition. It was built in 19, rebuilt in 1980. Pier two, which is what I call the workhorse of our piers, because it's used on both sides for most for the myriad ships. And it is heavily used. And this kind of. Can you show us with your pointer location? Sure. Let's see if this pointer works. We would dim the lights, but then a councilmember couldn't see. Yeah. Oh. So I think this is a clicker, not a pointer. There's. All right. I might need some technical assistance from the city clerk. Yes. This one? Yeah, I. We're not working now. Oh, sorry. We need to turn it on that now. How many city employees? Okay. All right, so I'm here, it appears. This is Pier One, the shorter one. This is Pier two with all the ships on it. So it's the workhorse. And this is pure three where Hornet also is located. Just for your reference. Thank you. You're welcome. So Pier three is actually in the best condition of all the piers. And it's sort of unfortunate because it's there and it doesn't necessarily take advantage of all of the services there. It could be since it's just a museum and it's not a working vessel. It it could you know, it's unfortunate that the ships these other ships are not being able to take advantage of it. So I'm the 2008 study gave us this assessment that the peers were in fair to poor or fairly good condition, depending on which peer we were talking about. And during that whole time we had been since then, we'd been really wanting to go deeper and figure out what we need to do to breathe new life in these pillars. We have a tenant and I'm here, the mirrored chips, which has about 15 more years left on these piers. And they are not doing so well because remember, this study said they were in good to fair condition in 2008, which was eight years ago. So the study that we're proposing to do tonight or we're asking your permission to find tonight is a let me back up a little bit that the 2008 report was a study that asked for more studies. And I'm I'm quite frankly, I'm kind of over those kinds of studies. And we really need a study that tells us what we need to do next. And as a city, we can't afford to wait to have 10,000 more studies to do. So the study that we're proposing tonight is the first in three phases. And so the first phase is to get in, get under the water, look at the piles, do some sampling. Tell us what the heck is going on down there, because we know that the piles underneath the piers are are damaged and there's some organic materials that are destroying them, which is not unusual for peat piles that age. And also, we want to know the next step. What do we do to repair them short of tearing them all out and rebuilding, which we don't have the money to do? What can we do to breathe new life into these piers for the next 15 years for myriad or longer? So the report that. But a group that we selected as BGH has a. Yes. Thank you. The city clerk is going to show you some pictures of our lovely piers from underneath the wharf. And Miss McNaught, she's pulling us up. Could you just remind us what Murat is and the importance of. Sure. Sure. The mirrored ships are the ready reserve fleet. They are in the Department of Transportation. They are not Navy ships. They are ships that were decommissioned and they inherited from the Navy. And they are deployed when there are natural disasters or a need for our country to respond. They were in Haiti during the earthquake. If there were if there were a huge earthquake and when there will be a huge earthquake in this region, the mirrored ships will play an important role. I attended a meeting with FEMA representatives talking about what's going to happen in the region. And the myriad ships were were. Key. To what's what will happen. And the fact that those ships are in Alameda really guarantees that goods and services will come to Alameda. So they're very critical to our city. Also locally, they ships alone represent roughly 6%, I think is the number of 6% of the energy consumed of all of Alameda, those ships alone. And also and I think and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you may know this, I think when California was having a lot of rolling blackouts, the ships were able to convert to their own power source to save the draw within our city. So they were able to they're able to be a large consumer that helps our city. And they also are able to support themselves, which also helps the city. Exactly. That's the punch line is they're a major revenue source for our Alameda Municipal. They're one of our largest tenants. Allow me to point the other important thing, which is kind of an intangible, is that they support a lot of the maritime industry in the Bay Area. A lot of the small welders or people who can can make things that you can't make find for these ships anymore are employed by Myriad to help keep those ships running. So they they are a feeder of other other businesses. Thank you. And could they also be used if there were a time when we needed to evacuate a large number of citizens? I would imagine that that would be a significant that would be a role they could play. I don't know if they would play it because they really are about staging. They're able to put together a hospital in a matter of two days. And so I think that if we were needing to deploy people, I think between them and the wider facility, that would be a way of getting people on and off that island. Thank you. I think the pictures are up. Okay. So I think we're just going to go. I mean, I don't there's nothing to really tell. It's just a visual about the pork. Maybe tell us what we're looking at. Okay. So these are some of the piles that are underneath there, underneath our our piers. You can see the concrete is not in the best condition and you can keep going. And then some of them, you can see that the corrosive material on the outside, you'll see below the water. A lot of them are just eaten away. And so they're not even connected to the ground anymore because of the the corrosive material. This is the concrete on the work. This is the material that kind of gets on there and the concrete on the wharf and the vaults they're cracking. And, you know, I think I remember council member matter. I see if I see your mattress, you won't say anything over the water just gets beaten. And and that's kind of what we're seeing here is that this concrete is completely compromised. You see a diver down there looking at like the this the deterioration of the concrete on the piles. Am so sorry stage is proposing to work 250 days on I on I study the first 100 there were going to be in the water testing getting samples you see the little have a corrosion has below the water really compromise the the piles. We'll be testing. And then they take the the test results and they compile an engineering analysis. And remember, we're not going to have a report that asks for other reports. And from that analysis, they are going to identify the deficiencies in our facility. At the end of the day, the city is going to get a product with recommendations for repair, a variety of repair schemes. So they're not going to just force us into one kind of solution. They're going to say, if you want five more years, this is what we do. If you if you need 20 more years out of this, this is what you should do. And so we can work together. It will be a process of developing a plan for those, Piers. And in addition, there will be cost estimates. We will have they will provide us with what they think it'll cost to do some of these repairs. Of course, we will bid it out and see what the market says, but we'll have some idea of what we're getting into. And we'd have to we'll have to find the money. But most importantly, as we put together this plan, they're going we're going to put together a priority list of what we really need to take care of and and move move forward to try to, number one, keep the mirrored ships here and support them and to provide them with a facility that meets their needs through the life of their contract and even beyond. If if we can negotiate that. Or and also to breathe new life into our peers that have not really had a lot of TLC since the eighties. So that's the that's the goal of this. You have any questions? Just one question. Can you kind of describe because I'm not sure if everyone understands how the sewage is processed on a pier currently. So Pier two had a major sewer line break. And the problem, as you can see, this picture kind of tells you the problem with a lot of the infrastructure on the piers is it's under the piers. And so there are not a lot of contractors who want to work under the piers. And so either we end up getting gouged because we can only find one person who can do the work or we have to piece it together and figure out what we're going to do long term. And so we actually bid this right now, the the the ships are they're equipped to be on sea. So they their sewage is in their tanks. And we are paying to have those tanks pumped out and the waste trucked out. I'm happy to report that the council approved a sewer replacement project which will bring the sewer sewer line above the pier, but it costs $1.4 million and the project will be completed next month. So we'll stop doing that. But that's the that's what's going on here, too, right now. Then just quick comments. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I pulled this because, I mean, to me, this is kind of like my little pet issue is everyone. When they take me around town, they want to show me their deteriorating Piers. So I I'm all in favor of this. I'm not going to vote against that. I didn't pull it for that. But I think it's important for people to see these pictures because they don't get an opportunity to see them like we do either in like a consent calendar or when we're going on tour. So if you go around town, it's not only Pier two, you go to Alameda Marina. You know, some of the wooden ones are like stalactites and stalagmites where, you know, they're not even touching each other anymore. They're so rotted out. The Grand Marina, you know, the owners there showed me their peers and wharfs are deteriorating. Alameda landing. So it's just to kind of draw attention to this issue and keep it on our radar that, you know, this is kind of a priority of mine to make sure we find a way to replace this crumbling infrastructure. So I appreciate your presentation and the pictures. Thank you. And that being said, could you explain the funding source? I'm sure this this project is being funded out of the Tidelands Fund. So it is these these piers are on the Tidelands. And so all the revenue that's collected from the Tidelands property has to be reinvested in Tidelands property. So this is a perfect use for those funds. Thank you very much. Any other questions or comments? Council members? We have a motion. You pull that, you make it. I'll move approval of the item. I'll second all those in favor. A motion carried unanimously. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now we move to six a. Adoption of resolution appointing a member of the Civil Service Board. And Ron Taylor is a member of the Gulf Commission. I know what you mean. I move that we approve the appointment as listed. Second. All those in favor. I motion carried unanimously. Thank you. And I want to thank Troy Ozma and Ron Taylor for stepping up. I congratulate them.","Recommendation to Award a Contract in the Amount of $456,800, and Authorize the City Manager to Approve Contract Changes, if Necessary, Up to a Ten Percent Contingency in the Amount of $45,680, for a Total Amount of $502,480, to Simpson Gumpertz & Heger, Inc. for the Interim Inspection, Testing, Preliminary Analyses and Reporting Services for Rehabilitation of Piers 1, 2 and 3 at Alameda Point. (Base Reuse 819099)","Here is a concise summary of the main points, proposed initiatives, and rationale from the presentation:

- Initiative to conduct a phased engineering study and analysis on Piers 1, 2 and 3 at Alameda Point to assess their structural condition and needed repairs.

- The piers, constructed in the 1940s, are deteriorating and in fair to poor condition based on a 2008 assessment. Critical repairs are needed to extend their usable lifespan.

- Pier 2 is heavily utilized by the Ready Reserve Fleet (Maritime Administration ships) which is a major tenant generating significant revenue for the city's tidelands fund. Ensuring the piers' integrity is vital for retaining this key maritime operation.

- Phase 1 study ($456,800 contract plus 10% contingency) will inspect underwater piles, do sampling/testing, and provide a comprehensive engineering analysis with repair recommendations and cost estimates. 

- Goals are to repair/rehabilitate the piers as needed rather than full reconstruction, preserve maritime industrial use, support disaster relief capabilities of the Ready Reserve Fleet, and breathe new life into this critical infrastructure.

- Funding source is the city's tidelands fund which must be reinvested into tidelands properties per regulations.

The rationale emphasizes preserving a major maritime operation and revenue source for the city while responsibly maintaining and extending the lifespan of aging critical infrastructure assets on public tidelands.",0.78,"Approach each presentation by thoroughly understanding the logical flow, context, and objectives first through unstructured reasoning.

We started this process in May of last this past year with a public notice announcing the process and the requirements for naming the recreation center. In response to that, the committee, a committee was formed and the result was a petition with more than a thousand names. More than 130 letters or emails of support, which included letters from Councilman Albus Brooks, Councilman Paul Lopez. Former Councilwoman Elvira Wedgeworth. Former Councilmember Jeannie Robb. State Representative Beth McCann. State Representative Angela Williams. Former Councilwoman Marsha Johnson. Former Councilwoman Peggy Lehman. Former Councilman Rick Garcia. Brad Buchanan, the Executive Director of Community Planning and Development. Joel Noble, President of Curtis Park Neighbors. And the list goes on. So the committee submitted the petitions and the letters in support. We determined that the recommendation from this committee met all of the requirements of our naming policy. And so we brought that ordinance to the request for the ordinance to City Council Committee earlier this month. It did go to the Parks and Rec Advisory Board in November, as is required by our process. The Parks and Rec Advisory Board unanimously voted to move forward the recommendation of the naming of the Central Denver Recreation Center to be named in honor of Kahlo Madison. And so I'm here with the. A voluminous record in case you should want to investigate any of those. But I'm here on behalf of. To urge your consideration, your favorable consideration of this item this evening. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Haines. And I want to welcome our. Our honorable former council president as well. We have eight speakers signed up today and I'm going to call the first five and ask you make your way to the front pew that test the bad techs David Roybal, David Wahlstrom, Joel Noble and Marney Ward. You five, please make your way up to the front pew. And, Mr. Texa8, you may begin your remarks. Thank you. Thad, Texas 4535, Julian Street, Denver, Colorado. Retreats and vigils are statements of good intentions. But I wonder what Carla madison would say about you giving a $10 million bribe to Adams County, another $20,000 to pay a claim against the police and building a recreation center for middle class people. While, as we heard tonight, 120 people are freezing along our rivers and under our bridges. Of course, only $20,000 in claims against the police makes this a relatively good night for Denver taxpayers. Thank you, Mr. Text. David Roybal. Hello. My name is David Roy. I want to wish you all a happy holiday. And I'm in support of this bill. You know, we can label a building historic, but, you know, it's a labor. We're after a councilmember that's done a lot of work and we just thankful for all the work that she did for our community to name that and evaluate, you know, the the work that that person did and the community coming together on behalf of that, that's something that we could be proud of as Democrats. Thank you. Thank you, David Wahlstrom. Thank you. A little longer, but I think I can do this 3 minutes. My name's Dave Wahlstrom, 1265 Cherry Street, a couple of blocks away from the in-progress Under-Construction Central Denver Recreation Center. Thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf in favor for the call of Madison Recreation Center Naming Ordinance. And Meyers is executive director of the Kovacs Business Improvement District, Colfax on the Hill. It was my privilege and honor and joy really to work with Carla on the revitalization of East Colfax, including the community outreach and the support of the new rec center both before and during Carlos City Council years. Why so many of Carla's friends and colleagues wanted to be a part of this citizens naming initiative as very easy to explain, to know Carla was to love Carla. For the person she was and for all that she did for our community and city. It was this experience of Karla that energized the citizens. Name a petition with its 1067 signatures, 128 letters of support from both the public and the private partnership sectors, including 12 registered neighborhoods and business organizations in the immediate area of the new rec center location at Colfax and Josephine. In our petition, we believe we have met Denver Parks and Recreation's official criteria for naming the recreation center. I ought to have Madam Secretary Speed read this criteria, but I'm going to do this as best I can. Here is what we had to meet. Quote well, the name be have historical and cultural and social significance for generations to come. Well, the name and gender are a strong and positive image. Well, if memorialize or commemorate people's places or event that are of the enduring importance to the community, well, then gender significant ties of friendship and mutual recognition and support within the community . Will a name be identified with some major achievement or advancement of the public good within the community? Well, the name be particularly suitable for the recreational facility based on its location and the surrounding neighborhood. Lastly, will the name have symbolic value that transcends ordinary meaning or use and enhance the character and identity of the recreational facility? About this last criterion in her endorsement letter, former city councilwoman Jenny Raab said it best. I think, as I quote from her letter, not unlike the other successful city projects, many people are deserving of credit for the rec center's reality, including this council. But the naming should be about the spirit of the place. Karla's openness, inclusiveness, funkiness, yes, and creativity all speak to the sort of place we want the center to be. In closing, and to underscore in your statement, I believe Carla Madison's life purpose in life centers purpose are one and the same. That being the mutual dedication to the visitors, it's all to nobody here. 3 minutes that both in the individual and in the collective. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you. That's. Joel. Joel Noble. Council President Herndon, Members of City Council. My name is Joel Noble. I live at 2705 Stout Street, and I'm here as president of Curtis Park Neighbors, an active neighborhood organization in what was Council District eight, Carla Madison's district. Carl Madison was a strong advocate for the health and well-being of neighborhoods. And I'm just going to give you a couple anecdotes of what you did for our neighborhood. Similar stories can be told throughout what was District eight in Rennick running for office. She visited with us many times and asked, What are our challenges and what are our goals? And we gave her our 1988, her 1989 neighborhood plan and said, there's a lot in here that we put together that is not making progress. Can you help with us? And those became her priorities for the neighborhood. More was achieved in her leadership than we'd ever dared to hope. She brought zoning in line with the actual character of our neighborhood, serving on the Zoning Code Task Force. She instigated a plan for the 30th in Blake Station area, which is now starting to develop. She supported adding bike lanes to our major arterials through the neighborhood and doing projects such as road diets and one way to two way conversions that have calmed the traffic in our neighborhood. Supporting safety for all. She supported the creation of the Five Points Business District, which, with already support in the state, support has catalyzed the transformation of Welton Street now in progress. In promoting a new vision for Arapaho Square. She brought the whole community together to picture what could happen with that area of parking lots, including a vision for a new park. She supported the completion of our landmark districts with four new landmark districts and Curtis Park completing the protection of our historic area. And then having achieved so much that was called for our night in our 1989 plan. The last gift she gave to our neighborhood was the creation of the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan, our new neighborhood plan that charts the course for the next 20 years. Carla has left an indelible impression on our neighborhood and on all District eight neighborhoods, commemorating her leadership as a strong, positive leader. By naming the rec center in her honor as the rec center that she helped make possible is very appropriate. By unanimous vote of the Curtis Park Board of Directors, please. Name of Carla. Thank you, Marnie Ward. And right before Ms.. Ward begins her remarks, I want to call the last three speakers up Darrell Watson, Jackie Shumway and Paul Weiss. So you can make your way up this way. You may begin your remarks. Thank you. I am Ernie Ward. I live at 2341 Lafayette Street in Denver. I am a singer and a performing artist and a proud 15 year resident of the Whittier neighborhood. Kahlo, Madison and I shared a mutual love of all things funky. That is F.U and K-Y. Maybe one of our favorite was shoes. At some point we realized that we were the same size shoes. And about five years ago, Carly gave me the shoes that I wear tonight. I love them. They're orange. What's a better color than orange? They have straps that wrap up my ankles. You can look at them later. It's okay. I know you want to. They can all see them. I don't presume to know what it's like to walk a mile in her shoes, but I know she's not only walked the walk, talked the talk, but took action and made things happen in our community for all people. Carla was and still is my friend, but she was also one of my biggest fans. Every show she was front and center, and it wasn't just for my show, but the countless theaters and art galleries, big and small, on the sidewalks with the buskers and the chalk artists and in our alleys admiring graffiti art. Carla loved it all because Carla was art. This quality is one of the things that I admired most about her as an artist. We sometimes feel like we are pushed aside and that our opinions don't matter or that we are not heard. We took Carla were some of the first people that she sought out when needing to make a new decision or having a new proposal in front of her. She loved Denver and actively worked to make it a better place for its residents and visitors. From the Uptown Sampler to City Park Festival of the Arts, the City Park Ice Cream Social. And this was before she represented us so beautifully on the City Council. People were drawn to Carla because of her spirit, her curiosity of the world, and her determination to make it a better place, not because of the recognition, but for the greater good of all people. What a better way to honor the spirit of the West that Carla exemplified daily than by naming a building in her honor. And not just a building, but a gathering place, a gathering place where people will actively be making their minds, bodies and spirits stronger, engaging in community activities, seeking knowledge and skills to improve themselves and our communities, and of course, to share the love that Carla had for our four legged fur babies, that they have a gathering place as well. There are many people in our community who are worthy of having their name on this building, but I feel that it's very appropriate it be Carla madison, who lived in the spirit and service of others. Thank you. Thank you, Darryl. Darryl Watson. Good evening, President Herndon, members of Council. My name is Darryl Watson and I'm president of the Whittier Neighborhood Association. And I'd like to start off by saying the Whittier Neighborhood Association Board voted unanimously in support of naming the rec center after Carla madison. I'm so happy that Joel and Dave went ahead of me. So you guys had all the facts. I'm going to tell a story. I met Carla Madison a long, long time ago in a galaxy far away in the late nineties. Some of you remember the nineties at the turn of the century when she was president of City Park West Neighborhood Association. I started my first tour of duty as president of a Whittier Neighborhood Association, and it just pulled me back to become president again. But we serve closely with each other, working on zoning issues for City Park West and for the Whittier neighborhood. I read something recently that Councilman Charlie Brown said about column Madison. He said even folks that disagreed with her couldn't stay mad at her for long. She was so damn likable. And I hope Dan isn't cursing, but I apologize. But she was so likable. I agree with that story. I agree with that sentiment. She was truly life in love with in our district. I told this story at the Parks and Rec Advisory Board meeting. I'll say it again. When Colin, I ran for City Council in 2007, my mother's first response to my mom actually lived with me at that time. My mother's first response wasn't, Oh, son, I'm so happy you're running. I can't wait to support you. Her first response was, Why are you running against the orange haired lady that could say something about my relation to my mom? But it doesn't. It says a lot about kind of Madison and the love that people have for her. My mom didn't know her. She just knew that she was that wonderful lady with orange hair that took care of the neighborhood, including the Whittier neighborhood. It is fitting that. They call it Madison Recreation Center is on Colfax. Colfax. It's tough and so is she. It shines brightly and so does her memory. And thank God no amount of redevelopment can subdue its quirkiness. Need I say more? Carla was as quirky and as wonderful a city council member and a friend that you can ever have. Who else could we name this recreation center after? I thank you. Each member of the City Council for voting unanimously tonight, and I'm assuming that you will vote unanimously tonight to rename the recreation center after our councilwoman, Carla madison. Thank you very much. Thank you. Jackie. Jackie Shumway. Okay. I'm going to oftentimes I'll start off what I'm doing, singing you a little bit. And I was coming up tonight thinking about what do I do for Carla? Because Carla was the one who actually got me and convinced me that running for school board was possible and I could still be odd and crazy and everything else because that's what she did. And at the same time, she was very bright and she knew what she was very serious about, making the city better. And so I can remember the two of us in a laughing about when she endorsed me for the first time. And she says to me, you know, I said, What song should we sing together? And she, you know, of course, Carla wasn't a big singer, but she would tell me, she says, Oh, Jackie started laughing. The one that came to mind was, All I wanna do is have some fun. I got a feeling I'm not the only one, which is kind of how I felt about her. And but I think it was experiential about Carla was that she this center could not be named for anybody but her because it really is an indication of what our our city is becoming. She was a huge part of changing the city into a place of vibrancy when we were kind of stuck in a place. Remember, we had the shoot, we had the convention coming here and we were all so excited. And at the same time, many of us knew that she had gone through cancer and we knew that there was a possibility we'd lose her. And I remember riding through the park one day, City Park, which I jokingly call Carla's run into where she was on her bike. I was on my we didn't actually run into each other. We did miss each other. But having this conversation occurred at seven in the morning about what we could do to get better input from people from her district. I wasn't even in her district. We were friends and I had helped her campaign because I thought she was so important. And as somebody said, you know, you're all adjacent to each other's districts. And it was important because she always looked at as the bigger city. When Jeannie Robb came to me one evening at a meeting that we hadn't seen each other in ages, and she came up to analysis there. I'm sorry, Councilman. Councilman Brooks is there, too. And they said to me something about naming the center after Carla madison. And I was like, Wow, how cool is that? I said, I think it's a great idea. And then I come back and I talked to Paul the next day and he says to me, If are they behind? I said, Yeah. I said, I didn't say anything. They came up to me, but that's how people felt about her. I was kind of just like everybody went, Oh yeah, like who would not do this? So I will tell you that some of the curmudgeons that we engage on, some of the neighborhood stuff were saying something today and I took them on today. And what I started, I just posted the thing about the Marx Brothers and Groucho Marx, 1932, horse feathers about, you know, no matter who commenced it, I'm against it. And so I sent it to them. And it was funny because I actually even got them to come around and talk about what they loved about her, what they thought was great, because it's hard not to notice that if we could all live our lives more like Carl Madison, I think our world will be a little better. And I will say that this outfit seriously bought this, and I turned to Paul tonight and said, Paul, I literally bought it. Not subconsciously, not even realizing it would be just like something she'd wear. So I had to wear it tonight and honor this. And this is what we would do is ride along with bicycles and do fun stuff. Wonderful lady. Please, please, please vote to name it after. Thanks. Jackie. Just needs you to introduce yourself for the record. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Jackie Shumway. As you do. It's just terrible. I never want people to know who I am. Jackie Shumway. Thank you. Glass. Glass Speaker Paul Weiss. Council. President. Members of council. It's very hard for me to continue saying anything after what you've heard tonight. If you had a chance to look. Through our letters of support. Through our petitions and our signatures. Even after that, we were two days late and we still got this many more signatures in this many more letters of support . The most difficult thing for me was learning where to start and where to end, because Carla had support from every corner of our district. When she barely got into the runoff, when she first ran with 28%, she organized and engineered an amazing comeback. When she passed, when she ran for reelection, she ran unopposed. And when she passed away, 37 people ran for her seat. That can only demonstrate the severe love and respect she had within her district among her peers. The article I read the article today was in the Denver Post. It was called The Vibrant Carla Madison. Every single one of her peers spoke of her in that article. And I'll tell you, it brought me to tears all afternoon. I wish I hadn't have read it, but everything everybody said tonight up to and including the orange juice. So I just don't know how to go on. I don't know what else to tell you. If you haven't understood that this is an appropriate name and they will leave a positive and lasting legacy by now. Then I don't know what else to say other than we are not here just for your vote. We are here for your an enthusiastic and unanimous vote. Thank you very much for considering naming the recreation center after Carla madison. Right. This. This concludes our speakers. Any questions? Do we have any questions from members of council? Questions. Nothing is coming up, so public hearing is now closed. Time for comments, Councilman Brooks. Thank you, Mr. President. This is this is beautiful. I think this is a beautiful display of. Of my community. For an incredible, incredible woman. So. Yeah. I'm going to share just a little bit. I have an interesting relationship with Carla because I was in the community, a community leader, and would work with Carla on a myriad of issues. And I was I put up this email today. I actually was emailing her about the most expensive dog park, which the this rec center is going to be built on. And just I could not believe we are spending an ungodly amount of bond money for this dog park. And and I was surprised how strong I was in the email, but she was so gentle and, and responding back to me and, and in such a gentle and loving way. And I think someone said it. I think it was Daryl. You know, you you may not have agreed she may have frustrated you on an issue because you're in leadership. You're going to frustrate Pete's people. But you never stayed upset at that woman because she embodied vibrance, she embodied life, and she was so inspiring. And so, you know, there's so much that she has done in this district. But I got the opportunity to sit in her office after she had passed away, after I was elected, and actually looked through notes that were not complete, look through projects that were not finished. And we as an office took it upon ourselves to finish some of those projects. And and it was it was an incredible opportunity. And by the way, Paul was there every step of the way saying, you know, she kind of would have liked it like this. And, you know, this is this is what she was thinking when she was putting this together, but some some great things that she was a part of. I think you heard a lot of great things, but I thought this was some other projects. Seek Livia down 23 and to park you council on her. How in the heck did we lose? That was one of the coolest events. And I remember Charlie Brown saying, Are you crazy? You want to shut down a street with cars and just have bikes? One of the best events that we've had in District eight, incredible. The ice cream social. Not a weirder event in the city and county of Denver. And the first time I went there, they made me a councilman. They made me dress up in this 1920, you know. Bow tie and everything. What a top hat. I was like, I cannot believe I'm doing this, but something happens. There's a little bit of magic that happens when you say, Hey, we're going to have people out here, you know, on big wheel bikes and actin silly and crazy and you connect with the community in a way. It's I wouldn't have thought of that first, but it worked. Obviously, her incredible strong leadership and blueprint Denver in 2010 basically led that process with with Jeanie Robb. Here's the one that's the hardest to do and replicate. She never missed the neighborhood meeting ever. And all the neighbors are mad at me because I don't go to every neighborhood meeting. And so we're still trying to get that one car. I don't know how you did it. She was incredible. But I actually do know how she did it. She had a wonderful help me in poor and poor, basically, because she was leading in the in the city. Paul was taking care of everything behind the scenes. And, you know, I'm excited to, you know, support this and and name this rec center, the Carla or the Madison. I don't know what you know, what it's going to come up with. We got to talk about it. But Paul, I feel like you're as much a part of this as she is. So there's a lot more we can say. This is going to be exciting that, you know, sometimes we rename buildings and the buildings are already built. And so you got to kind of put up a makeshift, you know, name and plate and it doesn't really look good, but we are this is this building is under construction as we speak. And so I hope that we can talk about happy hands, what the design looks like of the car because it can't just be a regular Carl Madison Rex. It has to be something funky on Colfax, the car or something like that. These are some orange shoes that I will never be able to feel, but I can only aspire to. And so I'm so excited to support the renaming of this rec center to the Carl of Madison Rec Center. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Lopez. Well. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you, Councilman Brooks, for your leadership and in helping organize and moving this forward. Carter Madison was my that's my colleague. I was elected in 2007. With Carla. And we both looked at each other very nervously. I was hurt myself, Councilman Neville, at the time. The three of us joined the council and there are council members who had been on council for for a while and had a whole bunch of experience. And here we were, a bunch of newbies, right? A young guy. And as freaky arts teacher. And that's what the are. I remember they did a profile on her and they said she reminds me, they, she reminds us less of a city council, more of our free yards. Teacher. Right. And and she was. She was absolutely unique. I've never met another human being like Carla. Working with her was a treasure. I'd have some kind of groundbreaking of some art piece by Gary Sweeney in Villa Park, and it was the first one. And in the West Side, you hear a lot of different engines and motors, and you kind of figure out, you know, which ones which. But you rarely hear that annoying little buzz of a scooter. And I did. And I remember turning around and I see this lady with this electric orange hair rolling up on her scooter and coming to a groundbreaking in my district just to be there, to be supportive. We had lunch together. We coalesced together. I remember the day that. We had the Infrastructure Priorities Task Force Committee. And those of you who have been part of this process for a long time know that there was no plan for rec center. In Central Denver at all. It wasn't on. It wasn't part of the task force. It had failed to make it through. So we were at this committee meeting. We weren't elected yet. We were already elected, but we hadn't taken the oath yet. This is in June and we get up, we make our case and talk about a rec center in Westwood and which hopefully we can see. One day Carla gets up and she says, We need a rec center in central Denver. And she did it with such eloquence. And lo and behold, there it was on the bond. I was so happy for her. She and I spent a lot of time together. We were in New Orleans at the National League of Cities, and that's where I really understood who Carter Madison was. Now, Carla would say, Oh, I woke up on that balcony one time. And that's my favorite gumbo shop. Oh. And then we walking up and down Bourbon Street, and she had a paper cup with bourbon in it, and it was very nice. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You can drink it. Walk down the street here. And she was talking about the design in New Orleans, and she took me to her favorite gumbo shop, and she had my palm read and all kinds of crazy, weird stuff that I had never think I'd ever do. But I did it with Carla Metz, and those are the memories I had. And the way she led her district was amazing. And she was the first one in a long time, the first white woman. To be elected in Council District eight in a while. That's right. And although there was a lot of buzz and a lot of criticism, I never heard that one bit from her district. They loved her. Everybody loved her. It was Carla madison. And she was orange, right. She was an amazing city councilwoman to work with. And one day I remember. Finding out that I had been diagnosed with a stage two cancer. And I was scared out of my mind. I have a daughter. I'm from as young as, I think 31 years old. And I was so scared. She came up to me. And I didn't realize that she had had cancer in the past. And she says, I want to. I want you to. Does this remember something she told me in the parking lot? And she pulled me aside and she says, Paul. You can't fear the lesson. Out of fear of the teacher. You can't pass that lesson out of fear. The teacher. And cancer has been a great teacher in my life. And there she was, a hotter balloonist. She got up and taught us how to do massage therapy right here on the council floor. She'd ride around in her crazy scooter, and she was just so full of life this woman had. She was the. She had done everything in her lifetime. And she says it's through that that I learned to live. And those are the best words I've ever heard in my life. Right. And I think of her sitting at this desk. And I see her and I feel her in these chambers. And there's no I agree with you. There's no other way to name this rec center than for my colleague. Harlem, Madison. So this is a joyous day. And I just I just I'm thrilled. I'm happy because I know she's alive and. The design of the rec center. Somebody please make it orange. So thank you. Thank you for the opportunity to serve. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah, it's going to be less personal and more more matter of fact. But I do want to throw out distillery and palm reader reading as possible options for that retail space on. Okay. So I would like to thank everyone who worked on this project. The naming process can be very complex and time consuming, but in the end, very, very rewarding. Carla Madison's legacy will live on allowing people from all walks of life to learn how she helped make Denver an amazing place. The Carla Madison Rec Center will welcome will be a welcome demand for the Colfax corridor. I had an opportunity to work across the street from the site, directly across the street for several years. And I know firsthand how impactful this recreation center will be for the surrounding community and Denver as a whole. Both are important, as you have demonstrated to Carla. I would also like to thank Councilwoman Jeannie Robb for her contribution in moving this project forward. I feel honored to be part of the naming process offered and I'm by offering my full support this evening. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman Nu. I first met Karl at the ANC and you can always tell a special person because when Carl came into the room, I can remember the zoning meetings we'd have over Mike Henry's condo building and. And her presence was just something special. It's like you knew when she walked in the room that there was something unique about Carla. And as we talked about it and found out she was going to run for city council, everybody was so pleased. Here's somebody that's going to really represent our citizens in our neighborhoods. We really love that about her. And so it was so wonderful. And we all said, not only is she going to represent our neighborhoods, but we need some of that orange hair on city council. There's no question about it. She was wonderful and a wonderful personally, but very sincere, always sincere. So, Paul, you had a, you know, a lucky woman to be with and she also had a lucky man to have supporting her as well. So I just look forward to voting for this designation. And it would be a wonderful tribute to Carla. Councilman. Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I also want to express my support for the naming of this rec center after Carlo Madsen. I did not serve with her, but I did have an opportunity to work with her when I worked over at the Denver Department of Human Services as the first director of our homeless commission. And one of my job responsibilities was to move around our temporary shelter, which, you know, we're still doing in this city, as we've seen more and more homeless people on the streets. But I had an occasion to meet with her at her office. She was always very welcoming, had it decorated with just incredible art throughout her office. It was almost like walking into a gallery and I remember going on a bike ride with her and Councilwoman Judy Monteiro, and I think she was the original cruiser that started out, the cruisers that are now, what, 300 plus on Wednesday nights during warm weather. I think, Carlos, when they got everybody going on that I think this is very, very appropriate to be naming this building after her because of her incredible advocacy and love not only for the neighborhoods that she served, but this entire city. She exaggerated that in in the way that she interacted with people. And I'm just pleased to be able to vote yes for this naming tonight, because I think it will give people in the community pride to walk in that building and know that it was a local community leader that helped make that happen for this community that has needed a recreation center in this area of town for for a long, long time. So I'll be a yes vote tonight. Thank you. Thank you. You, Councilwoman. I take it, Councilwoman Gilmore. Thank you, Mr. President. You know. I didn't know her personally, but I have to say that her legacy lives on very bright. And I think the positioning of the rec center in the close proximity to East High School, you know, a lot of people throughout life want to conform and be normal. And for someone who sees that normal is boring to her and that she really embraced, I think, what life is really supposed to be about. And I was honored, you know, to to definitely have Paul's support during my campaign, but then also her family being here tonight. And I really want to recognize you for being here as well and being able to listen to all of this. And, you know, just knowing that that close proximity for East High School students and for students along, you know, in the area to know really who Karla madison was and that art and not conforming is okay in life and especially for young women to know that it's okay to be who you want to be and that in a lot of ways you don't need to be normal. You just need to be who you truly are in life. And so I couldn't be more happy to support this tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Any other comments from members of council? I will I will share one. I was I only had a handful of interactions with with Carla, which is certainly unfortunate. But I remember the ones that I have been so powerful and I I'll start off by thinking it's probably safe to assume that Carla and I are a contrast. You know, they said that Carla Carla was funky, and that's probably something I only heard after a two week field exercise out in the military. You know, they say that she was a free spirit and at times people can define me as rigid. She had orange hair. I have none. But it's interesting. I remember when I first set up a meeting with her was when I was actually campaigning. And with all these differences we had. Carla had the unique ability of just making you feel comfortable no matter who you were. And I remember as a half an hour meeting and we talked for almost 2 hours, and some things I remember that I won't share was just my conversation with her about being an underdog and why I wanted to run. And one thing that I absolutely believe we had in common is the heart of service. And I think that's something that resonated between the two of us about why we were running, the things we felt we wanted to do. And I, I just always remember that conversation that we had, and she was such a inspiration for me after that conversation to continue to run with the circumstances I was going against. But I also remember, too, in that conversation where she said to me, Do you have pets? And I do. And I talked about my my stray lucky who my stray dog. Lucky who I got from the Fort Sill Pound. And then we just talked about dog for the next 30 minutes and just our love for animals and just all the things that we in our this disdain for particular legislation that regards the dogs . And we said if we get together, we're going to we're going to fight to work that. And it was just a great conversation. And it's just somebody that when I walked out, I just felt just felt so good about. And when I learned of how she was ill and how she has her circumstances, it was just really unfortunate. But, you know, no one can doubt that Carla lived. And that is something that always resonate to me and never do take any day for granted. So I am truly touched by her and the interactions that we had, even though they are so few. And I'm really honored to vote yes on 84 as well. So so you know the comments, Madam Secretary, roll call. Brooks. I for Carla. Clark. Hi. Espinosa. Hi, Flynn. I Gilmore I Cashman. Absolutely. I can eat. Lopez named Carla. I knew Carla. Ortega. Hi. Absolutely. Black. Hi, Mr. President.

Thank you. Motion carries a mixed item. I'm 27 as a report from Development Services with the recommendation to adopt the recommended revisions to the city's Mills Act property tax incentive program for properties. Okay. There's a motion by Vice Mayor Lowenthal and a seconded by Councilman Richardson. Any public comment on this item? I do have some some speakers. So let me let me do the public comment and then I'll go to the council for speakers. Please come forward. Good evening. Mayor Garcia and members of the city council. My name is Donna Sievers. I'm the vice president of the Bluff Heights Neighborhood Association. And after my own personal comments, I'd also like to share several comments with you from John Thomas, the president of our neighborhood association. Unfortunately, John is ill this evening, and he asked to have me also speak on his behalf. So I'm going to go very quickly. I'm pleased to be able to speak to you tonight in support of the Mills Act and hope you will unanimously vote to renew the Mills Act contracts, which will surely benefit the historical integrity of our city for decades to come. I first became interested in the Mills Act when my husband and I purchased a home on Vista Street four years ago because our house is now 100 years old and was in need of significant repairs. We had hoped for property tax relief to help finance many of those repairs. When I contacted our then city councilman, Gary DeLong, in 2011th November 2011, I was dismayed to hear that Long Beach had discontinued some new mills that contracts as the program has such merit. So I applaud the staff for their work regarding the reinstatement of the Mills Act and hope this recommendation does meet with your approval. I do hope, however, that you will consider other suggestions on who would benefit and be given priority for these contracts. I would like to suggest that while it appears reasonable to give priority to houses who are in need of significant restoration, I would also urge you to consider contracts for those newer homeowners like myself who pay a significantly higher property tax and therefore may have difficulty maintaining their homes over the next decades. In the city of Santa Ana, for example, awards for mills that contracts are given to homes that are in relatively good condition in order that the homeowner can continue to maintain their property. I believe if you only provide mills that contracts to those properties that are in major or total disrepair, you would be inadvertently providing a huge negative incentive to those of us who have taken all of our expendable income and maintained our homes. Those of us with high property tax rates and who are also on fixed incomes should be provided. Consideration and Future Mills Act so that our homes are not the neglected ones and will not deteriorate over time. When I researched the Long Beach Mills Act properties, I was also dismayed to see that 76% of the homes were were three multi family residents the Villa Riviera, the Lafayette and the El Cordova Apartments. While only 24% of the former contracts were given to single family homes. I would hope that our city would now more aggressively support single family residents in any future. Mills Act. So I'm going to skip over to John's comments real quick. John would like me to share with you that he hopes the application process will be streamlined and that a reduction in the fee to accomplish both the Landmarking and the Mills Act application would be appropriate. John also suggested that 100% of the. Owners of an H-2A must. Participate in order to for the property to be considered with the Mills Act. And he also supports the concept that a limited number of commercial nonresidential buildings be considered for mills that contracts. Finally, John and I would both like to share with you that despite any loss of revenue associated with the Mills Act, the benefit to the city of Long Beach will far outweigh that loss of revenue and will result in the preservation of our city's landmark structures. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Mayor Councilperson. My name is Maureen Neeley. I live on Termino Avenue in the third district. I'm speaking tonight as both a board member of Long Beach Heritage and a vice president of the Belmont Heights Community Association. Both groups are heartened to see the renewed interest by the city for an active, historic, landmark program and reinstatement of the Mills Act. However, both of the two historic districts in Belmont Heights, as well as Long Beach Heritage, have asked that the council review the proposed fees associated with the new ordinance for Landmarking and Mills Act applications. As proposed, the historic landmark application fee is over $900 to apply for the Mills Act. The cost is 1100 dollars per unit. On the face of it. Those costs don't look too terrible. And we recognize that Development Services seeks to pay for staff time by attributing fees. That's practical. However, these same fees may hamper the embrace of these tools by the very communities they are intending to help. In particular, single family homes and commercial properties must be identified as historic landmarks before they are eligible for the Mills Act. These two processes alone will cost over $2,000 for the property owner, with no guarantee the property will attain either status. Please consider reworking this section with either a partial return of fees or a pre-approval process before much time and money is invested. In addition, because staff time could be streamlined, a combo fee for applying for both of these could be preferred. The 1100 dollars fee for the Mills Act application is per unit. Right now, this is particularly onerous for owners of apartment homes as they cannot charge their tenants for the fee on each unit. Please consider reworking this cost, especially given that staff would only be working with one owner. One application. As a benchmark, local cities such as Pasadena, San Clemente and Los Angeles all use much lower fee structures to incentivize participation. So in closing, we know that a city like ours with numerous historic landmarks and numerous property owners using tax savings to restore their unique buildings, is a city filled with rich architecture, conscientious owners and a close knit, functioning city of neighborhoods. These are the very attributes that attract good business a creative class of residents and families seeking healthy, clean communities. Incentives such as those that we are discussing, go a long way to achieving these goals. Let's tweak the good base presented here tonight with the just a few adjustments to really get landmarking and the Mills Act working for all of Long Beach. Thank you. Good evening. Excuse me, Mayor. Council people. My name is Karen Berger. I live in California Heights, the city's largest historic district. And I was speaking on behalf of the board of directors of California Heights, its residents, and also as a member of the board of Long Beach Heritage. It's been a long time coming. The reinstatement of the Mills Act, it was initially suspended in 2006. That was the last time a contract had been approved. We applaud the fact that the city is moving in this direction. The existing contracts have been reviewed and we're pushing towards reinstatement. I also have concerns about the fees as the previous ordinance was written. If you were a contributing property in a historic district, you could apply for a Mills Act contract with a new proposal. Every home or building that applies for the Mills Out contract must also be listed as a landmark in the city of Long Beach. This basically almost doubles the fee for anybody who lives in a historic district. A lot of residents in our historic district, California Heights and the 16 other historic districts try to apply. The program was suspended and they have been patiently waiting for upwards of eight years for it to come back. And I think the fee structure needs to be investigated, it needs to be reviewed and comparisons to Los Angeles, Pasadena for either a sliding fee scale, maybe a smaller initial application. And then if you are able to achieve landmark status, move into the Mills Act. But as the previous speaker stated, to have upwards of $2,000 in fees paid upfront with no option of any refund is very discouraging to people in the historic districts. So I would encourage the support of the Mills Act. I would like to see a little bit of fine tuning of the fee structure and how it's positioned and also to speak to comparisons to the city of Anaheim. The city of Anaheim, currently as of 2014, has 286 mills that contracts. Long Beach has 34. So we have a lot of catching up to do to be basically relative to cities of a similar size and population. Thank you for your time. Thank you. And before the next speaker comes up. Ms.. BURDICK, I'm wondering if that I know that we have had discussions about the issue that our Speaker just mentioned regarding the fee for applicants for landmark status and the Mills Act participation. So is that something that you're considering right now? Yes, certainly. Madam Vice Mayor, members of the city council, we are looking at a potential combination fee, which I think was the term that was used, that if we are moving forward with both the Mills Act and the landmarking request, at the same time, we think that there is some cost savings that can be produced. We would analyze that and come back to the City Council when the master fee schedule is amended, which is currently scheduled for sometime in March. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Don. Denniston. I rise in opposition to the Mills Act. My understanding that something like a 10%. Discount on loans. For historic buildings. However, anything is considered historic. If you have a family there, it's done. It's really kind of a gimmick. The they get they get access to the loans if it had sentimental value, if they had a family living there. And furthermore. The architecture is not rich being replaced. Replacement means. New. New means rich. The architecture of the past. Has been surpassed. By other buildings more beautiful. Not only that, but it will encourage more construction. Ask the people living next to these historic homes. Why would they rather have a renovated home next to them or a brand new home, or maybe even a parking lot? Thank you, Mr. Dunn. Next speaker, please. Very good as the address. I would strongly disagree with the previous speaker. I think. Ole, ole, ole helms can remain very, very attractive and are an asset to the neighborhood. As I stated last week, when we were looking at the new design of the city, what's projected for the city hall, in my view, that's not ugly. There are some people that like that type of style. But. There's also homes that are I recognize that are homes that are modern style different than older homes. But I think one of the biggest assets this city has is its architectural diversity, and particularly the historic the older buildings. They add character to it. Right now, you want as I said last week or two weeks ago. What you're now proposing. I just. I know I don't want to get off too much in a tangent, but the modern buildings you're proposing here look nothing more than it's a duplicate of Parker Center downtown. So to whatever extent you have the capacity to help restore. Some of the of any old, older building. I think it's is an asset and it's money well spent in this city should concentrate on that and help people do that in any way they can. And it also pumps up the economy because you've got you've got people that are trades craftsmen that are specialized in that. And those are not always hard to find. So forth. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. Seeing no further speakers. I'll take it behind the rail. Councilmember Gonzalez Actually, there's only been a maker of the motion. Is there a seconder? Councilmember Gonzalez. Thank you. I first want to thank Amy and her team because this has been a really comprehensive plan, but it's something that I've been hearing for so long, especially having three of the 17 districts, historic districts in my in my district. It's been a long time coming. And so thank you for just being open and being able to answer a lot of our questions regarding regarding the Mills Act. I just wanted to clarify, though, you did say that you would bring back information on a masterpiece schedule and information regarding whether we can combine or reduce some fees. Yes, ma'am, that's correct. The master fee schedule is scheduled to come back sometime in March, and we would look to get an item on there where we can do a combined fee because we do need to keep the fees separate right now because we do have existing landmarks in the city that are not do not have Mills Act contracts. So we still do need to keep the fees separate. We've looked at our fee schedule for what they are now and then we do incorporate full cost recovery. So I'm not able to recommend at this point any reduction in those fees without asking for a subsidy from the general fund. But I will be coming back to you with the master fee schedule update with a combination fee. Okay, great. And I know that there had been some talk about the reduction in the general fund, about 100 and something thousand dollars. But was there a projected projected revenue from this at all? And I mean, can we even foresee what that might be? There really isn't. Revenue per say that is generated to the city. I think it might enhance the the value of the property and we might recoup some of that. We spent a lot of time talking to the L.A. County assessor on how they handled Mills Act contracts countywide. And the the contracts are really negligible in terms of of what they will affect the general fund on. This is a worst case scenario that we provided you up to $200,000 a year if we were to able to to process all of these contracts within the first five years. So I don't think that the hit to the general fund is really going to be anything that's negligible. It's not significant at all, which is good. Okay. And the participation from the highways and we discuss that a little bit. I had asked you about that. And can you just touch on that a little bit more just so we can get a clear picture of how that may look? Correct. Right now, we have three units, three buildings that have multiple units in them. And not all of those buildings, not all of the units within those buildings participate. It makes that extremely difficult for the highway. And it sets up. Inequity between the individual unit owners. We would like to give priority to those buildings as well that have partial or a partial compliance. And we would recommend as part of this that going forward that 100% of the units in a multi-unit building must participate with the involvement of the HRA. The individual tax benefit will still derive to the individual unit owner, but the ATO is typically going to be the one that's going to be implementing building wide improvements, such as replacing windows or painting or repointing the brick. So it really is beneficial to have the H-2A involved and act as the agent to all the individual unit owners. Great. Okay. Those are all my questions. Thank you very much. Councilmember Mongo. Councilmember Price. Sorry. Councilmember Mongo. I think misspoke, did an excellent job discussing the assessor's side of it. I pulled up the website to give that out as an opportunity once people received their Middlesex contracts. How they can apply for their exemptions. Councilman Price. Thank you. And I apologize. I misspoke. I was talking to the mayor while you were answering the vice mayor question. So I don't know if you answered this, but one of the speakers raised what I thought was a good point about what happens if someone doesn't qualify. Can you address that? If you have already, I apologize, but I didn't hear it. I did not address that answer. But that's typically something that we work through. Even on regular applications, there is an ability for the city to refund processing fees up to a certain percent if it's going to be a failed application. We typically do not like to bring failed applications forward. It creates an environment of negativity for both the city and for the business or the property owner. So if we have reached a point in the process where we thought that a Mills Act contract would not be viable or that. Landmarking would not be viable, we would stop that process and really. Ask them if they wanted to relieve themselves of the process and then they would be eligible for a partial refund. But we have standard. Procedures for doing that in. The municipal code. So those were just apply here as well. And I know I reached out to you, it was either very late last night or early this morning. I'm not sure about I'm not sure either. It may have been sometime after midnight, but my my question was about the fees in particular. And again, I apologize if you've answered it, but as you've explained it to me, this is purely a cost recovery fee, correct? We do have current fees for both the Mills Act and the landmarking. We would ask. That those remain as is because it is pure cost. Recovery. But I did suggest that we could come back with a combination fee for new applications and we would come back as part of the master fee schedule update in a couple of months. And what what do you envision the combination fee? What would you envision included in that? We would I can't tell you what that. Fee would be without doing the analysis. We literally estimate the entire process and how much staff time it would take to go through the entire process. But since it would be essentially two processes and a lot of the information is very similar in terms of the program of improvements that they're going to be making and the background research of the building and whether it would qualify as a landmark. There's a lot of overlap in that research and that's where we can do the fee reduction. In terms of that fee not knowing what it's going to be. Is it is it fair to assume that that, too, is going to be purely a cost recovery? Absolutely. We don't offer any other fees except for cost recovery. We're not allowed to do that. And we're not in a position at this at this point to be able to absorb the costs associated with that in our current budget. That is correct. We we have to do cost recovery or I would have to ask for a subsidy from the general fund. Absent a subsidy from the general fund, is there any other way for this program to go forward? Just the fees that are charged? Yes. Okay. Thank you. I have a very long thought to have it queued up once more. Okay. I actually took a pass while I was in your seat. So I wanted to just ask a question myself. I think this may have been addressed, but please remind me one of the original concerns regarding reinstating the Mills Act program was the ability to confirm what residents were doing, what type of work that they were doing, and how their tax reductions were spent, whether on restoring or maintaining the restored property. And so you I trust that you're confident that with the reintroduction of the new program, you will have an opportunity and able staff to monitor those property investments? Yes, ma'am. We've learned quite a lot from doing the reviews of the existing contracts, and we've also learned what makes a good contract and the documentation that's required. So a new applicant would be required to provide us with a program of reinvestment into the property. And we would suggest that the majority of the time those improvements are going to be to the exterior of a building and not in the interior. The value of the mills art contract is that that it should be restoring things that are viewed by the public or within the public realm. And so, you know, a landmark building that has a publicly accessible lobby that is also called out in the landmarking ordinance for that building, they could clearly qualify and use the Mills Act subsidy to make investments in that public lobby. But if it was a private unit with private improvements on the interior, the value of that for an exchange for the public subsidy is is clearly diminished. So when the owner comes forward and they show us and document the value of the improvements that they intend to make, that is actually part of the contract. And the contract allows us to do an annual inspection if we so choose. The state law does require us to do it periodically, and so we are required to do that periodically now under recent revisions to state law. And so that's something that we must do. Thank you and I appreciate that. I wanted to share that. I'm very pleased to see this program return. I know the hiatus was quite lengthy and and I appreciate the staff work that's gone into bringing us back this program. In this iteration, our office receives inquiries about the Mills Act on a regular basis, which isn't too surprising given the number of historic districts and high rises in District two. I appreciate the input that we have from members of the historic preservation community, such as John Thomas and Anna maria McGowan and the individuals who came to speak before us today. Thank you to each of you that has been here, and I know you've been here through the entire process. What we might lose in the immediate tax revenue at the city level, which we had our staff identify a few moments ago, I know that we'll certainly gain this in community and corridor character and ultimately increased property values in the future as these gems are restored and our city's rich history is told through its architecture. And that's the beauty of Long Beach. You have many, many neighborhoods, whether historic or not, but really many neighborhoods, one great city. And I think this reinstating this program will help us restore that and be able to tell that narrative from our streetscape. One of the interesting things about our city that's different from I think other cities is a lot of our home frontages they do front out into the street scape in a way that other cities don't as openly. We're sort of that that inside out as opposed to the other way and you have a lot of alcoves and and nooks and other cities where you don't see the character of the homes as as quickly as you do in Long Beach. And Long Beach is different that way. I don't know that we're specifically unique, but in driving through other major cities, I do notice that that's a difference here. And so to be able to allow residents to tap into this when possible in order to restore and and ensure that we we preserve the character of our architecture, it's important. So I'm really appreciative of the inclusion of of the nonresidential or commercial buildings in the program under a certain threshold. I think that's very important. There are many historic commercial buildings that contribute to our city's historic fabric. And given all the hard work that we put into our adaptive reuse policy, which took us a few years to bring online, we know that the city's commercial building may end up being tomorrow's residential building. And so I'm very grateful for that, that we have the foresight working with the stakeholders to see that and be able to put that in. So again, thank you to our staff for your due diligence, Miss Burdick, especially you and your team. You've seen this through for several years. And so with that, I do support this recommendation and staff's commitment to looking at a reduction in the combined application fees. And I'm thankful that you're looking at that. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. That that concludes both the council and public comment. There is a motion by Vice Mayor Lowenthal on a second by Councilwoman Gonzalez. Please cast your vote. The motion carries eight votes. Next item.",Recommendation to adopt recommended revisions to the City’s Mills Act Property Tax Incentive Program for historic properties.  (Citywide),"Here is a concise summary of the key points from the presentation:

The council was considering reinstating the Mills Act property tax incentive program to encourage restoration and preservation of historic buildings in Long Beach. The main components were:

- Adopting recommended revisions to enable new Mills Act contracts, which provide property tax reductions for owners who renovate and maintain historic properties.

- Requiring 100% participation from units in multi-family historic buildings to receive the contracts.  

- Allowing a limited number of non-residential/commercial historic buildings to qualify.

- Setting application fees to recover city costs - around $900 for landmark application and $1,100 per unit for Mills Act application.

Public speakers welcomed reinstatement of the program but raised concerns about the proposed fee levels, especially the upfront costs before approval. They suggested combining fees, sliding scales, or partial refunds if applications are denied. 

Council members acknowledged the community benefits of preserving historic character through the Mills Act incentives. However, they asked staff to consider a combined fee option at a lower cost for handling the landmark and Mills Act processes together.

Overall, there was support for adopting the program revisions while directing staff to further evaluate and potentially reduce the fee structure to encourage more participation, especially from single-family homeowners. The council voted 8-0 to approve the recommendations.",0.83,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly by reasoning freely about the core message, flow of ideas, and underlying context first.

Report from Development Services Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record and include the public hearing. Declare Ordinance Amending Title five Regulation of Businesses, Trades and Professions. Read the first time and later vote in the next regular meeting for the City Council for Final Reading. Declare an ordinance approving a zoning code amendment amending Title 21 zoning regulations. Read the first time and later the next regular meeting of City Council for Final Reading and adopt a resolution authorizing City Manager to submit the local Coastal Program Amendment to the Coastal California Coastal Commission for its review citywide. This item is a short term rental proposed modifications. I'd like to turn it over to staff. Linda Tatum. I'd like to introduce I like to introduce the planning manager. Patricia Defender for to make a brief. Staff presentation on this item. You do so much. And good evening, members of the city council. Patricia, Defender for Planning Bureau Manager. Can you hear me okay? Yes. Okay, great. This item before you is the approval of a California Coastal Commission, modifications to the city's short term rentals ordinance that was adopted by the City Council in late 2020. The Coastal Commission modifications do not materially change the ordinance as proposed as approved by City Council. They do not change the overall cap on UNHOSTED units citywide and generally represent procedural changes that pertain to properties in the coastal zone, which I will describe in more detail in later slides. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. Thank you. Following is a brief history of this ordinance. On June 23rd, 2020, the ordinance to add Chapter 5.77 to the municipal code to regulate short term rentals was approved at that time, only hosted short term rentals were permitted under that ordinance. Subsequently, in December of 2020, the City Council adopted modifications to the original ordinance that allowed Unhosted short term rentals. On September 4th, 2020, and again on December 30th, 2020, the city submitted the short term rental ordinance and the revised ordinance to the California Coastal Commission, which requires an amendment to the city's adopted local coastal program. The local coastal program is comprised of the Land Use Plan and the implementation program, which are the ordinances that implement the the the land use plan. The implementation program is generally comprised of Title 21 Zoning Code and Title 22 subdivision code of the City's Municipal Code. And amendments to these chapters of the Municipal Code require approval and certification by the Coastal Commission in order to be effective in the city's coastal zone. The OCR, for those in the short term rentals ordinance, is a section in the Title 25 of the Municipal Code, which regulates businesses in the city. Given the overlap between regulating the short term rentals and land use and the Coastal Commission's authority to ensure access to the coast, the short term rentals ordinance similarly requires review and certification by the Coastal Commission and will be incorporated in the city's certified local coastal program. On December 15th, 2021, the Coastal Commission held a hearing on the local Coastal Program Amendment and required for modifications, the approval of which are before the City Council this evening. Next slide, please. Procedurally, the city has six months from the Coastal Commission's December action to adopt these modifications and resubmit the revised ordinance to the Coastal Commission for Final Certification. Once those steps are complete, the short term rental ordinance will be effective in the coastal zone. Next slide, please. Following is a summary of the modifications that are proposed. The first modification is the requirement for that a 350 non primary unhosted number of short term rentals be maintained in the coastal zone in order to maintain a level of short term rentals similar to those historic levels of short term run short term rentals that were in the coastal zone. As previously mentioned, the Coastal Commission action does not change the fees adopted citywide cap of 800 unhosted short term rentals and the Coastal Commission modification does clarify that the citywide cap cannot be used to limit the number of short term rentals in the coastal zone to less than 350. However, the city will be monitoring the 800 unit cap, including through a requirement to provide an annual report to the City Council and South will come back to the City Council if it appears that the city will exceed the cap. The second modification any prohibitions on short term rentals, either buildings or centers, block groups in the coastal zone would be required to obtain a local coastal development permit, and findings in support of those requirements have to be met, and I will describe those findings in a later slide. This is the main procedural change that will result from these modifications. The third modification establishes a periodic review by the Coastal Commission of Restrictions on short term rentals that are approved by the city to ensure that there are no cumulative impacts to public access to the coast. Finally, the fourth and last modification pertains to a commitment to non discriminatory services and ADA access as part of the registration process to maximize public access for all people. Next slide, please. The next few slides provide some sample scenarios related to the restrictions to short term rentals that are intended to be allowed by the short term rental ordinance. The ordinance does provide the ability of property owners to initiate a petition process to prohibit short term rentals within a census block group, to compare the current process with the process that would result from the proposed Coastal Commission modifications. Currently, the ordinance would require the property owner to complete a successful petition process and then be added on the list of restricted areas. With the proposed ordinance modifications, property owners will have to complete a successful petition process as they would under the current ordinance, that they would also have to obtain a local coastal development permit. If the findings can be made in the positive and the local coastal development permit is approved, then they will be added to the list of restricted areas for unhosted short term rentals. Next slide, please. Similarly, procedures would apply in order for individual buildings to be added to the list of prohibited buildings in which unhosted short term rentals are prohibited. The current ordinance would require the property owner to apply to be on the prohibited buildings list and then once on the list, the short term rental restriction would be enforced. With the proposed ordinance modifications, property owners will have to apply to be listed on the prohibited buildings list. They would then be required to obtain a local coastal development permit, which does require a hearing. If the findings can be made in the positive and the local coastal development permit is approved, then they will be added to the list of prohibited buildings and that in the short term, rental restriction will be enforced. Buildings that have restricted affordable units, which are not eligible to be short term rentals, as well as buildings with restrictive covenants that prohibit short term rentals or their equivalent dating back to before January 1st, 1977, and which pre-date the Coastal Act, would be exempt from this procedure and may be listed on the prohibited buildings list without the procedure. Next slide, please. Shown on this slide are the findings that would have to be made to grant the local coastal development permit to restrict short term rentals in the census block group group, or to place a building on the prohibited buildings list. The proposed modifications so you can see the restriction would be there would be findings that they would not include a cumulative impact to access to short term rentals and access to the coast for habitat restrictions would not result in substantial loss of visitor serving accommodations. They would not result in the loss of lower cost overnight accommodations. The proposed restrictions would not result in the net loss of short term, short term rentals. Below 425 short term rentals, which is comprised of both hosted and unhosted short term rentals, which are historic, which historically occur in the coastal zone, and the proposed restriction would not would be necessary to protect the neighborhood's stability. So these are the findings that would have to be made in order to approve the restrictions on short term rentals. Next slide, please. So these are the next steps that are required upon City Council approval. City staff will resubmit the revisions to the California Coastal Commission within the six months in order to meet the timeframes required by law. The Coastal Commission will then certify and ensure that the amendment is consistent with the original action of the Coastal Commission and that upon certification, the ACR ordinance will be in effect in the coastal zone . Next slide, please. The recommendation is that the city council accepts the California Coastal Commission, propose modifications and finalized the Coastal Commission certification process for the ACR ordinance as an amendment to the local coastal program. That concludes staff recommendation and staff is available to answer any questions that the Council might have. Thank you. I think we should stick with the council. We do have a motion from our Councilmember Price, seconded by Councilmember Jurado, and we do have some comment from council, but with I think we should go to public comment first, if that's okay. I'd like to do that. They're okay with the maker of the motion. Okay. Clark is a Republican. If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature or Dallas Star nine. Daniel Wilson. Your time begins now. You have 90 seconds. Good evening, Honorable Council members. My name is Daniel Wilson and I'm speaking on behalf of Unite your Local 11. Tonight, you have a rare opportunity amid an unprecedented global crisis that has wrecked your tourism industry. And as the city faces down a mandate to build nearly 27,000 units of housing over the next eight years, you can start bleeding your existing housing stock by encouraging them to be converted into party houses and luxury tourist rentals. We do not agree with the staff's presentation of this language that it would not increase the cap. That is absolutely not correct. We urge you tonight to reject the Coastal Commission's changes to your ordinance that allow 1150 units of housing to be converted into short term rentals. FDR are an existential threat to hotel workers. They take housing away from working people and displaced their jobs. At the last council meeting, this council unanimously stated that hotel and janitorial workers jobs are a priority by passing recall and retention. This week, you are considering whether to allow those same hotel workers jobs to be taken away by the short term rental market. This is the Uber, Lyft and Amazon of our industry. Please stand with the hard, hardworking hotel workers who build your tourism economy by rejecting these changes today and adopt a primary residence requirement to stop the. Bleeding of the city's housing stock. Thank you. Next speaker, we have Nancy Hannah. Your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. My name is Nancy Hanna. I am an attorney, and I work with better neighbors, L.A. and the city council should reject. The commission suggested modifications to expand the cap of Unhosted non primary non primary residences and dedicated short term rental properties. The short term rental ordinance was originally passed by Long Beach, had a cap of 800 units that would be allowed to be taken off the market and dedicated short term rentals. And now they're considering extending that cap by 43% to allow it to increase to 1150. I categorically disagree with the staff characterization of this modification, saying that they will not increase the cap. The plain language of the proposed modification does exactly that. I heard the staff say that they intend to monitor the cap, although it is very clear there is no plan for what to do if we reach a point that there is a registration beyond 800 as Long Beach going to start kicking out registered users or how will you claw back that cap? Also, please keep in mind that this monitoring and any response to it is not included in the language of these modifications or this ordinance. And so, in effect, this is just a placebo. And the actual language that the city council today is considering adopting is to increase the number of housing units that will be taken off of the housing market. Thank you. Next speaker, we have Rockwell Lezama. Rick. How? See, when I started this production. De la France, I bought France. They were interpreting the color France. When I started at the concert hall. Good afternoon. All the members from the council. I mean, I'm basically summer, so I try to stay out for the assignments. My name is regular. Sam and I have been working in the hotel industry for the last ten years. Then go to their own checker party. I got a migraine, so. I had the need to use a health check and half of the other check in order to cover my rent. Kirkpatrick Yes, my character is still in control. There be trouble. Not only that, rent is very expensive, but it's very difficult for me to find housing close to my job. Yes. To Sarkozy. They can just see apartments, can competition, arbitration, as you say. And that is due to the fact that many homes and apartment rooms have become it became a hotel rentals. Oh, yes. I keep I rapidly up to Apollo. I'm here to ask for your support in order to stop the London. Which are scandalous cambio de la commission cos they run Israeli. And for you to reject the changes made for from the Coastal Commission into the new law. But it also means more destruction. They cost us the apartments, we sell them. So that is the the familiar. We need to stop the destruction of houses and apartments and the elimination of homes for many families. Debi Mazar, similarly Iraqi theater, the residency principal in Ciudad de Los Angeles. So we had to copy the law that Los Angeles have regarding primary residence parameters that they have in Los Angeles. But I put their faith in their success, gets Ben Affleck banned. Also God is the Lord is gracious to. Stop the creation of those hundreds of party houses that are affecting really workers that work in our city. Thank you very much. Next speaker is Leona Noble. Good evening, counsel. I'm speaking on behalf of Billy Bray. And we also ask the council to reject the Coastal Commission recommendations and the recommendation of staff. We strongly disagree that the proposed. Changes won't present a problem for the residents and workers here in the city. Of Long Beach. At the very moment that we continue to see outrageous. Escalations in rents. 32% in my neighborhood. And in other neighborhoods, it's even worse. Those rent increases are going to be escalated if you approve. This increase. In. Airbnbs because you are going to decrease the available rental units. This is also the wrong time, in our opinion, for you to do this, because unfortunately, the federal, the state and the local rent subsidies and assistance being. Provided to our neighbors who. Are renters. Is ending. Literally in a matter. Of weeks. Now is not the time to further destabilize rental housing here in Long Beach. And we ask you to please. Thank you, Susan Bailey. Your time begins. Now. Thank you. Thank you. Members of council. I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight. I live in Long Beach in the coastal zone at 161 Glendora in Suzy's district. My husband and I split our time between Long Beach and Denver. Our home has never been used as a permanent long term rental. Because we use it more than half the year. And I believe the Coastal. Commission's recommendations. Are thoughtfully considered, have been reviewed, carefully, coexist with all the important forms of lodging, including the hotel lodging industry. Which is equally important. But short term rentals are places that people come and stay in neighborhoods. Near their families. They're typically in different districts, not always in hotel districts. And most importantly, they offer people an opportunity to come with their family, to cook in a kitchen. To have an affordable place to access the coast. And I would urge you to think through the very thoughtful recommendations presented by the Coastal Commission, which I believe are in keeping with council's prior ordinance and actually can coexist quite effectively. Thank you for your time. Next speaker is Araceli King. Your 90 seconds begins now. And even in council tonight, I won't be representing Latinos in action in California. We are. Actually through our organization, you know, on the rejection of the Coastal Commission recommendations of Long Beach Ordinance. 30. Zero zero 34 due to the increase of the rentals that. Are going to be in in here. And also, we have a that the language is increasingly becoming, you know, unaffordable for residents. For visitors who want to enjoy the coastline is fine. But we think that, you know, it's going to take a lot of job and and everything from the people that is going to come and work for the hotels. So we are actually, you know, asking you to please check and verify these things. We work with. Like a lot of the. Community that is working into those areas. We think that we have to think about this and make sure that we are not going to be, you know. Misusing all the when I took the picture. The resources that we have into making our city better. By, you know. Losing a lot of jobs for our own people. Thank you so much for letting me, you know, share what we were thinking about and really appreciate what you guys do. Thank you. Melody Osuna. Your time begins now. Good. Good evening, counsel. And my name is Melody Osuna. I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. I'm also a resident of District eight. We LaFlamme The Legal Aid Foundation, Los Angeles provides technical assistance and legal support to Long Beach tenants and community organizers. And as such, we take a great deal of interest in the affordability of the housing stock in the city. I first want to point out that we disagree with the staff report that. States the changes will not affect the 800 cap. It's simple math. If there are 800 short term rentals outside the coastal zone, this change allows 350 more rentals in the city, reaching 1150 short term rentals. As we shared with the Coastal Commission in December 2021. When it considered Long Beach expansion of short term rentals. In the coastal zone, we believe this ordinance will make. It more. Difficult for low and moderate income residents. Of Long Beach to stay housed within the coastal area. It's well-settled that short term rentals drive up the cost of housing stock for residents. Like other forms of. Gentrification, the effect of short. Term rentals is that they increase the value of an area at. The expense of its residents, many of whom are. Pushed out of their homes and neighborhoods because of rising rents. One, which is already experiencing staggering housing inflation data recently presented by Cal. State Long Beach, shows that rents increased by 5% or more in and most Long Beach. Zip codes. This amounts to more than $100. In extra costs per month. With the city where roughly 60% of the city residents are. Amber, did your 90 seconds begin now? And BURNETT. Your time begins now. Good evening, councilmembers. My name is and Burdette. I am of faith who did organizer with Clue Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice. We strongly oppose the California Coastal Commission proposal that effectively removes 350 more housing units from Long Beach's rental and housing market. The Commission has a duty to protect access to the coast for all California's residents, including. Those living in Long. Beach. And that commitment is not served by expansion of the short term rental market. The question must be where is the attention of commission and of this council centered on tourists or on Long Beach families on providing what are effectively hotel accommodations in the case of unhosted rentals or on providing homes short term rentals. Remove housing for my residents while providing no lasting return for our city. You know, recently this council centered their attention and their votes on supporting the character of Long Beach by unanimously passing right to recall and retention. Ensuring that hotel workers can return to their livelihoods is laudable and forward thinking. But these same residents face the challenge of finding housing near their jobs. In fact, All Long Beach residents face the challenge of living in one of the least affordable cities in the country. So please do not vote to expand the short term rental cap, but rather focus on affordable housing for our Long Beach families. Thank you. Ailsa Chang, your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. Good evening, city council. My name is Ailsa Chang with Long Beach Forward. I mean, I can't agree more with the comments that have already been shared of those that are concerned and opposing the Coastal Commissioners recommendation. Frankly, it's actually quite confusing for the community because we understood that the Coastal Commission generally this was a contentious issue , particularly the 350 units above the 800 cap. And our understanding was that the Coastal Commission narrowly voted that down. So why it appears in the current staff report is very curious. But in any case, I ask you to consider city council. Who is the authority here on Long Beach? Short term rentals. Is it the city council or is it the Coastal Commission? Because the City Council ordinance already said 800 non primary resident short term rental cap, 800 unit cap. That was your decision and your authority yet. Now the Coastal Commission is coming in to say actually no 350 additional units in the coastal zone can be approved. So that means an additional that means a total of 1150. Are you going to let the coastal zone or the Coastal Commission bully the city council? I don't think you should. I think you should stick with what the city council originally passed, which is 800 non primary residents. Short term rentals. That is the cap. Garcia Lopez Reyes. Your 90 seconds begin now. Good evening, ma'am. Members of the council. My name is Chris Reyes, director of Leon Lambert Coalition for Good Jobs and Healthy Communities. We also have serious concerns about the post, the commission's modifications. Colombia Short term rental ordinance, Long Beach limits on hosted ACR to 800 throughout the city. The modification suggests expanding the cap to include an additional 350 UNHOSTED stores in the coastal zone. These proposed modifications could negatively impact renters and working families in Long Beach. This proposal would contribute to the ongoing housing prices that have even increased more during the pandemic. Instead of providing the needed solutions that we need around housing, we urge the Council not to allow these recommendations to weaken your own policy. And as a city council to protect housing by rejecting the Coastal Commission's modifications to the CAP on NCR and by also adopting an additional provision to limit ACR to the primary residence of hosts , as has been done in the city of Los Angeles. Thank you. Our next speaker is John Thompson. Your 90 seconds begin now. Yes, hello. My name is John Thompson. I'm the managing director of the West End here in Long Beach. And I will say that we also disagree with the staff report. We really applaud the recall and retention law that was passed. And we've worked very hard over the last three and four years to ensure that the ladies and gentlemen who work in the tourism industry have a place to come to work and a way to pay their bills. We absolutely urge that the Long Beach City Council today reject the Coastal Commission modifications and keep the number of stores designated at 800 regardless of where they are. Thank you. Our next speaker is Marianne Messina. Mariana Pina and I am a long term resident for over 20 years on the peninsula in District three. I am also a host for my duplex on the peninsula. I am a member and of the Peninsula Neighborhood Association and Alamitos B Garden Club very, very involved in my community here. I please accept the Coastal Commission recommendations that represents years of public input and successfully establishes standards for responsible operation of both home and sharing and vacation rentals. The Coastal Commission recommendations strengthen the ordinance and support affordable accommodations for visitors of coastal Long Beach. Now the recommendations help host with extra income in an expensive coastal region. Host are small neighborhood entrepreneurs who care about Long Beach and their communities. The ordinance introduces controls and limits to hold the host, the guest and the platform accountable. The caps and city registration requirements are in place. Provide lower coastal. Access without compromising neighborhood stability. The ordinance also protects neighborhoods and housing with percentage caps and multi-family developments, and by restricting to one plus one primary residence and one vacation rental per host owner. Please approve and implement the California. Or the Coastal Commission's recommendations. Thank you. Next speaker is Drake Stone. Your 90 seconds begin now. Over. Thanks for allowing me to speak. I don't have a formal speech prepared like some of the other folks. I am a short. Term rental operator. I live in. Long Beach and I live on the coast. I wholeheartedly. Agree with. This proposal. For the reasons actually some of the people have stated earlier. This is the Uber and Lyft of the hospitality industry. And just like those companies, what they have done is they have decentralized wealth out of corporate. Conglomerates. Into the hands of regular people. And now Uber and Lyft is a platform where the average citizen can go and make a. Living and provide for. Their family. So instead of tens of thousands of jobs, you've got hundreds of thousands of people able to support their families. I'm one of those people. I struggled my whole life with a college degree to provide for my family. And I've just. Been doing it now for three years. And now I am able. To live here in the. City. I don't have any units here, but I'm able to live in a way that I never could before. So people forget that stars. Are a business. And are jobs. They support local entrepreneurs. We hire local companies. We hire cleaners and and dry cleaners and security people and CPAs. And so I think it's a disingenuous to say that stars are going to take jobs away. That's only from the hotel conglomerates. There are other jobs that are supported and other local small businesses. Dean Young. Your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. Thank you for allowing me to speak. My name is Jean Young. I'm a 30 year resident. Of Bixby North, now District five. I would recommend that the City Council accept the Coastal Commission recommendations. Lisa Wise Consulting and. Urban planning outfit. Who was involved in the four years of public input and outreach. They said that 1200. Represented less than 1%, I think it was 0.68%. Of housing stock. And as another. Speaker mentioned. Most of these units. Wouldn't be rented anyway. They'd stay vacant because. Owners want to. Have their family there. They may live in two cities, may use them part time. On hotel workers. We pay previous hotel workers very well, perhaps double the minimum wage. People should check out turn over B and B if you want to earn extra income. This is just the new sharing paradigm and. The way things are working now. So the ordinance again represents years of public input. It establishes standards. There are requirements. In place for. Our last speaker of the night, Jennifer Walton. Your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. Thanks for allowing me to speak. I would like to applaud the Coastal Commission's careful research and recommendations. I support these recommendations. I have a right to operate a business within my home. Flat out I have a business license. My staff is registered. I'm a conscientious host for nearly seven years now and a host of families from all over the world who would not come to Long Beach if stars were not offered. My rental is not a party house or a luxury tourist rental. I use my home throughout the year together as my own family. My ACR is not taking any homes off the market. If a hotel worker is looking for my work, they should reach out to the ACR owners and present their resumes. I pay $25 an hour. We're not taking work from anyone. My ACR is one of hundreds not located in the hotel areas downtown, so it doesn't take away any hotel bookings. My ACR brings families to Long Beach who may not be able to afford to come here. Otherwise, these families spend money on the local businesses and flood the city with new tax revenue. In addition, I pay the 30% transient occupancy tax and income tax. This revenue stream is vital for our great city. And other than that, I just want to say I love hosting. I bring business too, to the great city. I've been living here for about 30 years. I love it. I know the city well and I have repeat customers who come from all over the world. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's my. Own business. I am an entrepreneur and nobody will take this from us. We really appreciate all of your support and we work hard to bring wonderful people to our city, and we truly appreciate all the careful research that you have done. That concludes public comment. Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate all the public comment of take it back behind the wheel to the maker of emotion here as Councilmember Price. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you to the staff for your presentation and thank you to all of the speakers. I think the comments were extremely important on the concept that I think we can all agree with here. I don't think there's anybody on the city council who wants to increase the cap. So I want to talk a little bit about that with staff. I was going to make a motion to approve tonight, but with the following amendments. Sorry about that. My boys are home and my dogs are excited. The the the motion that I would like to make tonight and I know the staff touched upon it, but it didn't have enough specificity for me. But I would like city staff to come back and I'm going to ask a couple of questions, but I would like to direct city staff to come back to council when we have hit 700 registrations. To provide an update to Camp Salt and give us an opportunity to modify our existing cap as it relates to areas outside of the coastal zone. Just staff acknowledge that amendment. Is that clear. A county member. This is Oscar worthy. That is clear. Just wanted to let you know that in the previous decision, the council had asked us to come back and provide annual monitoring, but we can adjust that to include the 700th as a threshold. Yes, because I don't want to get anywhere near that 800, because if if and I understand staff has one interpretation and the folks that spoke tonight have a different interpretation. Let me just make it abundantly clear, I have no interest in going above the 800 cap. We work really hard as a council to get to that 800 cap. We don't want it to be increased. And so if the number of the cap is getting above 800, when we count the coastal zone apportionment, then I want to make sure that the Council has an opportunity to go back and amend. So I just have a couple of questions if you have clarity on that. The question I have right now is how many? How many? First of all, let's talk about enforcement. To me, the number one issue is enforcement. I was just looking at some of the articles because L.A. was referenced. And while I understand the L.A. law was cited, it's very clear from all of the articles and the data that L.A. has been really saddled with a lot of illegal operations. A lot. That's been a problem, too, for many people. So I don't want us to be in that situation. And enforcement is key for me. And we've been waiting for this policy to pass so that we can have enforcement mechanisms in place to be able to ensure quality of life for residents. So can we talk a little bit about that? Absent a policy, what are what is our ability to enforce? I'm sorry. Go ahead. Councilmember Price. We are doing enforcement outside the coastal zone today. So we do that through our traditional tools with code enforcement, but with short term rentals because of the ordinance. We also have a vendor host compliance that allows us to identify problem rentals or unregistered rentals. And if they don't come into compliance, they are removed from the hosting platform such as the RPO and Airbnb, the highly effective tool. But unfortunately we don't have that tool in that coastal zone until this council acts. So our intention is to start taking registrations tomorrow. If the council acts this evening, and that would allow us over a six month period to ramp up the enforcement and to be able to hold operators accountable within the coastal zone the same way that we're currently holding them accountable outside the coastal zone. Okay. I appreciate that, because I would venture to guess that many of the short term rentals that are desired are in the coastal zone. Does that does the data support that? Yeah. So that relates to this whole discussion about the cap outside the coastal zone. You know, we've been taking registrations for quite a while and we only have 200 on hosted outside the coastal zone. So there is more than sufficient capacity to meet the 350 that's required in the coastal zone and to preserve the 800 cap. In fact, based on current economic conditions and current uptake, we're going to end up below the 800 cap. We're not going to be exceeding that. I understand that the language is opaque, but what's very clear to me is you the council doesn't want to exceed that 800 cap. And by managing how we take applications and we'll be able to share that and we'll report back to council. Okay. So right now we have this is this registration process city wide absent the coastal zone has been open for a while now and we have only 200 registered staffers, is that correct? We have 200 open hosted, which is what's capped. There are some others that are hosted, but that's where the the person lives on site. So that's a different category. But as to the ones that count towards the cap, we only have 200, meaning we have a capacity of 600 and we only need to accommodate 350 in the coastal zone. Okay. So if we got 350 UNHOSTED permits in the next six months, let's say, plus the 200 that we currently have, we would have 550. That's correct. Councilwoman, your time has expired. Okay. Thank you. I make you back up, although my colleagues may have some questions I'm going to support with that amendment. So think I'm making the motion with that amendment. Are the second on the most. I don't know if it's Second Amendment, but we have a Councilmember Urunga, and then we have Councilmember Sara chewed up. And then please step in this way. Thank you. Senior member El Fosters for conducting this meeting this evening. You know, when this first came to my attention, it was one of those concerns about the commission basically overstepping its authority by requiring the city to accept more. That's true. The bottom line is that I think it's the language that is causing this confusion of the staff report from the commission, because we worked hard as a council to get to this 800 cap. We were we debate it. We. We, we. Pushed back and forth in terms of what was a number that we could come up to that would be acceptable to us and to see. So when this commission and I sit at the coast commission so that is my my head at this is double I hit it twice is that I really felt that the commission staff basically added something in there in their requirements that were far above and beyond what we as a city council voted for. So I was basically ready and I'm still debating this as to whether we should just go ahead and and drop it, send it back to the commission, make the corrections, and then bring it back to the city. So the question would be, I guess, to staff at this point is that if we were to. So did not approve this motion tonight. Giving back to staff to get it back to the commission. And basically start over from square one. How long what would be the timeline or timeframe on doing that? A council member. You're on it. If the council doesn't act on the language that came from the commission and doesn't act on that by the second week of June, our ordinance will be basically null and void in the coastal zone. So we would have to prepare a new ordinance, obtain passage at city council, submit it to the Commission, to the Coastal Commission to go through their staff review, have it scheduled for a hearing at the Coastal Commission, hopefully obtain some consensus there. Then come back to City Council for it to be certified. So that process typically takes 18 months. I can not predict how long it would take in this circumstance. I would only share with the Council that even if we were to go down that road, there may be advantages to adopting what's in front of you tonight and asking staff to request revisions to an adopted policy rather than just throwing out what's in front of you. Because until we have something adopted, we're not able to enforce the rules within the coastal zone. Which leads us to my second point is that if we were to say we are not adopt this motion to make. And we're looking at another maybe knowing that the commission is understaffed right now. So they it'll probably be pushed back even further to two years before this came back to us. What's. Do we have anything in mind here in regards to the. Enforcement of stories. Is there anything in place that we can use in writing a book? Councilman. We still have nuisance tools, so we would be able to individually go after, I guess, the worst of the worst. Not because of there being short term rentals, but because of violations of other, uh, law. But in terms of the enforcement tools that are most effective, being able to remove the listing from the platform, being able to revoke their operating license, we would not have that tool available to us if if we were in the limbo period of not having the adopted certified ordinance. Okay. So. At the end of the day with this motion that we had here is that we basically have a problem with the wording that the commission has given us or that is willing to adopt in the sense that it sounds like with the 800 cap that we have and the cap that we have with that city wide and then the 350 that we have in the coastal zone, the danger is that we may overstep that 800, 800. So as to our cap, we have 1135. Would that would that be something that we were afraid of? I, I, I hear that that they expressed concern of, of many of the speakers. I also hear that it's very important to the Council to maintain that 800 caps. So from the staff standpoint, we administer the program. We have total control of the program outside the coastal zone. We would not exceed the 800 cap because we would manage the licensing of, uh, aspires outside the coastal zone to preserve that cap. So there is no danger based on the numbers of that occurring. But I understand that theoretical concern that if there was a rush of a lot of, uh, short term rentals outside the coastal zone , that it could create that situation. So I think that, that, you know, if we had an adopted ordinance, we could over time work on refining that language. But in order to do. The enforcement that really is necessary today in the coastal zone. And we really need to have something on the books to be working from. And Councilmember Brown got it's very clear from this council when we initially started this process, we had that we had recommended 70 up to over 1700 units CAP and the council discussed it, discussed the balance between housing and hospitality opportunities, and narrowed down that number to 800. And so we're very mindful of that. And as Christopher said, we administer the program and we are also required to come back to you, providing you with updates on that. So staff is very clear on the intent of the council and the language that the Coastal Commission also provided to us. Councilman, your time is up. Okay, I'll real. Thanks. Next up is council member. Thank you. Council member. Austin Acting Mayor. So I just wanted to clarify Councilmember Price's amendment. So I just wanted to clarify if you are voting to propose to move forward. But with the amendment that the threshold be it is that the amendment you're you're requesting so that we do have an enforcement of an ordinance in place, but that we keep it to somehow a cap at 700 or a threshold. Exactly. That that staff comes back to us, that 700, so that we know how close we are to the cap and then we can initiate a new policy change that might need to go back to Coastal at that point if we're getting that close. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. I think as I do, I want to thank, you know, staffer as well as all the speakers for sharing their concern around this. And I just want to reiterate with what has been shared that while I wasn't here with the how hard fought raising and keeping the cap at 800, I do agree with the decision that was made to keeping it that and I do believe that we do need to have some kind of enforcement mechanism which will allow staff to be able to regulate STR. And I do think that making sure we come back, if we hit that 700 threshold so we can work on the existing language to make sure that we don't go over the 800 cap, which has been, I think for me, a really big concern. So so I supported it with moving it forward with that amendment that we do get a report back at 700 so that we can amend the language even though I didn't second, I don't know if that means that because I didn't hear. Council Member You're wrong a second. It's I don't know if I'm able to vote on the amendment, so if you can clarify that. For Porter. Clarification for me, I was going to second, but I wanted to discuss it first. And I think that your amendment for 700 come back. I think it's a good one. And I checked that. So you do. Second, it would be clear. Yes. What I have for the comments that I have queued. Up next, we have both of councilmembers in Dallas. Thank you very much, Councilmember Armstead. I know this is that. This is. Crazy topic because we've worked so hard to get the 800 max. And I think it's very important that we have very, very clear language going forward, that that's where we want to remain. And, you know, so thank you just for clarifying all that. I think it's very important that we do remain that and that we do have that clarifying language in there. So one of the things that I just want to make sure for for everyone is that. What we're talking about is making sure that our cap remain at 800, including the 350 short term rentals that the Coastal Commission is requesting or recommending in that area. I'm you know, I like the fact that we are low in short term rentals right now, that we have plenty of room to include. So. Just one more time staff is that is that would I'm it is what I'm understanding. Correct. Yes, Councilmember, that is correct. Thank you. I just want to make sure that, you know, and maybe maybe what we do is make sure that that language is anything that we vote on tonight to make sure that it's very, very clear. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Next up, we have Councilmember Price again. Thank you. Councilman Austin, I just wanted to clarify a few things. So if staff comes back to us when we hit 700 and we're going to hit 700, if we assume that we get 350 in the coastal zone, that we have the 200 outside of the coastal zone that we currently have, plus an additional number to get us to 700. Assuming we get to that, 700 and staff comes back to us. Can council then vote to reduce the number of staffers outside of the coastal zone? Councilmember. Go ahead, Christopher. Yeah. So a councilmember at this council always retains the ability to change these regulations outside the coastal zone. So we certainly will come back at 700. I think we'll probably come back before then because we're also doing annual report backs. And I hear everyone's comments that the language is imperfect. It's much easier to refine the language with the Coastal Commission once we have something approved and in place, then then the from scratch process. So what will happen is, you know, depending on time and resources, some action is taken tonight. We would come back at the soonest point that different things happen. So in the unlikely event that we had 700 quickly where we'd be back in front of you in the more likely event we would be back in a year to provide you an update. And we would also have exchange notes with the Coastal Commission staff and perhaps be in front of you with language changes and make things more clear as we implement the program over time. And we could also make any adjustments outside the coastal zone that the council wanted to make. Okay. So just just for clarity, council can make a change. If we were to hit 700 real quickly and you brought it back to us, we could make a change. That change could include one. We change the cap for areas that are outside of the coastal zone to lower it. But we could also go back to coastal with language change or modification requests. It's just we can't do that if we don't have a policy in place. Right. That is that is correct. So if an action is taken tonight, starting tomorrow, you know, we can always make changes to this ordinance. But the starting point is being able to take some action this evening. Okay. So if I could just share with my colleagues why it's important to have something in place, step back. Since we adopted this has not been able to do really anything in the coastal zone. So if there are party houses, if there are we had a shooting at one store. If there are quality of life issues, there's very little that staff can do right now that's in that's consistent with what we all agreed would be reasonable limitations to put on stars, to get them off of the pro of the online profile. So we can't do that right now. Also, neighborhood opt out provisions not even available right now in the coastal zone. So a lot of what's available in the ordinance is not even available right now to the coastal zone and most of the stars in the city, probably over 80% of them are going to be in the coastal zone. So we just need to have some policy in place because it's a little bit of a wild west in the coastal zone right now with stars. So I'd ask staff to I'd ask my council colleagues to trust that staff will bring this back to us when we get close to that cap. And then we can reroute as a council and lower the cap or go back to council or even go back. I mean, coastal, we can even go back to Coastal before then to ask for the language change. As Council Councilman Ranga mentioned, once we adopt the policy, we can go back and ask them to amend the language to make it more clear in terms of what our intentions are. I believe that's what I heard staff say. So with that. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I'll just reiterate, I think the council reserves the right to change policy on any given Tuesday. Council member Urunga. And then we have Council member Alan. I think the customer analysis. I totally agree with the. Analysis that comes with a price brought forward. And that is exactly what I was going to say. What I when I ran out of time is the fact that this whole issue is brought before us here today, at least because Coastal Commission staff wrote a report that was. More confusing that we wanted to have. It does somewhat imply that our 800 s to our cap would be exceeded, and that is not what we would like to see. That's where I would like to see. Just to give you a brief history, I mean, Coastal Commission appointed. Appointed Commission doesn't always agree with staff reports that affect the commission staff. Sometimes they don't get it right and they don't get it exactly right, as the commission would like to see. So we've had in the past opportunities to connect with Commission staff, let them know that we disagree with their staff report and go back and do it again, or renegotiate or do whatever they need to do to ensure that whatever the commission passes is in line with what the commission wants. And that's where I'm at right now, is the fact that I would push that we would go ahead and and adopt this motion tonight with the caveat that staff is going to go back to the commission and have this language corrected or have it clarified that the 800 cap on this 2 hours will not be exceeded. I also accepted the the amendment that Councilmember Sato put forward that once we reach 700, if we start looking at. Amending our emotions in the city so that we can make sure that Iraq will be no no exceeding of the 800 cap or maybe even not exceeding the 50 that we are considering along the coastal zone where we're in good and safe ground right now. We're not even near close to reaching the 800, but of course, that could change. And as a city council, we have the right to amend our our our ordinances and our emotions. And that's where I'm at. So we have to make sure that the language is there, very clear that we are not going to be exceeding our 800 cap citywide and we're not going to be exceeding our cap on the coastal zone. So. I'm good to go now. Thank you. Thank you. So most of the made is seconded. We have council member Cindy Allen. Awesome. Thank you. I guess you call your acting acting mayor often. You're doing a great job. So I also want to say thank you to the staff for their hard work on this. And I know there was a lot of work from previous council before my time to get where you guys are at today. So I just want to recognize that. And also I did appreciate a council member your range really giving us, you know, his insight from the Coastal Commission perspective and also for his service on the commission. I think it really helps as we make these decisions. I think that regulating short term rentals throughout the city, including the coastal zone, you know, is important. And so we heard that tonight. I definitely want to make sure that we protect the character of our neighborhood. And also, of course, you know, the jobs at our hotels. I absolutely support, you know, limiting the number of hours on the coastal zone to 350. And I also like Councilwoman Soothing Price's recommendation for, you know, checking at 700. Absolutely. In favor of keeping that cap at 800. There's no need for us to oversaturate our coastal zone or or anywhere else. And then, like my other colleagues have said, you know, monitoring, tracking, tracking those regulations and help us determine the impact of those policies are, are and important. So again, I want to thank the staff for their hard work with them for all of their hard work with the Coastal Commission. Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you. I'll just add a few comments at this point. I want to just say I think this has been a very productive discussion. I think public comment was, you know, obviously we learned a lot from our public on both sides of this issue. I want to clarify that the motion is on the table is to approve with an amendment made by Councilmember Price to have a staff come back to the council. Once we reach 700, start usage kind of trigger to ensure that we don't go over the cap that. Which emotion was. That? That was my emotion. Thank you. Okay. Now, emotion was seconded by council member Urunga. I do think it's important for us to move something this evening because that enforcement in the coastal zone is, I think, extremely important. That's where the demand for stars are in our city. But I think we do need to be mindful of public comments on the importance of preserving our housing stock. I know the Council have been very committed just to our work over the last several years to enhance and increase our housing stock. And yes, we still have a long way to go in terms of building new housing in the city and in protecting housing stock. And so I think that's that's a that's a core here. And I think our cap, after many years of negotiations and haggling with all of the parties, the platforms we have, I think, settled on an account that makes sense for our city and a policy that makes sense for our city. And I think, again, I'll mention that we reserve the right, you know, three weeks from now, three months from now or a year from now, to come back and modify this policy to make it even better. That's that's part of policy making, improving upon what we we're we're doing here each and every Tuesday night. So with that, Madam Clerk, we've heard from the council, please, of roll call vote. District one. I'm district two. By. District three by district for. My. District five. High District six. I District seven. I. District eight. I. Motion is carried eight zero. It's scripted. So now I think we have to go to a general public comment. Clear.","Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by amending and restating Chapter 5.77, related to short-term rentals, read and adopted as read.  (Citywide)","Here are the key points I gathered from the Long Beach City Council hearing on the short-term rental ordinance:

Main Objectives:
- Adopt modifications proposed by the California Coastal Commission to allow the short-term rental ordinance to go into effect in the coastal zone
- Maintain the citywide cap of 800 non-hosted (entire home) short-term rentals 

Proposed Initiatives:
- Allow up to 350 non-hosted short-term rentals in the coastal zone, in addition to those allowed outside the coastal zone
- Require a coastal development permit to prohibit rentals in specific buildings or census tracts, based on certain findings
- Provide a periodic review process for rental restrictions in the coastal zone

Reasoning:
- Enforce reasonable regulations on short-term rentals in the coastal zone, which currently operates with minimal oversight
- Balance hosting opportunities with preserving neighborhood character and housing stock
- Comply with Coastal Commission mandate while maintaining city's intended 800 unit cap

Context: 
- Years of public input and negotiations went into developing the city's 800 unit cap 
- Coastal zones require Coastal Commission certification of short-term rental policies
- Debate around whether modifications actually increase the city's cap above 800 units
- Concerns raised about impacts on housing costs, displacement, and hotel worker jobs
- Trust in staff to manage registrations and return to council before hitting cap

The council voted 8-0 to approve the Coastal Commission modifications, with an amendment directing staff to report back once 700 registrations are reached, allowing the cap to be revisited before hitting 800 units citywide. This allows enforcement in the coastal zone while aiming to remain within the intended overall cap.",0.8700000000000001,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly by reasoning freely about the core message, flow of ideas, and underlying context first.

Okay. Yes, please. Director Agenda. VIP Records. Item 16 as report from Development Services. Recommendation to request city attorney to prepare an audience and resolution to designate the VIP record sign located at 1014 is Pacific Coast Highway as a historical landmark District six. Okay. Thank you. We do. We have a motion on the floor, but we're going to go and do a short staff report, I believe. So let me just turn this over to Mr. West. Thank you, Mayor Councilmembers. This is a fantastic night to declare a historic monument. Weren't turning this over to Christopher Koonce. Who will walk us through the item. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of the council. I know we have many folks waiting from the public, so I'm going to run through a couple of slides as quickly as possible. We're talking about VIP records, which is at the intersection of PCH and Martin Luther King. Here's another appeal. They're at King and PCH near the high school. So a little bit of background on the VIP records sign and its current location. Strip Mall was built in this location in 1962. The sign came quickly later and you'll hear more about that tonight in 63. During the 1970s, before we could take the mic and improve it. Rap really started, Mara, as an East Coast phenomenon. The IP records opened in 1979. You see the rise of hip hop and rap as a West Coast phenomenon during the 1980s. And you also see really challenging gang and other challenges in central Long Beach during the eighties and dissipating in the 1990s. So that brings us to today. In 2016, VIP records contemplated closure or relocation. In May of 2017, this council authorized funds for preservation and relocation of the VIP record sign assisting the business and side owner. With that, in June of 2017, VIP records filed for a landmark status for the iconic sign. And in November of this year, the York Cultural Heritage Commission recommended that this body make the VIP record sign into a local landmark. So the sign itself is of what we call the Googie style, which you see throughout sort of an earlier period, 1940s to 1960s, and we see it in a later example in the sign. So while it's a static sign, it evokes sort of a sense of movement and activity. It's a combination of metal and Plexiglas, and it's oriented in east west direction. Here's a picture of the sign. I think we all know it because not only of you driven by it, but it's an iconic piece of album. Album covers, music videos and our sort of shared cultural history and pop culture. It's just a different view of it. And the sign has remained. While colors are different, things have changed over time has remained basically the same. Not as many tapes sold in the later period. More cities. But it's a bad sign, as has been a fixture here in Long Beach throughout its history. So I think you really cannot think about VIP records without thinking about the history, about music here in Long Beach and about thinking about the man behind VIP records. And that, Mr. Calvin Anderson, is really a big part of why we are so enthusiastic to be recommending landmark status this evening. So at a time that it was is a difficult place to be for a lot of folks in central Long Beach, especially youth. Mr. Anderson was there for not only his family, but basically bringing in the entire community as a part of his family. And VIP records became really a refuge, not just somewhere to buy records and CDs, but somewhere where you could learn about music and the music industry. Somewhere where you had access to recording equipment, somewhere you could find someone to be your champion and to provide you some guidance. So when we look at historic landmarks, we look at different criteria under our ordinance. The first is that the sign is, in this case, associated with events that made a contribution to broad patterns of the city's history. So that's the development of rap and hip hop and a social movement that it recognizes. But I think the most important criteria that we're talking about tonight is criteria B, which is the association with lives of important persons and really recognizing the importance that Calvin held and holds to this day to the community. So this sign will be removed from its current location. So it can be properly restored, it will be stored, and then it will have a future life as part of a exhibition and asset to the community that I think you'll hear more about tonight. So with that, we are recommending that you declare the VIP record, sign a local city, historic landmark and direct staff to continue working with the VIP teams on preservation of the sign and promotion of it. So with that, if there's any questions for the staff table, I can answer them. And if not, we have a short video and I think we want to welcome Mr. Anderson first up to the microphone with his team. Great. So I know we do have a motion on the floor, but what we're going to do is Councilman Andrews has requested that we first do the public comment piece and Mr. Anderson wants to come first. So we'll do the video if there's any public comment, and then we'll go back to the council and we will hear from Mr. Andrews, the mic, the maker of the motion. Okay. So while folks come up, we do have a short video. So we're going to the video and then we're going to first hear from Mr. Anderson and the VIP team and then everyone else will get a chance to speak as well. Okay. Okay. I became a rapper. The VIP was like the place to go. If you know what war. Wherever you wanted to showcase your skills for people who was in the music industry. And the VIP was the closest to the music industry. Considering that Campbell was dealing with all of the artists that was making records and putting out their music. So it was a direct connect. And once I started making music, I got a relationship with Campbell and so many employees at the VIP, and they allow me and my cousin Daz and Warren G and L.C. Slice. We were able to come up here and work and make some, you know, quality music that was like mixtape material. And eventually the music was, you know, strong enough to get us a record deal. So the VIP has been special to me in so many different ways. That's why I shot my first video here. When I put my record out, I made sure that VIP was the first place that you can get the album. Long Beach in the title, my third book. First of all. I wanted to shoot a video in the city that I was from because we had never had a video in Long Beach. Second of all, I wanted to come to a location that was monumental and a location that was really the centerpiece of Long Beach. So by choosing a VIP and having a director like Fab Five, Freddy and Dr. Dre, it it magnified the abilities of what we could do with the video. And it became a classic video, The Look of the shadow with the sound of it, the whole delivery of the video. And I'm just glad to be a part of it. I'm glad I can say that I brought that to the VIP for them doing what they did for me, that was like a payback, you know, for giving me the opportunity to hit home my skills and to become a rapper for me when I make it to come back and make VIP, the hottest spot in hip hop. And to this day, the VIP is known as one spot that artists from all over and people from all over just want to come and take pictures of for the simple fact that it's a love and a love they giving me is a love. But I took it outside of the city. I took a long beach with me. Everywhere I went, I took the VIP with me everywhere I went, because there's certain things that I was told that I loved on the east side that were instilled in me that I take with me everywhere I go. So we're going to hear from VIP first through Henderson. Thank you, Mayor Garcia and city council members. I stand before you today to tell you why I think that the VIP record affair should become a historical landmark. I have with me today VIP with opened June 1978, and it actually was opened by my brother Khalid, a fan of and is here with me today. Cletus opened the store. He redesigned the Christmas liquor store sign and turned it into a VIP record signing. So I am honored to have the man, not only the man who put me in the record business in 1972, of whom I worked for for seven years. And he taught me everything that I need to know about the business. And like I say, for those who have those extra questions about how did the saying come about, I actually had a living witness with me here today, so I'm happy about that. Also with me, I have my children with me, three of them, Tasha, Tanisha and my son Calvin Junior, who, you know, grew up in VIP. My daughter Latasha actually ran VIP for many years. That allowed me to go out and network and actually build the business and build the brand. I also have my brother, Timmy Danson here, who actually worked at VIP and one of the early pioneers in working with young males in the community to teach them how to become a deejay and, you know, were the big help. So my entire family, it was a big supporter of VIP records. I also have a few guys that worked for me back for many years. Keith Thompson, Deejay for Life. Michael White, Deejay Forsyth, now Deejay P and I also have first degree here that when I actually opened their recording studio in the back was very instrumental in working with those young men's and women's back during the time that I opened the recording studio back to the site. I have traveled all across the country and to a few places overseas. And what's remarkable about that sign is that I can just ask people, you know, I tell them I'm from Long Beach. Can you name anything, any sites or locations in Long Beach? And it's always the Queen Mary and VIP records. And I had a testimonial about six months ago from a young man that came in a store and bought a t shirt he sees going to Africa for a business trip for a week. And he said, Well, I can't tell you what I wore on Monday. He's about to see. I wore my VIP shirt and he said he was greeted warmly. Everybody was very inviting. He said, with the You wore something else and nobody saw him. So he wore his VIP shirt the rest of the time. Recently in May, I was on a cruise, Alaska cruise, and the day that I wore the VIP shirt and several people on the cruise from France, Germany, Japan, the South, Mississippi, Alabama and stuff. And it's just amazing the reaction that you get from people when they see this logo. There's a logo. And, you know, I am very proud of all of the years, six months from 40 years and six months, it'll be 40 years. The VIP records have stood on that corner. And, you know, I'm very happy about the work that we did for so many years in the community. You know, people always associate VIP records with rap and hip hop, but I am very proud of the gospel years, the jazz years, the blues years, the R&B years and the effect that we had on all of those artists for so many years. I also want to recognize. Chill, chill. The gentleman here, he's up there. I know you want to speak, so I hope we can get a mic up there to him. He's a little disabled and and have a little hard time getting around. But, man, I mean, we are part of the family and, you know, we treat everybody the same. And we have love, respect for the. I think that's one of the reason that I have been able to survive in this community is because we've been able to get back the love that we have shown in this community. And, you know, there's no millionaires in my family because we give everything away. And so, you know, we are we are that type of family. And, you know, my kids were pretty upset about it growing up, but I found out that they got the same problem . And so I've given, you know, everything away. So I hope today that you feel the importance of making this sign a historical landmark that I feel. And because in many people's heart it's already a historical landmark and stuff. So hopefully tonight we can make it official. I have received it with something and I'm almost stop. When I originally moved out of the original location, we had a lot of you know, it was on the news, it was on social media. And I had two people to come from Japan, one from France and one from Germany that said that they could not die before on foot in VIP records because it had that much influence and impact on their life. And so, you know, the sign is very important to a lot of people. You know, I was told that it's like 200 and something historical landmarks in Long Beach area, and I know that, but I don't know how many is known in this many places. This brand is known. So I hope that, like I say, everyone feels the same way I do in this past. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Lemmy, we're going to hear from the VP team first. So we're going to hear from the VIP folks who are here. Thank you. Good afternoon. To the mayor. The city of Long Beach and in Long Beach City Council. My name is Cletus Anderson. In 1967 Hours, an aircraft painter alone beat at Douglas Aircraft. Douglas Aircraft. I became the BRP painter of the Year in 1967. I also opened the first BRP. I named it the Pier, a very important place. KPFA Radio was the number one urban radio station at that time. They had a list called VIP Top 40. They always repeated BRP Top 40 number one records as being known as BRP. We reap the benefit sometime we could sell 100 copies of one single tile in a day. So BRP would hear we. We couldn't keep enough amateur in stock based on the fact they had that BRP survey sheet that they were mentioned. And we had that name. So I said, We'll go to the roof. And along came Snoop Dogg. And he'll leap up on the roof. The BRP and Long Beach. And he made a video. That video went worldwide. Things changed that BRP. BRP became the world famous BRP. And he stole my thunder. But when I travel the world, I ask people, Have they heard of BRP? And they will say yes. The world famous BRP landed Snoop Dogg. I see. You got it. So I visualize one day being at L.A.X. and. Seeing busses lined up world famous. BRP tours. Long Beach, California. That smells. That sales revenue. When I hear the word Long Beach, California, I think of Queen Mary. The Pike and the world famous VIP. Thank you for my time. Okay, I know we have some folks who want to speak, but is there anyone else from the VIP group that has a public comment at this time? Before we open it up to general public comment. Yes, please come forward. Yeah. Hi. I'm not going to keep long. First, I would like to say that I've been knowing I believe in Carnival for over 20 years, for sure. I know. And I can speak to his integrity, his character. I have never known him to be affiliated or looked at him as being a part of the rise of the gang movement in Long Beach. He is a very humble spirit. He's a very soft spoken individual. Is a man. Can I get a name in? I know somebody knows him. And so I did not identify with that being placed in your writing. I may maybe you have identified it, but I didn't when I thought about VIP records. And also Calvin, I don't know if somebody was killed in front of the building and that I really don't know you. But anyway, that just struck me. I'm very excited about this moment. I have to share with you that I spent the day with Snoop Dogg on last week, Tuesday, and even though he cannot be here, he is truly in spirit here with you all. He wants everybody to know he loves him some long beach. And just like he said, he attributes it to his success in many, many, many ways and looking forward to the day that that bonds can grow again. I'm grateful for the opportunity to stand here and just see this moment happen, period. And I would like to say that you all should address the possibility of a monument being set up with the signs somewhere in the city of Long Beach. I don't know if would be King Park, six district area. Somewhere on that side, there's a park right down the street, I believe, on Martin Luther King Boulevard that is right behind that, the high school there. And I think a monument of some sort to the legacy of this space and this sign would be a wonderful thing. I love you. You know I love you. Be bless. You. Thank you. Mayor Garcia City Council residents who are here tonight. I have been given a privilege to come up and speak by the VIP team who asked that I come and say a few words. My name is Katie Rispoli. Tommy. I'm the executive director of We Are Even a nonprofit based here in Long Beach. Our goal as an organization is to help young people understand the city that they live in and build a relationship with it. We were privileged to recognize Mr. Anderson for his many years of service to the community and for his work being a leader to youth in Long Beach over the last 40 years. Recently with our organization, I, as someone who holds a master's degree in historic preservation, recognize how valuable it is that we do this tonight. It's no secret that this country has carefully created a collection of historic sites that tell a specific version of our nation's history. And as a result, we've denied recognizing the full American story. Nationally, we have begun to broaden that conversation by even more. In the city of Long Beach. Right now, there are only two historic landmarks designated for their affiliation with a nonwhite non-male individual out of over 100. So it's time that we start to make this change. And tonight, I expect you'll move forward in designating number three. I hope you'll look around tonight and recognize the crowd that's in this room. I know, and I'm sure you know that people invest in the government that invests in them. Tonight you're investing in them. And as a result, this crowd is here. Some of them for the very first time. Don't let this be the last time we are in these chambers together. Tonight, designate VIP records a historic landmark and let this be the gateway to recognizing all history in Long Beach and acknowledging, respecting and celebrating our city's full population. Thank you. Thank you. Excellent. Thank you so much. Best. Please come forward. And actually, we're going to lower that just for you just a little bit. Okay. I want to order for you there. So high tech. Technology. You got it. Okay. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And ladies and gentlemen of the council. My name is to me and I. I'm here to ask for your support to make the world famous VIP record sign a historical landmark for the city of Long Beach. I am eight years old, and in my short years, I have been able to see the impact that VIP records has had on the lives of many people. But I would like to speak on behalf of the children, children past and present, that have been able to see and use VIP as a safe haven, a support system , and a place to be encouraged. But to do their best, to be there best. For me, VIP represents family, and that sign that is recognized worldwide represents possibility to youth who hear the stories of how dreams were made possible in the doors of VIP, the place where creativity has been encouraged, where people are looked at for what they can be. This moment is important for my family, and I plan to make sure the legacy of VIP continues for generations to come. Thank you for allowing me to speak to you. And on and on. On a personal note to my papa, I am so happy to share this moment with you and other family members present . And it is amazing to hear how you have personally touched the lives of so many people in the city of Long Beach. We we, your family, are proud of you and love you. Thank you for your support. Very nice. Very nice. Thank you so much. And when we will move the speaker's platform up for the next speaker. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Vice Mayor. And ladies and gentlemen of the Council, I just am so overwhelmed with emotion today. I am grateful just to be able to experience this opportunity. I am here in support of you making the world famous VIP record sign a historical landmark here in the city of Long Beach, not just for its significance to hip hop, but to its significance to the community of Long Beach and to the people that I speak to personally, not in the community and worldwide. But see, that sign is home. See it as familiarity, see it as just a place to be, the place to be. When growing up, I grew up, as my father stated in V.I.P. All of us, my siblings and my cousins who are also here present. We are VIP kids because as you can see, and since 67, most of my cousins, most of us were born, all of us were born after 67, I think. And we have just been going through this process with my family. And it has been, like my father said, a amazing journey to experience the lives, being able to experience the lives of other people, letting us being able to be an impact to other people and going broke for other people. We do it not for accolades, but we do it for from the kindness of our heart. It is something that is embedded in us, all of us, as a family. And I'm just grateful again just to be able to have a father who has been instrumental in helping people achieve their dreams and instrumental in supporting people to be all that they can be. And again, I thank you. I am extremely humbled and thankful to be able to go through this experience. And I ask for you, encourage you to please make this a historical landmark. Thank you. Thank you. Next week at place. Hello. Love you guys. Appreciate the moment. My name is Freddie Johnson. I grew up in Long Beach. Okay. VIP has been open all my life and has been open to me and my friends all my life. And I've seen at least three of you guys on this panel at that place. You understand what I'm saying? There's only there's only really three things. In Long Beach, the Queen Mary also does pros, goes gay and is the VIP and is hip hop. Now, hip hop is something that is see or you got your own personal opinions about it. But one thing hip hop did do was make sure this city was well known. No matter what, Ali, or what corner you can go into. They know about Long Beach rehab. I've been everywhere around the world in this VIP shirt. And they respect it and they honor it. Because we upheld a love and understanding there of the city, of the culture of love in this city. And his brother behind me, Shani Domino. Okay. We took that place and we walked up to that place. No matter what we was going through or what we understood, we were accepted there and we were able to grow there and we learned things there that we couldn't learn at home. So it was a place for fatherless child to find a father. It was a place for a child can play safely in every way they can free think and they can learn. But what I'm asking guys is this What is history? A lot of you guys. A successful ministry. Look where you are. But that place is history to me because when people would not allow me. To express myself. That place did that, Mandy. When I needed some money to catch the bus to go try to to audition how many auditions we went to. So I had no money. But Calvin say he got $50 for you. Take this VIP shirt and you don't in number 60 and make sure you get out there and make it happen because we frontline is year. But what I'm asking you all to do is to give us something back. It might be small to you. It might not be too much importanti. But that sign means a whole lot to a whole lot of people. You know why? Because it was something to look up to. I go to Kings Park. I got the King statue, but I'd rather the man instead of a statue. But what we do have, I would rather have that and keep that because it is a part of my growing history. Every day I grew up on this side of Long Beach. That place was open to me and that place was there for me and my friends and I met my friends that could sing and rap because we are the original place of singing in rapid. Period. Long Beach is an R&B town. So what I'm asking you to do in your heart, what you know, what to do, because when you put this t shirt on. I know. Oh, yes. This is fly. Thank you very much. And there are available. But what I want to tell you is this. I want to smile with you. I want to laugh with you. But this place was a place that frowned with me to. So when I lost my father and when I lost my friends, that place gave me want. That place gave me a sanctuary. A place to go and learn how to pray. When the church wasn't open. Period. That's what I'm that's what I'm trying to get you all to understand the power and the value of this hip hop thing. Because the same people you look at, the Snoop Dogg's, the Domino's perfection, the twins, all of these guys excelled from the condition. They became celebrities from the same condition. That people make point at and say why? Well, here's why. Because it was a place to find change. So how many people will open the door to change instead of stand there and watch it die? I'm not pointing you out, but you'll know which ones I do know. And I don't know you. But I do know you because you run my community. You are responsible for the way that I grow here. So I'm asking you on behalf of hip hop, because this is my favorite hip hop. When I didn't have nowhere to go. When I was out trying to pull me to go to war, Calvin opened the door and gave me a cheer and let me plug that speaker up. And I stood and sat on the speaker until I figured out what I was going to do. So I'm asking you to please come sit on the speaker with me so he could give you an opportunity and show you a road to where we can go. Because as being. A young black man in Long Beach, I had many places to go. I have no where to go now. I have no place to go and celebrate my culture, which is hip hop. The hip hop and the culture that I'm talking about is not Hispanic, black, white, Jewish, Muslim. It is for people. And that's the problem that we have in this city, because I do understand, no matter what color you are, you are still people. And it takes people to put you where you at. So help these people keep the little bit we got out here so we can build some money. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker. So I, I obviously I obviously let the gentleman go beyond the time because I thought you had a lot to say. So I want to make sure you. Sure thing. But I want to make sure, obviously, just to to be you know, I've got to keep the rules going. So please, if can stay within the time allotted and we'll continue. Yes, sir. Hello. Thank you. City Council. When I was Vincent Martinez, I'm from Long Beach, California. I'm going to try to make a quick I'm actually on my lunch break, but I'm a music producer. I'm from the east side of Long Beach. I'm actually signed to a record label called Soul Election, which has has over a million followers worldwide. And a radio show on Beats one Apple Music. The reason I'm here is because I don't think any of that would have been possible without the app, because I had a lot of friends. I could have been a gang member. I could have done a lot of different things. But instead I just go to the skate park and I go to VIP records and learn about music, not just hip hop or jazz. So everything and none of that would have been possible without VIP. So I just want to say thank you, VIP. Thank you, guys, for your consideration for making this a landmark. And I hope you guys say yes and. Yeah. This VIP record is, is honestly, I feel like I'm one of the youngest people speaking right now besides the Kilo girl that I feel that it's a it's a symbol of hope that you can make it out of here. So that's why I'm here. Just wanted to on behalf of the younger artists, because hip hop now is not just about gangster rap. There's a huge community of Long Beach. Of artists that are doing soul music, hip hop, just different things, speaking on a lot of issues in our community, and that's why I'm here, just to represent our younger community and let you guys know that I'm a product of what we did and that we can make it out of here and it's not. So that's kind of nervous. But yeah, I just want to say thank you, Gabby, and thank you guys. Doing great. Thank you very much. Mr. Pete, why don't you come up? But, yes, Mr. Pete, your next. Mr. Pete, I need you to. I need you to speak. Please. Hey, Mr. Pitt, you're up. Look. I. I know I've been waiting for you to come up. Go ahead, sir. Come on. Couple of seconds. Give an honor to Jesus. He's the only one who deserves honor to me. But anyway, at any rate, this is a great thing. You know, it's it's long overdue because I've been there been a landmark election, but I'm glad to see. And here today, you really honor something that black folks did because black folks put Long Beach on the map, as far as I'm concerned. So. I mean, that's that's real. I mean, I'm not coming off racist. I hear everybody that comes in here. I mean, they praise they praise their race. And it's good. Everybody's supposed to. If you're white, you're supposed to be glad for which are people dead. If you're Hispanic, be glad for what your people did. But, you know, it seems like when you say something about some black, oh, why don't you guys. You know, this is good. And we need to have more of this here. Unlike, you know, I've seen in the past, which given everybody else. So let's keep it American for Americans and let's let's do much more of this recognizing what's here and let's include real citizens and not non citizens, because I know this arc has a has a thing with non-citizens. And the bad thing to me about this is I've never this is beautiful seeing all these black folks out here. I wish we get them all the time. But with the. Way things are going with a rent control, you ain't gonna be here that long because rent control is about to drive them out. And that has something to do with this, too, because we're finally recognizing something that should have been recognized. But through, you know, all these other bills, I see non-English speakers being pushed. I want to see more things pushed for black folks. I know you don't like to look me in the eye, Mayor, but you sure do push Hispanic stuff because you're. Not wearing your Trump hat. That's why. Well, you know what? Doesn't matter. Oh, you trying to get funny, huh? Well, check this out. You usually you don't try to talk about time because, you know, nah. You don't try to make yourself. Seem like a good guy, because I don't think you're a good. Guy. And you guys better understand this guy is not for, you know, so so you come up here more often, we're going to get rid of that rent control because that's going to drive black folks out. We're going to do much more of this. Rent control is bad. I'm telling all you, black folks see what happened in Frisco, New York and Santa monica. There was blacks in Santa monica before they put back control. So they want to put rent control here. So I just had to say that. So you hear that? Remember, no rent control. They're trying to drive us out. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Like. You go the next speaker. Okay. Hello. I'm the artist known as Domino, responsible for moving millions and millions of records, as well as being in many movies that have grossed quite a few millions of dollars. I just want to say that I have a lot of respect for VIP. When I was younger, they probably was the only corporation that was really identifying and connecting with the community, as far as I'm concerned. And, you know, a lot of us really we took this thing around the world because it meant a lot to us. It's responsible for many other artists that have moved many millions of records. I just don't know any other place or any other establishment in Long Beach that is responsible for such. And so I think that it is mandatory that we make something that has never been duplicated, a historical landmark. And I'm going to leave it at that, because everybody has already said what needs to be said. Sorry, that landmark in my head. So thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please compose. Good evening. My name is Pastor Q. I live here in the city of Long Beach. It's interesting that VIP is on MLK and PCH. Dr. King said this Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love. And when I think about VIP. I think about that. Soul right there generated by love. Why? Because in 1989, I walked into VIP, fresh from Texas with a group called The College Boys. And if you want to know who the college boys is, Ramani Malco, who starred in Think Like a Man. Two and Think Like a Man. And was in 40 year Old Virgin and starred in Weaves. So Kevin didn't just launch hip hop careers. He launched careers. Can I get a man up in here? And so to me, to me, I don't see you voting any other way. I mean, it's it's done. As far as I'm concerned. It's done. It should have been done. And Kevin, we went on. We walked in, like I said, in 89, we walked into VIP. One year later, we came to California to get a record deal. One year later, we had a record deal. Why did we have a record deal? He took money out of his own pocket, did a demo tape for us. We signed the Virgin record the next year. So. He has done so much for Long Beach. It's time for Long Beach to do for VIP. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. This is so obvious. But thank you for hearing us out. My name is Cammy Johnson again. And I'm speaking. And I hopefully this is the last time I have to speak about the historical landmark designation. I really like to talk to the youth tonight and our future, because what we're doing today is for our future. We'll be here. Everyone who is standing here, there's going to be five and six year olds is going to look at this video tonight and they're going to say they fought for us. This historical landmark designation is just one step into a step that I hope that all of the council members, all of this city can stand behind because we have more to do. We have a museum to build. We have trucks to go out to share with the entire nation about black history and black music. We have so many things that needs to be done, and this is just one step to offer leverage into those things. VIP means more to me than anything, and here's why. When I first came to Long Beach, I was five years old. And the one thing that I knew when my dad used to take us over the VIP records to pick up his gospel albums, because that's all we could listen to. And then we also went to P&G to get Boudin and all of the Cajun food that we weren't able to get because he's from Louisiana. We were able to see black business at its heart and inspired me to not only be a hard worker, to get my education, to make sure that I don't only work for somebody , but I work for myself. This is what VIP did for me at five years old, and I continue every single day to work hard for this. This is not something that just came overnight. This is something that has been inbred in me the moment I stepped my foot onto that pavement. When I saw those record signs, I said I wanted to be a painter just like that. I wanted to do record covers just like that. And guess what? I became a graphic designer because of that. It took me ten years to get my bachelor's degree in graphic design. I worked hard. I was a single mom, and I was able to cross that line because I always had it in me to say that I am an example. And VIP was my example always. Thank you, Kelvin Anderson. Thank you to Shirin. So the goal. You have you two have been really supportive of this movement and all I'm going to say one more time tonight to the youth. Hashtag support, V.I.P. Hashtag Dee Andrews Support VIP. Thanks so much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, everyone. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the City Council. My name is Sol Anika Smith and I am a longtime resident of Long Beach and a volunteer in Long Beach. And many, many of our programs and this is obviously a no brainer, in my opinion and in the opinion of so many people here tonight. But Calvin, I am here also to let you guys know. Calvin is so much more than just a businessman who has had a business in Long Beach. He is a communitarian. The IP records and that sign is symbolic with what the city has been able to showcase, and that is diversity that is elevating the brand of the city of Long Beach to when people do recognize that sign. And it is very synonymous with progress, with dreams being realized and made. And it is because of Calvin's dedication and commitment to our community, whether it's volunteering for a King parade and having that his location as a stop point where we can rest, we can get T-shirts , we can get some some snacks, and we can keep going. It is a it's been an epicenter of dreams, of goals being realized and also where people can create and we can continue to do that. And I just encourage you guys to designate this as a Long Beach historical landmark for so many reasons and to also so thank you to Calvin for being not only a wonderful person and businessman, but but communitarian in our community. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, please. Thank you, mayor. City councilman. I'm the youngest brother and he's the oldest. And via AP Records has been my life and the lives of most of the kids. We had over like 14 stores, so every kid and everybody that worked inside his store. Soon as he got out of school, I was brought to Bishop Long Beach a few months before Calvin took over the store. And it was a beautiful store back then and was still a beautiful store when he took over and ran the store. I think that everybody has a lot of things to say about the VIP. So in the past, I have vision for the future for VIP. I've been pushing also the museum idea. I see that New York is putting $40 million into hip hop music museum in New York. I say Long Beach is a place for right here. I hear earlier we are short money, short million dollars of all the programs. Then money need to come to Long Beach. I believe that VIP can bring that money. I look at things like the voice now that everybody's watching on television. VIP was a voice you want the VIP kids came there and we tell you, you have a hit record. You don't have one good many record companies. Often, every Thursday, actually, they invited us to the record company to pick out the next hit. The artist didn't pick the hit. We picked the hit. We told Best Buy what was hot. We told Target what was hot. Yes, we didn't get the credit for it. But VIP records was a foundation for hip hop and R&B and jazz and gospel and blues. So I think that talking about the past and I think you've already made your minds up about the historical and that's good. But I also believe that VIP can be the next Queen Mary for you. So I want to pass it on, but I thank you guys for my time. Thank you. Next week, a Bruce Springsteen. Good evening, Mayor and Council. My name is Bruce Milam, Jr. I moved to Long Beach, 1992 from Joliet, Illinois, and I wanted to come too. I moved out of there to get away from the violence and to come. To Long Beach. And then I got here with the naval shipyard. My brother was in the Navy and I you know, I missed the Navy here and I moved here and want to be in this being the entertainment business. And so my first very my first celebrity I even seen was that VIP wreckers, that Snoop Dogg video Shoot You Can is a little speck or you can see. Me in the video. It was a lot of people there, but but Fab Five, Freddy, Dr. Dre, it was really exciting to me to let me know that seen him there in the city, that I can do it too. And so from there, you know, I end up appearing on Emmy Awards and I released the album called Through the Eyes of the Real. In my first album, The Wrestler, we had friends, they call it VIP Records and Killed to let us put our album in the store. So from the video shoot, you know, years later, record music took in a record deal and ended up having our CD in his store. So I appreciate that. And, you know, now have a show called Downtown Bruce and and I'm on Franklin Middle School. Wilson Long Beach City College. Entrepreneur Long Beach. What aromatherapy business? I love Long Beach and with VIP records, it really helped me, you know, have, you know, take my dreams to the next level with knowing that I can do it. Seen all the celebrities being in the mix, as we call it. And so I would really recommend that you guys make this landmark happen. So, Kevin, I want to thank you for, you know, everybody in Long Beach for, you know, taking it to the next level. We appreciate that. And so this bill is real business. We have a lot of friends is a number of it's a lot of people that's not even here that went to VIP records and became so-called celebrities or got record deals. It's a number of them, the big list. So this is real. We want to thank you and I appreciate it. Once again, I'm Bruce Mahlum and I see you guys later. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good afternoon, Mayor. Good afternoon, counsel. And more importantly, good afternoon, Long Beach or good evening. Now my name is On the Fire, which I've been living in Long Beach for over a decade. And I'd like to first of say that VP Records is Long Beach. And, you know, I came to Long Beach in eighth grade coming from Orange County and, you know, coming into Long Beach. And I went to Will Rogers Middle School and I met a buddy of mine named Matthew Roe, who who came out to me. And I was a big dude. I was about £300 at the time. And he said, Damn you a big guy, man. Where are you going? High school. And I said, You know, I'm going to I'm going to Long Beach. Wilson And he said, All Hell no, hell no. You're going to you're coming to the phone calls. You come to Long Beach Poly and you go play football with us. So, you know, after that, I went up to my mom and dad and I said, mom and dad, you know, I'm not going to school unless you want me a Long Beach poly. And, you know, I went in there and I got I went in there. I was coached by Coach Slice right there. And, you know, I really embraced what, you know, the community of Long Beach was all about. I really embraced, you know, what that meant. And, you know, here I am, you know, a white boy from Orange County. And I'm surrounded by, you know, you know, blacks, Pacific Islanders. And, you know, I was kind of but but, you know, playing a sport and what's one thing that we we all related to was music. And I knew of coming along because I knew, you know, three things. I knew my parents had business in Long Beach. I knew the Long Beach Grand Prix because I love races and I know Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Nate Dogg and VIP records. And, you know, music brings community together. And when you look at, you know, what Snoop Dogg has done for for music, for hip hop and for, you know, just bringing cultures together and bringing community together, I think, reflects on what, you know, Kelvin and his family started here at VIP. And, you know, just bringing in community, bringing in, you know, things for good, you know, creating art. And I think that's that's truly is a you know, I think it's truly is a blessing that, you know, God has given us. Calvin and his family brought him to Long Beach. And, you know, you see the product of, you know, what has been created because of that. And, you know. I just I just want to say, you know, I, I worked with I got the real estate license I work with. My mom was a broker here in Long Beach. And, you know, we we were living in a property on Long Beach Boulevard. And my mom's like, here, you got to open up this property. We got some, you know, clients coming in. And, you know, we go in there, I open up the property and here comes, you know, Sharon and Kelvin. They come in and they're like, hey, you know, we're from VPI Records. I was like, Get out of here. I'm talking VP Records right now. It's just I, I couldn't believe it. And, you know, it's just. Just the warm hearted greeting I got from them and just just you. You could feel when you're around good people. And it was just I just can't say, you know, much more about, you know what, you know what Kelvin is and the VP records and that whole family is just they're truly are, you know, great people and you know, this deserves and I'm surprised it's not a landmark. You know, over 40 years everybody knows that sign from every every country in the world. You got to keep the time, so just keep it. Yeah, no worries. Always. I thank you for your time. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Next speaker, please. Good evening, council members and mayor. My name is Daryl Mosley and I'm here on behalf of Kelvin Anderson and the world famous VIP. And I'm praying that you guys support and vote to make it a historic historical landmark. My story is basically I grew up in Long Beach since I was eight, and I went to I graduated from Poly High and I lived in Signal Hill and I had to come down Martin Luther King to go to Poly High. I fell in love with music at a young age. And instead of hanging out and, you know, doing different things, I chose to follow music. And VIP was the place where I could do that, you know what I mean? And they welcomed me back in the day. We had like Warehouse in Lakewood and Tower Records and all that, and I couldn't hang out there for obvious reasons, but I could hang out at VIP though, and they would welcome me like a family member and made me feel welcome. And I thank you for that. Calvin. I feel this should be a historical landmark because of its significance to the world and what it does for Long Beach. I also worked at VIP for many years and I've seen a lot of people come from different countries and it's just amazing how respected, you know, that sign is in that record stories. You know, it kind of blew my mind to see people from Japan, from Australia, from all over the world, you know, I mean, they really recognized this sign. And like a lot of these brothers behind me, you know, I mean, my dream was to be a producer, a rapper. And he helped me, you know, have the ability to honed his skills. And I thank him for that. And there's a lot of people, I'm pretty sure that have that same feeling, you know what I mean? So I pray that you guys do the right thing and vote to possibly make it or not possibly, but make it a historical landmark because it's the right thing to do. And I thank you for your time. Thank you. We have three final speakers. I'm closing the speakers list so that. Oh, I'm sorry. So we have a clip, a few more. Okay. So I just wanna make sure I know how many have have. I can close the speakers list. I have the four that are in line and I have the gentleman that's in the back actually. Okay, it's going to be five in line. The gentleman, the back and then the speakers list is closed. Okay. It is now closed. I'm going to let the gentleman in the back go and then I'm going to have you come up next search. So please, sir. Hi. Hello. My name is Marcus Phillips. Better known as Chill. Singer, songwriter, producer out of. The Abbey Records. According to the AP, more than, well, probably 24 years ago as a member of the group 12 M, which was managed by Calvin and. I've seen personally being there VIP people that come in here and just from from all over the world. And just get so fascinated and just. So starstruck being there and may not even be a started to looking at but if you do you know, they look at you as being kind of a star at VIP. We see a lot about VIP records, the sign itself, because it is very important to the community. But Kelvin Anderson is very important to the community called The Good. Children did a lot for. The community and is still doing a lot for the community. If you need a job, he would give you a job even if even a just work day to sweep up or something. But he was always giving back. And this was not just to people in in Long Beach, but it really didn't matter where you came from. Anybody can come to Calvin and Calvin would help you with anything. I was always able to able to go to Calvin about anything, and he was always willing to help. When I was made up in that organization was the worst experience in my life. No, tell me 1/2. I think to make just one out that can. Yeah. There you go. You know, when I was up in the hospital after open heart surgery and I woke up and saw Calvin sitting there. And many. Times in that hospital. Campbell was there. Yeah. P t shirts and, you know, hats, whatever. I was at the Heritage Commission last month. Days after that, I had another heart attack. So I didn't know if I was going to be able to be here today. But I will call Calhoun once in a while and say, Hey, what's going on? And I plan on being there. So I'm I'm thankful to even be here today. God has blessed me to even. Just in case. There we go. Yep. So your guys blessed me to even see this day, but I'm more thankful to see all the people that have come out to support VIP. And there are many more that should have been here and probably could have been here. But they aren't for whatever reason. But. To me, I'm saying that this is going to be designated a landmark. And I wish we could designate a man as landmark. As Calvin would definitely. Get that. And I'm just pretty out there. Maybe kill Musharraf or cancel, you know? Thank you, sir. Bishop, in the last four speakers here. Yes, sir. All right. Hello, Mayor. And the rest of the council members. My name is Kelvin Anderson, Junior. I am the son of this man here. I've known him all my life. Uh, I'd like to pretty much make my long story short. It's pretty much as everybody has said, that, um, as far as what my father and what my uncles have done is they took a city and truthfully made a family out of it. I really don't see the record shop as a record shop. I literally see it as my home. And everybody that comes in is whether a brother or sister or uncle. And I refer to these people as such. I don't even refer to them as clients. So even with that being said to where I can see a man who sees a young man stealing from him and he disciplines him by taking his bike. And then the same very young man that came home, his skills to where he becomes a superstar today, that speaks volumes to where somebody just got out of jail for whatever they may have done, still brought him to the back, led him home, his due skills, and he became a legend today, honestly, one of the biggest stars known today. How would that have happened? I mean, to give them a chance. You ask yourself that. This man who everybody else kicked to the curb, he brought inside. Every last one of them, no matter how reckless they may have gotten. He saw the content of their character as far as what was underneath, as far as well as hidden behind any problem that they had. He was there for them. So with that being said, with what my father has done and what my uncle has done and how this may be a legacy and all that. Yes, that is true. And I'm only speaking on behalf of friends that I have in Japan that I would have never met in my life. Switzerland, Netherlands. Uganda. Who thinks to go there? To be honest. So with him having this entity and for people to treat this place like it's their own backyard, as if they've went to Michael Jordan's house or they went to Michael Jackson's house or anything like that. And I'm looking at this place like an everyday place, but they treat this place as if it is a church. If if everybody understands what I'm saying to them is sanctified to them, it's holy to them. It was their place of safety. They couldn't go home and do none of this. As a couple of others have said, my father became their father. That's why I look at them as my brothers or my peers. A lot of these people, I've cried with them, laugh with them. So this place is more than a business. So for this place to not already be an official legacy. I find that a problem. So for it to have took this long. Don't get me wrong, I'm very appreciative. But this should have been something that happened a long time ago. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Next speaker. Very good. You. I, too, was at that Heritage Commission and I hadn't heard I obviously had heard about the IP records, but had never heard the full saga. And it was extraordinarily impressive. You've heard it here today. My range of of African-American singers, artists is rather limited. Fats Domino was mine in terms of anything that it approached that in the other end of the scale. Marian Anderson, who I still think we should honor by having a facility down here. I would get into that at some other time. Well, and it was just so impressed by the the how culturally important it was to the people in the and within the black community and so forth. Functioning as a why? A sports operation or a parody organization. Well, one of the things I related to when somebody mentioned taking the 60 bus up to Hollywood reminds me a long time ago and in high school I had a boy band and in the summers we had a good summer in Maine. The neighbor, one of our neighbors, was a vice president of Capitol Records. So when I came out here, I did take the 60 bus and I forget what a bus is for the blue eye. What bus? Up to Capitol Records. And I went in, auditioned for it. He said, Come on back. I want you to meet somebody. Came back the next day and auditioned with him and Lew Wasserman. You know, it was crazy watching this one. They heard me sing. They sang me to a contract, the likes of which all they want is a lifetime contract. And the only other life going contract, which was a steel berg, had that lifetime contract as long as I was, as long as I promised never, ever, ever to sing. Because I figured if I sang, it would ruin the industry. Thank you. Next speaker, please. I think it. Was actually wonderful. Oh, no, I'm with that one. Wow. Yes, sir. A mayor, a city councilman. I'd like to thank everybody for coming out tonight, showing their support. I have no big, huge story. But I do want to say VIP has been a very, very, very special part of the community, of the city, of the history of not only Long Beach, but of California as well. It's a unique landmark. It's one of a kind. And I think we all know if we would do what's in our hearts to make it a historic landmark for the world, not just for the city, but for the whole world. And like we said, for the youth and an up and coming generation. I would like to give my votes for because without the VIP, I would have missed a lot of opportunities as well. You know, so we all have personal stories that we can tie to the VIP and. I just want to give my thanks for the brother, for standing there for so long through the ups and downs and not giving up and not giving given out and not turning his back on the community and for always helping and accepting us. And so with that, I truly thank you. And for those who don't have anything to give for Christmas, please come down to the shop. We got great items. We got good clothes, all sizes. Come get them for the Lord. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor Garcia. Councilman D'Angelo and the council. I just want to commend you guys for listening to the sixth District for PAP record. I commend you for that. I didn't see too many people on a cell phone in the council meeting as we were speaking, but I think you guys were hearing out VIP records. And I'm looking for for Councilman De Andrew and the mayor of Lowndes to continue to make this process, be a process and find a home for the sign of VIP records. I spoke with De Andrew earlier and he has our support to help VIP find a place for the amendment. And Councilman Garcia, I heard that you have been a very supportive in this and we as the sixth District will look forward to complete this process. And I thank you guys for hearing out all the different views that we had because we are different culture and people have different thoughts, but we all are one people and tell the innocent how, bring us all together. And I just want to thank the councilmen and the mayor and the Andrew for your support. And we're looking forward for your continued support. And by the way, I'm sorry, my name is Michael Baker. I own a barbershop next to Kelly Anderson. Mr. Baker Southcenter mayor, we met before. I don't know if you remember, but we really appreciate all the things that you have done for Sixth District. And may God continue to bless all of us. Thank you, sir. You know, the last bit askew. The mayor. I'm sorry. Have you got one quick thing that I want to say before Sherry speak, and that is the ACMA. 2015, I placed a sign up on eBay. I was burnt out. I was tired. I was alone. I'm like, you know, I can't go any further and stuff. So I actually took a stand off of eBay to look at some other possibilities and stuff, so I buy me a year. The idea of open a black music museum came to mind. So I'm like, okay, well, I need to sell design if I'm gonna try to open a museum. So near the end of the year, I'm like, Man, how do I get this done? Because in order for me to get this done, I need a relationship with the city of Long Beach. And he needed things, did you know, to help make this happen? Well, I would say around October, a friend of mine came back into my life that I hadn't seen in like 20 some years. And she said that she had been thinking about me. She'd been kind of reading things that was going on with me. So she came back and I sit down and I presented to her what I was trying to do or would like to do. And she said, Those things can happen. And I'm saying this, sorry, I love you. You really took this dream. And it's almost to make it a reality. I mean, I never couldn't have gotten this far without you. You're hard work, man. I don't know what else to say, but I had to get up here on record to make sure that I left. Not only. You guys, but everyone in here know how hard she have worked to make this dream a reality. So I had to say that. Good evening. I feel like I know you guys. I really do feel like your family. Even though we bump heads, we disagree on some things. Equity. It's important. And I don't want to talk about the past. I'm not here to convince you to make it a historic landmark. It's an important resource. And I know you're going to do the right thing. But what we want is for this moment not to be symbolic. We want this moment to be utilized to rebuild our communities. We want jobs. We want to bridge the gap in technology. We want to deal with mental health issues in our communities. We want to bring creativity in our communities. And we want to make sure that when there's a place down the street that's only a mile away, where there's only 3% poverty in kids and there's millions of dollars spent. We want our communities where there's 50% poverty in the sixth District among youth to be invested in the same way in historic landmark. I've had so many comments online. Why would the mayor throw away $80,000? Why would the city council do that? Help a private business? You didn't. You secured a historic landmark for the city of Long Beach that will bring your property values up in the area that it's in, 15 to 20%. You're securing a historic landmark that's going to bring millions of dollars in tourism into the city. And we're not looking for handouts, but we're looking for partnerships. And we're looking for the city to invest in what Calvin Anderson and Cletus Anderson laid down for us as a foundation. It's one that works. And so when we sit down and we meet and like, God bless you, vice Mayor, for the work you're doing with youth , because you have been showing up for everything we ask you for. Councilman Pierce, you are an amazing supporter. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart, Councilman Austin. You've been wonderful since we've opened up the small space in your community and you're very supportive. And and Mayor, you know, we have a we have something special. But I want us not to focus on. This the missteps of the past and limit our relationship for the future. It's really important for this sign not to be anchored as a monument thrown up somewhere that that's not what's going to happen. Guys, we have put together a plan to the city. We have put together a plan. And we have our eye on where that science should go. And that's on MLK and Pacific on that empty property where history was built. We should not have to bid. Right now, we're in a bidding process on this property. And I encourage the city attorney Pat or city manager Pat West and the city attorneys and the city council to work together to find how we can legally build our museum and multimedia center on that land. We should not have to run the race with everyone else. We should not have to be competing with developers outside of our city. When this man built that corner, it's not going to happen. But what I can tell you is that we're committed to help you raise the money, bring in the celebrity, bring in the investments, and rebuild the sixth District to reflect African American history where people can thrive again. This is it's not a sign. It's hope. It anchored hope when children had nowhere to go. It anchored hope. And that hope is not gone. And so what's really important, many have asked us. Right, Pops? How come you guys don't just take the sign and go downtown and open up a cool place and it's fun and you've got performances and music and all that is still. You're making it too complicated, they tell us. But if we abandon the community that built us. That's not what should happen. And so today is a beautiful day. But it's a bittersweet moment because 711 and the same week as this becomes a historic landmark, will be moving into the origin or opening up their celebration party this week to a Japanese corporation and a 40 year old African American historic spot. When this sign finds a home, it will become a point of interest. It's really important for us council members to understand the value that brings to the city. It would be the only one of its kind west of Mississippi. It would put it on the global maps and it will bring in investments and funds. We just want you to work with us the way you work with other communities. And so that Domino and all of the other artists and all of that can come back and invest their time in the facilities we build, in the multimedia centers we build. And so we want to thank you, and I really do appreciate you. But I'm an advocate and advocates are like doctors. You don't ever go to them when you're feeling well. Right. And so it gets a little bit uncomfortable sometimes when someone's fighting for equity, it gets a little bit uncomfortable. But we're here to work with you. Hand in glove equity has to be a plan and not something we fight for on a day to day basis. And so that's why it's important that the economic blueprints that we create of equality somehow have to work with the land use plan that has no equality, no equity clauses in it. We have to be smart in our planning right now, guys, before we get to 2040. I love our development and our growth, but if we have an amazing blueprint that says inclusion and then we have a plan that builds, that does not create a part for inclusion, we're going to continue to battle each other, and that's not where we want to be. So I appreciate you. I really thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I hope that we can create spaces in all your districts. Really, the opportunities that have been coming in are amazing. But I just ask you that when you look at VIP records, you look at something that is a benefit to the community, our resources, our growth, our kids and to help us invest. So I appreciate you. Thank you for honoring Pops, Calvin and Clearest Anderson and the Anderson family. And I hope we can continue to build from here. So thank you, Mayor. And to people, honestly, that have stuck with me, Chrysler, Batman has honestly held me through some really tough times. We have an incredible head of our economic development department, guys, that really believes in inclusion. He puts his money where his mouth is, his work, where his mouth is, and it makes us feel hopeful and a mark. Taylor, thank you so much. And Christopher Coons, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. So appreciate that. That concludes public comment. We're going to go now back to the council. There is in motion in a second on the floor to move forward with the designation. Councilman Andrews. Yes. Thank you, ma'am. First of all, before I get started here, you know that it seems like we we shouldn't even be talking about the VIP side. We should be talking about Kevin, because this young man here, his compassion and sympathy, what he's done for the sixth District and for the VIP. You guys here, I've been here, I think, longer than most of the individuals, 70 some years. And I've blacks have come and go. But I think Kevin's about the only black business that we still almost have opening now. There's a lot of things I think we can do. I think one of the biggest mistakes we made there is we didn't buy the building. We tried trying to deal with a lot. And I hear the young lady talk about across the street, you have to deal with that. I understand that. But there was a building already there. Kevin started there, and that's where Kevin should be. So there's some things that we should take under consideration. When I gave my $80,000, it wasn't because of the fact that I felt like I was just giving money away. I knew what it was for. And I hope that some of my other constituents up here will be saying great things about VIP. But sometimes I want you to put your money where your mouth is. So when we finish all of this, I'm hoping that Mr. Kevin and his family and the people here in the city of Long Beach. First time ever since I've been here for 11 years and that this many African-Americans come out and speak on any issue. So this kind of tells me something. When you get riled up about something, you will come out and you will speak about it. You will talk about it. And some of the speakers I heard tonight, if I had and that I would give all my money to you, Kevin, because when they finish, but it's just the idea that we have something that should be a historical monument. It shouldn't. That should be a no brainer. But then the thing about it, where are we going to put it? Put it where it started. I mean, these are some things that we really should take into consideration. And I want to thank everybody who came out tonight and showed their compassion and consideration, especially for a young man who started it. And Kevin, I don't think you want to leave it to him with it just up in the air somewhere. We don't put it off in a corner. It has to be more than that. And I'm praying that we can get behind that and raise enough money where we can, you know, really show the honor and privilege that this young that this sign means to all of us. And I'm sure Snoop right now is looking and doing his little rap song about it. We're going to get some of his money, too, but we've got to get this thing right. Thank you very much, everyone. Yes. Thank you, Councilman. Next up is Councilman Austin to be the second. All right. Thank you. And I appreciate those comments. Councilman Andrews, I want to thank Mr. Anderson for being a real pillar in our community. A father figure, a mentor, a black business leader, and inspiring so many in this great city and beyond. You are a real example of being your brother's keeper. And so we appreciate you very, very much. Thank you. And to the community. To all of the speakers. I don't think a whole lot needs to even be said behind Israel because you guys said it all. I appreciate and I share your passion for this design. This is an easy call for me as a council member. Who am I? What's my name? That video put Long Beach on the map in the hip hop genre, which is now international. It's a classic that made me snoop in VIP in Epic, Epic and worldwide. VIP serves as a community art space for so many youth over the years, and they work on there as they worked on their craft. And our city would be better off, I think, if we had more VIP records across the city. I would I would welcome one in my community. I was a young 20 something year old aircraft worker, Long Beach City College student, when I moved here to Long Beach. Many of my coworkers had roots in the east side of Long Beach. This east side of Long Beach. Not that. No, no. To my council members, I used to get I used to get all of my new releases, their mixtapes, VIP records. Usually after getting a fresh cut from Bobby Neill's, which preceded Mr. Baker will go to PPG Fish Market. Get my buying pies from Marcus. Yeah. Oh, and we ran many, many campaigns out of that shopping center. And Calvin was was part of many of the VIP, was always the anchor space in that shopping center. I think the sign is perfectly good where it's at right now. I always felt at home in every part of the city, but the sixth district is always going to have a special place in my heart. My wife, Daysha, who's upstairs? Hello. Jason and I and our sons have made many great memories in their community there. We continue to do so as Polly family as well as long as patriotism and our involvement in that. Tonight, we are here to honor and we honor you. Calvin Anderson is an entrepreneur and creating an era of pride for our city through your business efforts. This VIP record sign has been it is an iconic centerpoint in our community, and I'm heartened to know that tonight will be making it a historic landmark. I'll be strongly supporting the recommendation of the Cultural Heritage Committee Commission and voting in the affirmative. But also, you have my commitment to to work with you moving forward to make sure that we preserve the history that we built. Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilman. Vice Mayor Richardson, thank you so quickly. I just wanted to chime in and just say that, frankly, I'm just honored to be a part of the city council that gets to take this vote tonight and really reflect and represent what you are the community of articulate so well tonight. So I'm really honored to take that step. I do want to acknowledge that you've done a great job. So so Calvin Shaw ran the whole team, the community in articulating your stories. And that's what's required to make sure, like our shirts as equity, to make sure that we can make a case for why our communities are diverse , culturally diverse communities matter. I was astounded. You know, I mean, this this conversation has really elevated the broader conversation in our city around sort of the relevancy of our culture, heritage process and and whether or not we as a city of our historical landmarks, if if our cultural representation is really reflective of the diversity we're really proud of. And so you have really elevated that issue. You've done your part. Now it's on US policymakers to make sure we address the system that was put in place for why we have that lack of diversity. So it doesn't stop with this landmark process tonight. We have to make sure that we continue to acknowledge and demand that all communities, no matter your background, you have a significant history that's relevant and it's important and it needs to be recognized by our city. Finally, I just want to give a big shout out to the Andrew's the. I got to tell you, when sometimes it's difficult to articulate something that's important to you in your community, to others, and you've stepped up, put together the funding to make all of this possible. And so I do want to recognize you for doing that and say that I support I support your leadership. I support the community. I'm going to vote in support of this tonight. And I want to see. I want to see where this all lands. I want to make sure that we do keep the presence of Bishop Long Beach in central Long Beach, where it where it started. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor Council Member Pearce. Yes, I am also extremely honored to be on the council that gets to name this as a historical landmark. The first time this came to council, I shared a lot about my background and some of you guys probably heard I won't share it all again today. But you know, when Snoop said, I take Long Beach or I took Long Beach everywhere I went. Growing up in Houston, in the neighborhood I grew up in, hip hop and rap was a core part of of me. Even though the majority of the folks didn't look like me, I still grew up poor and grew up where those stories were relevant for me. And so coming along, this was the first place I drove by. The very first time we moved to California and we took our drive up PCH. We said, we got to stop and see. And I you know, Sharon has been an amazing advocate. And I think the comments that she makes, it gets uncomfortable when people fight for equity is so core to where we are on this council, to where we are in history right now, and how proud I am of you all fighting and demanding that equity and working with councilmembers like Councilmember de Andrews, who has always fought for equity. And sometimes we need community members as a partner to work with to be able to get there while we have a vision in our heart and we know where we want to go. We can't do it alone unless you guys are out there fighting with us. And you were here tonight. And so and I'm saying I agree this comment, this is the beginning of where we're going. This is the beginning of a partnership with the rest of the colleagues, with the mayor. And again, I do want to shout out to John, our economic development director. I've worked on him on a couple of items around equity and just he's always so great about having that conversation define what that word means for me. What does that look like? And process. We're growing as a city and we're growing as a city because you guys put your hearts out there and every single one of you, Calvin, you obviously are a mentor so much. And as my colleague said, My Brother's Keeper and I think about that lately I've been doing this thing where I'm like, how do I get my good karma, right? So it's like I'm paying other people's meters and everything and it's just having that warmth that you guys have. You feel like a family and you bring that in here and it feels so warm and so loving. And I just want to thank you for sharing your stories with us. I look forward to working together. I know you guys have your heart set on a place and whatever we can do, we will do that. And I've also talked about how do we go and bring other folks to this partnership? While you guys have put Long Beach on the map for music, we also have another other communities that have music. And so how do we do this together will be, say, all of us can celebrate our diversity and Long Beach together. You know, you've got indie artists that love hip hop and vice versa. We all take from everybody's art and craft. And so I'm really looking forward to what this means for the next steps for Long Beach. We'll just thank you all for putting yourself out there. Appreciate it. Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman Gonzales. Yes. I, too, want to say I hope everyone will support and I think we're getting there. Absolutely. And I want to say congratulations for all of the work that each of you have done, Calvin, Cletus, your whole family. Shereen Your words were just absolutely beautiful for a councilmember like myself who grew up in my younger years in North Long Beach and then going to Cal State and then becoming a council member. And I think when I was very first elected, I went into the store and talked to Calvin and just learned the history because that was the first thing is like when you become elected, you have to understand not what's going to be happening next, but where we've come from and what the history is. And I was so glad to have that chance to speak with you directly and just have a moment with you about a couple of t shirts about my records I had my first record player had to get them at VIP, but just like my council colleagues had mentioned, this is just the beginning. I know that the landmark is one thing, but the beginning means that I see you becoming really a fixture of mentor mentorship with a lot of entrepreneurs that are coming along that really want to know the history, not people that, you know, come in here and kind of fly by night and just go in and go out. But people that have been here and a mainstay for social responsibility and great entrepreneurship. So I absolutely see that for you. And I just want to say again, thank you. You have sold our city. A lot of times we go to other regions and we talk about the city of Long Beach and absolutely people bring up VIP. And it's a source of pride I know for myself. And it will continue to be so. Thank you so much again. I think you killed two women, Price. Thank you. I want to echo the comments of my colleagues. And I have to tell you guys. That those of you who spoke tonight, some of the most. Eloquent words I have ever heard being on this council and spoken with sincerity, authenticity and so much respect, respect for the person you see as a mentor. Respect for each other. Respect for us as a council. We don't always see that. And I have to tell you, it made me want to just stop and listen to everything you were saying, because it was just from a place of goodness and from a place of passion. But understanding. Your. Audience and understanding how important it is to convey your experience in such a positive way, it really, really was impactful for me, I think, to the Anderson Brothers. I learned a lot tonight from hearing from everyone speak. And I don't know if this is true. You guys have. To tell me if this is true or not. But I get the sense that, Calvin, that you're a very humble person. And that you help people. But it's not for you. It's not about getting credit. It's not about making sure that everyone knows. That you did something. It really is about. Is that right? Am I. Is that him? Yeah. It's about really making a difference. And it sounds like what he cares about most is not himself, not promoting himself. It's about every single one of you who got opportunities I love. I forgot your name, sir. What? The guy was trying to sell us the beautiful shirt right there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your words were really. Really beautiful in my in my day job. I'm a prosecutor, and I always look at folks who give people a second chance, give them a chance to learn the lessons and do the right thing. And people like Calvin are really hard to come by. I don't see them very often, and I respect that on such a deep level. So obviously that agenda item tonight, it's it's a no brainer. But to me, I feel like this was such an eye opening experience for me. I learned so much that I didn't know and I'm so. Grateful that there are people like you here. Frankly, I'd love to have people like you all around my community too. Because when we talk about struggles, every community has got some sort of struggle or stress or something that they need mentorship with to make sure that they make good choices. And I'm so grateful that you guys came here tonight. I really feel I was as I was listening to you talk and sharing, you said something about and I say sharing because I'm Persian and that's. How we say it. But you said something that I loved, which was, you know, we may butt heads, but we are family. And you consider that family? And I you know, I'm one of those people who really believes we have to respect one another in that situation. And so I you guys taught me a lot as you were talking, I was thinking to myself. I'm so glad. I like Vice Mayor Richardson was saying, I'm so glad I'm able to be a part of this. It really is one of those memorable moments because Councilman Andrews hit it right on the on the head. We don't have a lot of African-American speakers come to council to speak. And when and tonight to me. Said a. Lot to me about who you are, what you think about your community, the level of respect you have for the system. Thank you. Thank you for that. And Councilman Andrews, you are. You are Calvin Anderson. You know that, right? You're one of those people who does so much good for your community and you never are promoting. Yourself. Ever. He is. The man is just a class act. He does it. Because it's the right thing to do. He fights for jobs. He fights for opportunity. He fights for his. District, too, to move up and get. Advance. And he does it with so much class. To me, I look up to him as a mentor on this council and I thank you guys for honoring and respecting that because he deserved that tonight. So thanks for bringing asylum. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Mongo. When I entered the chambers tonight among you, I saw a mentor of mine. And so I got to sit in the crowd tonight with him and feel your passion and pride as each of you got in line to speak. And we kind of chatted about some of your stories and the things that are going on in each of your lives and the mission and vision that you've had for VIP records. And it's fine. And during your speaking, I came up with three words, and I think these are three words that a lot of people could learn a lot from your testimony here today. And that is. You came to the table with solutions. You always have. You come to the table with hope and you always offer sweat equity. It's not a donation of $80,000. It's an investment. And I appreciate that. In your discussions and dialog, you talked a lot about what the city's meant to you, and that's really identifiable, but also thanking those that have worked with you along the way. And so I'll also give some credit not only to our own Councilmember Dee Andrews, but our economic development team that works full time to make sure these things become a reality. And so for that, I, of course, am 100%. Yes. Thank you. Remember your anger. Thank you, Mayor. You know, I can't remember a day ever driving down PCH. And not seeing that site. That I can't remember that ever. It is a little bittersweet today because we're talking about a sign, but we're talking about a lot more than that when we talk about. The owner of the store and the meaning of Long Beach and the meaning that it has that it carries for central Long. Beach. I was a community college trustee at City College, and I go down a lot on my way to the PCC campus and I would always see it. And they'd always be some cooking out there. Some kind of barbecue going on and smoke. And it it brings back some fond memories. And my hope is that it stays on PCH somewhere, preferably there. That's going to be the struggle. That's going to be the challenge. But that would be my hope and my dream to keep it where it's at. And I would be 100% on this. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Super. Thank you. I, too, will be supporting this item tonight. And I'd like to thank everyone for being here tonight and speaking and in special thanks to the Andrews. I think the Andrews and I are probably the only ones are old enough to remember when the sign was originally erected and part of a kind of a mini urban renewal on the PCH quarter back in the day. And two things I'm very struck by. Number one, that anything in Long Beach has lasted that long. We're real good at tearing things down, but we need to preserve a lot of our historical items such as this. The second thing that struck me tonight was the statement that worldwide we're known for two things the VIP sign and the Queen Mary. Now, staff, as I recall, I think the city has spent upwards over $200 million on the Queen Mary. So when you look at it, I think the VIP sign might be the biggest PR bargain the city has ever had. Thank you very. Thank you. Thank you again. I think to to the power of of of the moment and the importance of the item. And we we really have everyone speak on an item, but everyone wanted to to give the remarks and some of that. I'm going to close. And before we vote, let me let me just say just, of course, to Mr. Anderson, but really to that just to the Anderson family. I know there's a lot of folks here, so thank you for your service to Long Beach. I've told you this before. I'll continue to say it tonight and whenever I can. I think that it's really important that tonight we we designate this an important historic landmark for the city. But it's really about honoring you and honoring your family. And I think that just want to make sure that we don't miss that as part of of the moment. Clearly, your devotion as a black business owner, as a family that brought so many people in during difficult times in our city's modern history, whether it was some of the photos that we saw, we remember what happened during the riots and during other difficult times in in Long Beach is history. But really, the region's history of VIP has been such an important part of that. I also want to say I, I always say this. I like to and it brings me back to my younger days. But I say the first the first record I ever bought with Doggystyle by Snoop Dogg. I listen to it nonstop. I can still recite probably almost every lyric from the album. I love hip hop, I love the history and VIP's, an important part of of that history. I also think it's really important and it's something that that Mr. Anderson said, which I think is really important and something that's been repeated a few times. It should not be lost on us that we have so few historical landmarks that honor, first and foremost, the black experience and black Americans in Long Beach, because regardless of of other communities, whether it's the Latino community or the LGBTQ community or others, the black history goes back extensively and has been a huge part of the development of Long Beach. And if you look at. Recent histories that have been written about Long Beach. And there are some there is absolutely a lack of coverage of the black experience and and what the African-American community contributed to the growth of the city from business creation, from the development of our school system, from the civil rights movement. There's so many black leaders that were involved in the civil rights movement. And so you're starting to see, particularly in the last few years, a recognition, long overdue of the contribution of black Americans in Long Beach. And you're seeing it finally in some of the naming of our schools in the what's happening tonight and in other ways , which I think are really important. And so I would just challenge us as a city. And I'm also speaking to the staff from Mr. West on down. I would challenge us as a city that we have to do a much better job of recognizing and honoring the black experience in Long Beach. And also just just to conclude, I'll say that I think we've you've heard loud and clear that this this council, every single one is very supportive of this. But also, I think you've heard that we're also very supportive of what VIP means and what's the next step, because we know today closes each a chapter on the restoration side. But we're very aware that there is much more to do and much more and other ways that we will recognize the Anderson legacy and the VIP legacy in Long Beach. And we're all I know I am and others are very interested in that. I do want to say first, Councilman Andrews, thank you so much for your leadership and support. You and I have had many conversations about this, and I just want to thank you for we wouldn't be here without your support. I want to thank Sharon. Listen, your you hustle and you did a great job of of inserting yourself sometimes in uncomfortable moments by inserting yourself to ensure that people listened and and took this process seriously. And I want to just personally thank you for that. I think I thank you for the friendship that we have built. But thank you for pushing the city, especially our staff team, to really understand how important culturally this is. Not just beyond just being a sign, this is a culturally important experience. And I want to thank you for that. And then lastly, just all the folks that are here. Thank you for coming out, speaking out. This is an important moment for all of you, for the black community, for hip hop, for VIP, for the Anderson family. And you have my commitment and I know you have the staff's commitment to really continue doing this kind of work. And again. Mr. Andrews, thank you. Yes. And in closing. Sure. Go ahead. Yes, in closing, I just want to say, I want to thank all of my people coming out tonight and really showing, you know, respect and dignity. But we really was very important. And even to be able to have Mr. Pay, you know, when you can keep him in line. You guys did a great job. I just want to let you know and thank you very much, every one of you coming out tonight. Again, thank you. Thank you. Let's go ahead and take a vote, please. I understand. Motion case. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Thank you. Okay. Thank you all. We're going to continue with the rest of the agenda. Thank you all for for coming out. I do have the consent calendar in front of us.",Recommendation to request City Attorney to prepare an ordinance and resolution to designate the VIP Records sign located at 1014 East Pacific Coast Highway as a Long Beach Historical Landmark. (District 6),"Here is a concise summary of the key points from the presentation:

- The Council unanimously voted to designate the iconic VIP Records sign located at 1014 Pacific Coast Highway as a historic landmark in Long Beach.

- VIP Records, opened in 1979 by Calvin Anderson, became an important cultural hub and safe haven, especially for the local hip-hop/rap music scene as it emerged in the 1980s. 

- The sign's distinct ""Googie"" architectural style and global recognition on album covers and music videos makes it an iconic symbol of Long Beach.

- Calvin Anderson and his family were praised for their mentorship of youth, providing a refuge, and supporting music careers over VIP's decades of operation in the community.

- There was strong public support to landmark the sign to honor its cultural significance, especially to the African-American community which lacks representation among Long Beach's historic landmarks.

- Future steps include finding a permanent public location to relocate and showcase the preserved sign, potentially as part of a multimedia museum celebrating VIP's legacy.

- The landmark designation starts a larger partnership to invest in the 6th District neighborhood where VIP was founded and uplift its African-American heritage through economic development.

The key takeaway was granting historic status officially recognizes VIP Records' iconic significance to Long Beach's cultural identity, music history and African-American community after decades of influential impact.",0.8454545454545457,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly by reasoning freely about the core message, flow of ideas, and underlying context first.

And we're putting up the presentation. Good evening, mayor council members. My name's Jennifer Ott, chief operating officer for alameda point here for our may status report on Alameda Point. And while I'm going to touch very briefly on some pretty pictures, the real focus tonight is on the hard numbers here and starting to really look at some of the financial and fiscal pieces of the project and get into some of the. Nitty gritty and technical parts of that. So that's what I'm going to focus on tonight. The. This. You know, I mean. Just. Okay. I'm just going to turn this slide. Sorry. Excellent. So the presentation over here, I'm going to quickly go over the May 11th Planning Board actions. You know what took place last week. Review the upcoming June 16th City Council meeting documents and process. There's a lot that's going to be on that agenda. We've been kind of piecemeal in it, too, over time. But I just want to be really clear about what's what the recommendation, where we're headed that night. And then I'm going to present a summary of the city financing plan and then present an approach to fiscal neutrality and the summary of the aluminum point inside our fiscal impact analysis. First May 11th Planning Board action. So the on May 11th, the planning board took three actions. The first was to approve the development plan. I should say those actions were all unanimous. They approved the development plan. That's been all the pretty pictures that you've been seeing over the last several months. This is obviously an image of that. I have that here on the computer. So if there are questions about that and what got ultimately approved, I can pull that up as part of the questions and we can walk through that. I'm not going to go over that tonight. I'm going to focus on the numbers piece. Unless you have questions about it. We also they also recommended city council approval of the development agreement, not the disposition development agreement, which is really all the nuts and bolts of all the obligations related to land payment and developer obligations . But it is the development agreement related to kind of the city's hat that it wears as part of the regulatory agency and in kind of vesting some of the rights that they have under the development plan. So that also got recommended to the City Council for approval and then they provided some final comments on the team compliance strategy. June 16th City Council. What's what's coming is that disposition development agreement that I just mentioned that itself will be agreement that the majority of the pages will be a very lengthy document that will walk through all the development obligations, the terms of price, in terms of payment, the term of the agreement. I'm going to actually walk through a couple of provisions with you tonight, just things that you haven't heard yet. And then attached to it is all of this, along with a bunch of exhibits that are pretty immediate themselves. Some of them you've seen, some of them haven't. The first is the TDM compliance strategy. You've seen different iterations of that, an affordable housing implementation plan, which really is the agreement and kind of plan for implementing the the city's inclusionary housing ordinance, the density bonus ordinance, as well as the provisions of the Renewed Hope Settlement Agreement. All of that will be in an exhibit attached to the Disposition Development Agreement, a milestone schedule that lays out and I'm going to get into this in a second, the major milestones, progress milestones, so we can keep track of performance over time, making sure that the developer is performing and doing the things that they said they're going to do a phasing plan which looks at the phasing of development that was attached to the development agreement. And so that was in your packet for tonight. The infrastructure package, consistent with the master infrastructure plan, consistent with RFQ that was issued from developers. That $88 million package of infrastructure. It outlines the phasing of the infrastructure. That, too, was attached to the development agreement. A part of your packet for tonight leases for two of the buildings. That building 117 118. There are two lease commercial buildings that ultimately will be part of a phase three conveyance to the developer for commercial development . But the developer and we can talk about this in a second if there are questions about this that wants to have leases, we actually use those buildings for jobs and investment and commercial development before they take title to that land. So these leases allow them to use those buildings on an interim basis that a master Tidelands trust lease for building one 3113 and two restaurant pad. So part of the site falls in the state tidelands trust areas which we own, but we cannot sell and we own it and we keep it in trust on behalf of the state of California. And so it's highly restricted about what kind of uses occur there. We can't sell it. And so this will be a lease because there are parts of the the waterfront that they want to use for restaurants and reuse one of our buildings. And so this lease contemplates the use of those properties within the Tidelands trust areas and then a subdivision improvement or public improvement agreement that talks about the infrastructure construction and making sure that they're performance bonds so that ultimately the infrastructure gets once it gets started, it it gets ultimately there's a performance bond to make sure that the infrastructure gets built and then a license agreement for phase zero activities. The development agreement, which was attached to your staff report tonight, and then the multifamily housing waiver, which is required under the town center plan to allow the type of housing and the product types that are required under the town center is that there's a waiver of the multifamily housing prohibition pursuant to the density bonus ordinance. And so they've requested that those letters have been attached to a couple of different staff reports. So all of this will be this whole package of documents we're working madly and not just me, your city attorney's office, all the different departments are getting pulled in on various aspects of this. So we're all working very hard to put all these documents together and come to you on June 16th with a recommendation, I should say. The developer as well. We're working very closely with them on all of this. So now to the numbers part of this. Actually, I'm sorry, before that, I wanted to just mention this because this is a part of the DDA that we wanted to make sure that you understood going before we come to you with the DDA, the INA specify that the overall term of the DDA or this development, this disposition development agreement was 20 years. So if it's executed this year, that's 2035. The project milestone, the schedule that the developer has put forward is actually a 15 year development schedule. We were very appreciative that the developer did not max out the full timelines of the 20 years. So they've actually been very aggressive about their milestones, schedules and their performance and we appreciate that. And so what that project Milestone Schedule says is that the Phase three completion of the project, which is the the final phase, is expected to be complete in 2030. There are potential extensions to this, which I'm going to get to in the next slide. But that puts phase one, essentially each phase at about five years. It's a little less than five years. The potential extensions to the milestones schedule are only allowed on major milestones. So closing on the transfer of the land. Completion of infrastructure completes completion of vertical. And then there's these progress milestones. So for instance, design review or commencing infrastructure, we they're in a schedule. We want to keep track of those things because that's early indicators of whether or not the performance is likely to occur or not. But they're not events of default. So if they don't meet those project milestones, that doesn't have the same consequences. What we really care about is, are you closing on the land or are you completing the infrastructure, you're completing the vertical. And so those are what we have defined as major milestones, potential extensions to the milestones schedule. Overall, there's a cap, a ten year cap on extensions. So that puts us if you and that's from the milestone schedule. So 15 years, they're being very aggressive about their schedule. They get to ten year cap on all extensions and I'll outline what those are. So that puts kind of the outside date at 25 years of five years past the 20 year term that was contemplate in the in a only if certain thing only if they are able to to qualify for certain extensions, extension payments, they're allowed to take five extension extensions by paying the city for those extensions. Those extensions are much more expensive before phase one at 50% of phase one infrastructure, $50,000 an acre after phase one infrastructure that goes down to 10,000 acre. The thought there is really that once that phase one infrastructure, the phase one infrastructure is a very large amount of work. And so once they've made that investment, we believe their incentive is to build the project and get it done because so much money has gone into it. So we've kind of reduced the option payments so they have an elect they can elect to extend those major milestones, closing completion of infrastructure, completion of vertical by paying the city to extend. That's and that's limited to only five of the ten years. Then there are two other ways that the term well three other ways but economic force majeure which is if the economic there's an economic downturn, that there's a decrease in the home price index or a certain number of years that they can qualify for an economic force majeure extension, and that it's a very high bar. And so it's really comparable to what we experienced in the recent recession. We had our financial consultant, Wealden, who's here today, actually chart out that index over 20 years or something over 20 years. And the only two times we met that threshold was when there was a really severe recession. So we've kind of calibrated this index to recessions that have occurred in the past. So we feel comfortable that we're only going to be in that economic force majeure situation when we're really experiencing a significant downturn in the economy and then a standard force majeure, which is which is more standard, which is really things that, you know , major issues like a disaster or essentially water supply. There is no water supply or some major disaster, a war or some other thing where there are major issues outside of Alameda Point Partners and the Cities Control, then they would be allowed to take extensions. The last is a Navy delay. So that's if the city is doesn't get the land by the timeline. If we can't actually give them the land to develop it, they don't want to be punished or, you know, for us not being able to give them the land to develop the property, obviously it's very hard to develop the property without the land. And so we've allowed for this circumstances. So the city has in the milestones schedule certain dates by which it's expected to provide the land in order to meet all these timelines. And so there would be a delay related to that overall, except for the Navy delay, which isn't subject to the cap, all these other delays are subject to the ten year cap on extensions. And really the thought there is, you know, at some point, if we have ten years, for instance, a worst case scenario of some sort of standard force majeure or a war or something like that, we should probably all sit down and figure out whether or not this project still makes sense. I mean, this can't go on forever. And so we wanted to cap that. And again, that cap is on the 15 year schedule, not the 20 year term. So it, you know, really only puts the city's kind of outside liability in terms of extensions to the 25 years of the. Before you continue at 11:00, we need a motion to continue our meeting and it requires three votes. Okay. All those in favor. I. Oppose. Oppose passes 4 to 1. So that's that's kind of I wanted to to highlight this. If you've got questions about this, it's kind of we've gone over with the NRA, had a lot of information on the terms the price in terms of payment. We've talked about that a lot. We haven't really talked about this. We've kind of recently come to an agreement on this. I wanted to put this out there as quickly as possible so that you're not you know, you're getting exposed before the 16th to a lot of the major issues so that there aren't, you know, any major surprises on June 16th. So that's why I'm raising it now. Happy to answer questions tonight or moving forward. But I wanted to highlight these issues to you, to the council and the public. So the next thing is really the site, a financing plan. What that and what that is is really what they've provided is required in the NRA, that they provide us a financing plan that shows how this project is going to work. The finances of they provided that to us in the form of a land development cash flow analysis. I am going to explain what that is. But really as the city, being the landowner and entering into a public private partnership where you're essentially selling the land to private entity to come in and develop it, it's very important for the city to understand the economics of the deal so that it understands that it's not selling the land for too little or that there are the understands that their what what the developers committing to in terms of infrastructure, that you're creating parameters around the economics of the deal and that the city is making sure it's protecting its financial interests. And so the developer provided us their project perform our cash flow analysis, which is an accounting and a comparison of sources and uses of funds. So it's just kind of really just means revenues and expenses over time. And we have that. We had our financial consultant review all the assumptions in that to make sure that it's been vetted independently, that we're not just taking the developer's word for it, and that's really broken out. I'm going to walk through each of these so that people understand how this works with the sources of funds or revenues include mainly land sale proceeds. So because it's a land development proforma, it has all the revenue is related to selling land and getting land ready for improved land ready for sale. So the land sale proceeds are essentially the way you calculate these is by looking at how much you think you're going to build or sell something or rent something for. So how much you're going to sell the townhomes for, for instance, how much is it going to cost you to build them? What is the difference between how much you'll sell them for versus cost? What's that difference? The difference is the land value. It's called a residual land value. That is what's used to determine the land sale proceeds in this model. That's very standard for this type of situation. And then you do that for every product type and it's based on market assumptions about rents. And we're going to I'll talk about those in a sec about sales prices, rents for retail, rents for commercial. And so you had in your packet assumptions about all of those things as well, because it's important for in order to value land, you need to understand what ultimately the land is going to be used for and the value of it. And so that's all built into this model, the other revenue source. To tell me that I'm going too fast. But, you know, slow down if I'm going too fast or I'm not explaining something clearly, I want to make sure everyone understands this. But the other revenue is a public financing mechanism. It's called community facilities district bond or district bond proceeds. You just recently approved this for Alameda Landing. This is a very standard way to you, basically leverage the value of the land to secure bonds, to pay for infrastructure, and then property owners in that area pay a special tax essentially in the special taxes. What's used to pay back those bonds for infrastructure? We do assume that in this case that there will be bond proceeds for infrastructure. The also developed equity, although not a true it's not really a revenue, it's a source of funds. But any time in the proforma that you see that there's a negative so that it revenue or, you know, expenses exceed revenue and there's a negative the developers potentially using equity to pay for those shortfalls in those years. So there is money that the developer, they're writing checks to cover shortfalls in years. And so that's part of their are a source of funds to to pay for the development or for the land development uses of funds, essentially expenses. They include pre-development costs. So all the costs of the developer spending out on the development plan, on the negotiation of the DDA, all of the design review applications, you know, the architecture expenses to put the design review applications together and go through the planning process, all those will be considered pre-development costs and they're just what they sound like, all the costs that kind of gets you to the point where you can actually develop something and get it entitled that you actually allow and permitted, that you're now allowed to actually build something are considered pre-development costs, land payments. Those are in the the staff report. Those are the $5 million for the sports complex, the $10 million ferry terminal payment, $15 million land payment phase, zero activities, site preparation. So this means demolition of buildings. It means any geotechnical remediation to make sure that you mitigate any settlement issues or seismic issues in the land, any grading that has to occur then the infrastructure costs. So those those are when we've talked about the $88 million, that's all those parks, the 15 acres of parks, all the roads, all of those infrastructure costs are counted here, professional services, the cost it'll take to actually design the infrastructure and then developer overhead to essentially kind of manage that effort is also included. So that's kind of the one on one on land development, cash flow and how it works and what was in your packet. And this is the tool that we use to really try to assess the the economics of the deal continued there's we also want to make sure, as I mentioned, that the city's getting a good deal. So how do we determine feasibility of the project? How do we determine whether or not we're getting a fair price for the land and we. We talk about return requirements. So we're and so what we've essentially built into the agreement is the city at some point we agree. Developer you're taking all this risk, a lot of risk building a lot of infrastructure. You're doing all these things. There's a lot of complexity. So you should be essentially you get the market rate of return, not a guarantee, but you should achieve a market rate of return on your investment. And we have to talk about what that market rate of return is. Of course, that's subject to negotiation. But ultimately, the city, at some point, once you've reached your market rate of return, the city wants to participate. This is our land. We've invested a lot of money in the air, the other entitlements, staff time. So we want to start participating. Once you've reached that threshold of market rate return, we want to participate. And so but it's really intended to be a windfall protection. The city it's in staff's approach to this. We have tried to negotiate a lot of upfront infrastructure. So the sewer line or the ramp, you know, Ralph, our Bazardo extension, try to frontload as much of that because from our standpoint, getting built improvements in early parks, for instance, all those things, Bill Early actually gives us something concrete that the community, not just people live in Alameda but all of Alameda can enjoy. So we don't see this as a way to make a ton of money for the city. What this is intended to do is, hey, if you are wildly successful developer, you shouldn't just run away with all these profits. We need to share too, because we've taken risks, we put in money, it's our land. So we need to have some kind of recognition that you're putting in this investment. You get to meet your rate of return. But ultimately, we want to participate in any in any profits above a certain above a certain threshold. So that's what this contemplates, is called profit participation. It's again, it's intended to be a windfall protection. Well, we have talked about this is what we're proposing as city shares and profits. Once our main point partners obtains market rates of return of two returns, an 18% internal rate of return and a 1.6 cash flow index. And I'll explain what those are. You want me? May I just ask explain what a 1.6 cash flow index is. Yes. So I'm going to let me start with the internal rate of return, because not everyone may know what that is either. And these are going to be kind of high level explanations. And I can if you have other detailed questions, I are consultant here to explain. But that idea with an internal rate of return as a way to measure profitability over time and essentially taking into consideration the time value of money. So this is kind of one of the only I shouldn't say only one of the most typical way to kind of recognize the fact that a dollar that you get next year is not worth the same as a dollar today that there. And so you sort of be able to measure profitability over time is essentially what the internal rate of return return does. And we have said, the developer said and we agree that, you know, given the risk of this project and a lot of the uncertainties you're going to, you know, will allow you to reach an 18%. That's a market rate of return of 18%, internal rate of return before we participate. But we also recognize is that they they want to achieve both an 18% internal rate of return and a 1.6 cash flow index. And the castle index is a way to essentially compare profitability to equity. So how much they make versus how much they've had to invest, that's a very high level. But that's basically is this kind of really recognizing the relationship between profit and equity investment on the developer's part. And so that's what that cash flow index measures. And so they in order for the city to start participating, the developer has to meet both of those threshold returns. Now, I want to be clear, there's no guarantee the city is not guaranteeing that they get these all the and that's part of why they get the, you know , these rate of returns. And they are what they are is because there's a risk, there's a chance they don't meet those at all. And that risk that something goes wrong and they've invested all this money and, you know, something does happen and they don't get those returned. The city isn't guaranteeing that they get those returns in any way, but once they do, then the city starts participating kind of at an increasing share of the profits. So starting at 18%, assuming they meet the 1.6 cash flow index, the city would start participating about 10% of the profits, and then that goes up over 20%. It's 20% profit position, 20 to 30. And then when they hit the 25% IRR, the city would start. Every dollar would be split essentially between the developer and the city. Again, this is all in the DDA. It's it's probably more than people want to know. But it's it's a want you to understand that we have tried to really protect the city's interest in terms of making sure the developer doesn't, you know, use the land and develop it and then run off with a bunch of profits. And this will all all of these detailed provisions are in the DDA. And I just want to say quickly that that's an important point that you just mentioned, because if you take a look at the way that it's structured, I mean, one can conceivably. I envision a scenario where. Where someone hits the air threshold at 22% and suddenly say. I don't want to give 30% of the profit. And so there has to be some mechanism where we can evaluate the amount of investment, equity and all that kind of stuff. So that's what we're looking. Among other things. And I did forget to say that we have kind of analyze, ah, so what is, is this we've kind of looked at their performance, their cash flow and determined three main things that I think are important to mention. One is that they do show that they're achieving a 22% IRR that is, we believe, a feasible project. So we believe that what they're proposing is feasible financially given the assumptions that are that are in there. We also think it's important to mention that, you know, we don't we don't think there's a excess land value. I mean, there's kind of methods that they're given. We've kind of maxed out with the infrastructure that's being proposed here in the land. But the $15 million land payments, what's it showing is that there is an excess land value that we're kind of leaving on the table. And then the last thing is that based on what the numbers that are in there, we would not be receiving any profit participation based on this. They're very close to meeting the 1.6, but haven't quite yet. And so we're not what they're showing is we think we have a feasible project, but we've kind of maxed it out in terms of infrastructure and land payments, and there really isn't any windfall at this point. That doesn't mean there won't be. These are all just assumptions, right. And so ultimately, it's going to be based on what did they actually sell things or how much did it cost to build? And those will get plugged into the analysis as we move forward with development. So so that we'll be keeping track of that. Every phase will be keeping track of what did you how where did your revenues come out? Where did your costs come out? Let's look at that. Do you owe us any money? Do not. And if after a given phase, it shows that they are meeting those two thresholds and there are excess profits, then we will actually be putting those funds into an account. We we don't it doesn't mean we get that money necessarily because you got to kind of wait till the end of the project to figure out if how did it all turn out. But we do want is we want those funds segregated into a separate account so so that we don't they don't think of it as their money. It's really our money until it's kind of proven that that it's not ours anymore. And so it's just kind of keeping it separate, making it being thought of as is different than money that they're able to use for other things. So that's how, how we've structured that. So I want to I know there's been a lot of questions about rents and monthly rental rates, and so I wanted to touch on this. I put this table together. I thought it would be helpful. But you look at it's a lot of numbers, but the intent is to really show convert different based on the area median income and it varies by household size what the rents would be for very low, low moderate. And then the estimated market rents I'm just going to go through these quickly is assuming someone has an income of about 32 to $38000, they'd be paying $854 a month for one bedroom if they met that kind of very low category. And then it goes up the bigger the household size. And so you see for a three bedroom, we are assuming a four person household size that's about $46,000 income. They'd be paying a little over 1100 dollars in rent. And obviously that goes up there. The project is providing about is providing 16% and these very low, low categories, 9% in the moderate and then the rest as both this is rental rates, but obviously there's townhomes as well, we believe. And what you see here is, I mean, when you look at the moderate incomes at 120% of the area, median income, someone making about, you know, anywhere between 78 and $90,000 would be paying about 2000 their market rent based on the rents that are in the performa that we have peer reviewed and looked at would be paying about 20 $600 a month, you know, in a one bedroom apartment. The townhomes obviously are more expensive. The townhomes are looking at more in the $900,000 per unit range. The condos in the second phase are looking at closer to about $700,000 range. So, you know, we believe this shows you that there is kind of a spectrum of housing that's being provided to a lot of different income categories. Before we move on. Yes. When you look at this chart, how in order to qualify, for instance, of first category below 50%. How many people are in your families for these different categories? Isn't it based on existing households? So I made certain assumptions that the one bedrooms would be one in two person households. This would be 2 to 3 person households. And then they are I'm sorry, this is 3 to 4 and then this is four. So I had to make those assumptions because the way that the area median income is calculated is based on household size. So I made the assumption that again, one bedroom is a 1 to 2 person household, two bedroom is a 3 to 4 and then three bedroom is a four person household and they don't have anything beyond . Four as a five. There's no five person household, so they only. Calculated two bedroom. You said 3 to 4, there's 3 to 4. And that's because it's overlapping the numbers. These are overlapping just because they don't they don't have a five person house. So once you hit the four person household, that is. Okay. So when I'd like this chart to include but the household members to qualify for these numbers when we see this again. Sure. And then your prices for the condos. But what did you say they were the condos. They started phase two. So they're priced at about 700,000 per unit. Okay. And this is what's in the performance. I want to be clear on that. Market rents and market prices is that these are market rents and market prices. So if the economy goes down, this could be less as the economy continues to go the way it is, these could be more. So I want to disclose that this isn't they're not guaranteeing these rents at these prices. This is what's in the performa. We have reviewed those versus what we looking at the market. Our independent consultant has looked at them. We think these are reasonable, honestly high end for for what you're seeing in Alameda now. But we believe these are reasonable assumptions to have in the financing plan. And I thought I heard you say that we're building in the old Warren Buffett margin of error just in case something goes wrong and the rents go down. So that because we have fixed allocations and the rents go down or the property values go down, we still want the sports complex and all that. So. We factor that in? Well, I think what this for the sports complex and the ferry terminal payment, once we transfer the phase one land to the developer, that $50 million is nonrefundable. Okay. So the on the condos are those one and two bedrooms. But but what you're describing is a condo. Or how many square feet? You know. I don't know if it's on my head. All right. So that's something else I'd want to know is on condos. What we're talking about? Sure. How many square feet? One one. One two bedroom. What is what is being described as a condo? Oh, okay. And then the three bedrooms. Those are townhomes. Is that what you don't know? The estimated? We didn't do any for sale on this. I'm just doing because I know there were a lot of questions about rent, so I just didn't rents. I didn't include all I meant when I was talking about the townhomes and condos was to show you that those are those are obviously for people making you know, those are given the mortgage payments for a $900,000 townhome. All I meant was that I kind of think of this as this kind of increasing kind of spectrum of housing product that that once after these market rents for apartments, you're getting into people who can afford essentially townhome or condos so that you're providing different product, housing, product or a mix of incomes. From the very low to the person who can afford a 900,000 square foot are 9000 $900,000 townhome. Okay. So now. Oh. Okay. So approach to fiscal neutrality. The city in 2003 adopted a fiscal neutrality policy that says we need to make sure that Alameda point essentially doesn't become a burden to the general fund that we that we analyze and make sure that the revenues are balanced with the expenses. And these are tax revenues versus city expenditures. So our approach to fiscal neutrality, you know, we have to be thinking talk about this is this is the first development we're not take we're not doing a big master developer for the whole thing . So we need to be thinking how do we structure this now for this space is, you know, let's set up let's figure out a approach that makes sense that we're going to take and be consistent to take with every development as we go, since we're taking a more incremental approach to development. So we, James Edison and Will, Dan and myself were keeping that in mind as we kind of went through this is let's let's create a methodology essentially for how we evaluate projects out there to make sure we're complying with this and that we're mitigating any impact. So I'm going to go over a couple of these are more of a high level kind of approach, and then I'll get into the actual numbers. But obviously let's comply with the policy. Second, we need to actually analyze the net fiscal impacts of Alameda Point. So that means estimate revenues, estimated expenditures when you compare them, are there any adverse or negative impacts when you compare them? We are taking this approach of fiscal neutrality and we are going to be setting kind of mitigations that are going to be kind of set. And so what we want to do, whereas we did an analysis on the fiscal impacts of when we did the entitlements for the entire Alameda point, it was for the entire development envelope. What are the impacts in this case? We think is very important to be very fiscally prudent and use reasonably conservative assumptions in setting this, because we don't you know, we don't know exact these are projections. We don't know exactly what's going to happen over 20 years. So we want to be on the the conservative side in terms of making our assumptions. So we're so and I'll talk about some of those conservative conservative the biggest conservative assumptions we made in this analysis. And then ultimately we need to mitigate the negative impacts through special taxes and or developer payments. And I'll talk about that in a second. But special tax is basically you approved this recently for Alameda Landing. It's a community facilities district for services. And that means that property owners are paying more in addition to the 1% property tax that goes towards essentially will go toward to the general fund in the road funds to pay for maintenance of roads, to pay for fire, to pay for police, and then develop a consistent approach for each incremental development. So developers are kind of clear how this works and the rationale behind it. So what did we do? First, we determine the net fiscal impacts of the entire Alameda Point project with all the planned facilities using conservative assumptions. So all plan facilities means a new fire station. It means all of the parks that are out there. And we made one pretty major conservative assumption, which is the entire entitlement value. Me point is five and a half is 1425 housing units. Five and a half million square feet of commercial commercial is beneficial to the the to the to the fiscal mainly because you have impacts that your residents are there both during the day and the evening. And so they tend to have bigger impacts. And so what we didn't want to do is assume, you know, over 20 or 30 years, we don't know are we going to get 3 million square feet of commercial? Four and a half, five and a half. So let's be concerned where we are shooting to get as much jobs as possible. But four, since we're setting special taxes and we're trying to be fiscally prudent, let's assume something more conservative. So we actually assumed a three and a half million square feet of commercial and the 1425 housing units. Obviously, if we get five and a half million square feet of commercial, that is better for the general fund and will be will be a benefit to the general fund. But since we're setting these special taxes now, we want to be careful because they're not easy to change. So we want to be careful to have conservative assumptions built into how we estimate them. So that result, when we did that analysis, was a $900,000 deficit, mainly not to the general fund. The general fund was a surplus, but the road fund, a significant new road, Miles. And so when you combine all of the funds that we looked at, the overall deficit was $900,000. Okay? So now we know we've got it. We've got an issue when we're using conservative assumptions that we need to mitigate because we need to meet that fiscal neutrality policy. So we need to assign every development, their fair share of that deficit. And the site, a fair share of the 900,000 is $311,000 that they that they have agreed to essentially create a special tax that will generate, at buildout $311,000 annually to the general fund to mitigate their portion of these impacts. And those. So that's the second step. The third step. Biz Well, what about in the beginning years when you might have some facilities but not all the development paying revenues and paying the special tax? Are there kind of temporal impacts or impacts in the beginning and over time? So let's do another analysis and let's look. In this case, we estimated the net fiscal impacts of each incremental development, obviously in this case site a by phase. And so what we looked at was phase one, face to face three. In phase one, there are negative impacts even after they pay their share of special tax. Yashar Can I ask you quick question just before you get to the the different phases? So in the I'm in that paragraph in the staff report, it's on page seven and the section is Results of Fiscal Impact Analysis. And in the first paragraph down near the bottom is the sentence that so it talks about the development in Alameda point is actually expected to generate a net positive impact on the city's general fund of a certain amount, net positive impact on the city's library fund and a net adverse impact on the city's street related funds of $1.2 million. And my question was. Explain why the city's street related funds are negatively impacted if the developer is paying so much in backbone infrastructure costs. Well, because those are what they're paying for. And background infrastructure costs are the capital. This is the cost to maintain the roads and to keep them at a certain level maintained at a certain level. And there are a lot of roads there. There are a lot of bike facilities or a lot of roads. And so we've estimated all of the different kind of road miles and sidewalks, linear feet and all of that, and determine what it would cost to maintain all those roads. And there aren't when you look at the street funds, there aren't a lot of dedicated street revenues to to do that. And so in this case, when you combine all those little bridges. No toll bridges. Yeah, exactly. So it is an impact. So you've got a lot of facilities and not a lot of dedicated revenues to that. So it creates it creates an impact, I think. So Councilmember Odie and I were just talking about the the net impact and we were just basically distributing the net impact of $300,000 in number to over 800 units. Granted that it's also going to be distributed over commercial as well. But just just for math sake, right. That comes out to be $375 to which for residents to which I, I thought that the reason why it's kind of low is because you're distributing the net impact over 800. Whereas if you distributed the total impact, it'd be something else. Correct. Right. I mean, if you because you're mainly netting out all your other revenues. And so it's not just the cost, but you're saying the general funds going to your property tax for sure. You're going to get transfer tax over time. You get sales tax. We take into consideration all those revenues as well and then compare and then essentially compare them to costs. And how do those compare? And the reason why that's important to mention is because the Bayport. They're paying $1,000 a year on for MSD. Mm hmm. And all you need to do for those who are so interested in the Internet, just go to their county assessors and you'll see that there's $1,000 for each residents. And that's the that's basically the CFD MSE for, for Bayport, whatever it is for Alameda landing. I don't know. But. And you know, I guess my question was, you know, what do we estimate? You know, each parcel that annual tax is going to be or do we not know that now or. We don't know that exactly. I mean, we ultimately it's it's. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, we, you know, we it's hard because you can it does depend on how you allocate it to commercial versus residential and how we do that. And the developer, in some cases, commercial development is actually much more sensitive to special taxes than than residential. The way that we kind of structured is that what we said to the developer, we went through an $11,000 a year. We're going to you're going to have a special tax. Certainly your townhomes are going to have those on them. You know how you figure out how you apportion that special tax. We're going to figure out and you're going to come tell us because we're going to end up approving a CFD ultimately for that. But what we what we care about most is that we're assured that $311,000 a year. Yeah, I just was, I think one, I want to clarify one thing. So I think the situation where Bayport was that and this is the genesis of the fiscal neutrality policy is that Bayport at the time was part of redevelopment area where the or the baseline was zero or pretty close to zero. So everything was was basically tax increment. So that's why you had to capture the for the full value. Whereas I think you're doing your analysis where, where there's some property tax that's coming down Alameda solar so that the 1% ad valorem and the Alamo is 25% share is coming to us. That's right. But then there's still there's still a discrepancy and that's why we add the brackets. Right. And. Yeah, exactly. And I think we actually ran a sensitivity because the state has approved things like the infrastructure financing districts. And so we actually ran a sensitivity. If you we don't assume any of these or infrastructure financing districts for that, which is really a reapportionment of that 1% ad valorem tax, if you did this impact would be much bigger and you'd have to mitigate a much bigger amount. And again, I mean, this these are conservative assumptions that we tried to make throughout the analysis. If you were to if you if we're successful getting five and half million square feet of commercial, there won't be any impact. I mean, that's what we estimate. There wouldn't be any where we want to be conservative, make sure we're being fiscally prudent. And so we've assumed something that we think's more realistic in the 20 year time frame, the three and a half million square feet. So let me let me just keep going, but feel free to interrupt. And this is good. It's. So number three is to estimate the net fiscal impact of each incremental development by phase. So for let's just look at side eight and let's look at what facilities are actually built at the time CIDA is built. So we're not going to assume the fire station. The fire station is not part of the project. It's not necessary. So we're not going to penalize them. The full costs are or pro-rata share of the fire station. They do have to pay an average cost of fire expenditures because they're using fire services. But we're actually going to just look at the facilities that are actually there inside A to to to try to estimate whether or not there are any kind of incremental or temporal impacts on the general fund that we need to mitigate. And these would be mitigated through some sort of you know, it wouldn't be through a special tax, be some sort of payment or source because it's kind of a temporary impact. We did this and then we also compared it to one offset it with one time revenues, which are really property transfer taxes. And I'll show you the analysis on this, but based on pretty significant property transfer tax on just the ownership residential really offsets those impacts in that first year and I'll show you the numbers. But so we we start recommendation is there's no additional mitigation that's required for site A and then we also, you know, this is something that happens in other cities is if is there a single user that generates a significant amount of tax revenue that could present risk that if it does, it gets delayed or doesn't happen. So for instance, you know, a major retail user in this case, we have no kind of single user retailer that's huge. That would be generated. But like it out in L.A. would be like a target or something like that. Here we don't have that, but we do have a hotel and hotels generate pretty significant transient occupancy tax. So we did actually take the hotel out and it build out. You know, there are no there's no there's no impact. There's still site is positive. And I should say our number three overall a build out site A is positive. It generates more revenue to the general fund than it does expenditures. So I want to make that clear. Yeah. May I take you back to number one under this approach to fiscal mitigation? And so that was determine the net fiscal impacts of the entire on midpoint development. And at the end, it says fiscal analysis in exhibit nine estimates its impact will be a negative annual impact of 871,000 at build out. Mm hmm. How how how many years is this estimated deficit expected to last? Is that just the year we get to build out? Or when it when it's at build out, it means build out. So it means kind of the assumption is, you know, that that could be going forward. Going forward. But that doesn't I mean, again, there are a number of factors that could influence that. The more commercial you get, the more retail sales tax. If there's a major business to business user, you know, there are other factors that could play in here. But we've tried to be conservative in our assumptions. And so that's where that's right. That that's kind of at build out what the impact would be. And and. The annual impact. Okay. I appreciate that. Is this a deficit page from the general fund? Where is it? Where does it come from? So the deficit. So let me go to the next slide. So the the deficit, if you take all those funds revenues, the property tax, sales tax, utility users tax, we've estimated all of those expenditures, fire, police, everything. When you kind of net those, you know, compare those, you've got a deficit of the 900,000 that you're talking about that is and then site A has to mitigate its fair share. And so it's actually paid through a special tax so the general fund. Every development is going to have to pay their fair share of that 900,000. So every development that comes into the city, we're going to say, all right, here's the impacts. You pay your fair share. The idea is and the methodology is that at the end of the day, once it's all developed, you're going to have sufficient funds to cover any deficit. So that there would be no impact. Our hope is that everything's wildly successful and all the taxes are even more than we think. And, you know, you're collecting honestly. I mean, you're collecting special tax revenue and you're not having a negative impact because it's much. But since we don't know and we have to determine it now, we want to be conservative and use conservative protections going forward. Thanks. So this is the summary of the. Oh yeah. Member already. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. So. See if I just understand this correctly. So we're expecting transfer tax and property tax in. The transient hotel tax. And so we're expecting that to come in, in, you know, 17 or 18 or whatever. We're starting to do all this. And we've already pretty much assigned that revenue to expenditures already. That kind of. Well, it's just that it comes you know, it's not is some of these revenues you can track to to a specific property like a property tax you kind of know. But it just starts your revenues will start going up your expenses, too, because you'll be having more calls for service. So things are it's it's not going to happen overnight. Right. But you're going to. Sure, you're going to I mean, probably what you're going to see first are the revenues, right? Because you're going to really start to see a hit and you're going to get property transfer tax revenues. When all those first townhomes get sold right away, you're going to get a big hit and you'll see the numbers that we've estimated. And then once they once the property tax get on the rolls, you start to see increases in property tax. But over time, you're going to start to see increases in calls for service and other things and expenditures. So it's not that it's a sign, it's just that you're going to gradually have increases in revenues and increases in expenditures. And then just for my. Newness at this. So is that going to just sit in the general fund or are we segregating that in like the base re-use or. No, it will be the general fund. Right. So we have to be very careful when we get this in that we don't spend it because we know that, you know, it's pretty much spoken for, I guess. Right. I mean, it's going to the general fund and we need to be aware that there are going to be increases in expenditures over time as well. Absolutely. Okay. So this is I know this is a big tale, but I want to walk through it quickly. So this is the analysis of site. So this was kind of the overall how do we set that special tax? Because we're going to set that special tax. And it's very difficult to change it once it's kind of in place. And so we're going to require that this amount that they are obligated to pay this amount at build out every year. Then we say again, going back to our methodology. Let's look at what are the impacts on a temporary basis are. Well, let's look at it by phase by phase for site. When you look at site in total, we're expecting with mitigation that the impacts will be positive to the general thought about $700,000, but they're still paying the 311 every year. But we think their project, based on the facilities that are in place now or at the end of phase of site, there will be some benefits to the general fund over time. But let's look at it by phase, because things, services and facilities are kind of lumpy. And so you do see that in that first phase there is kind of a net impact of 500,000. The fiscal mitigation we're estimating would be 200,000. So you've got a temporal impact in that first year phase one, but you're collecting $1.1 million in transfer taxes and then the transfer taxes in phase two. And this is just for for sale residential. So you may there may also be transfer taxes for other uses, but those are speculative because they may just hold some of those the commercial properties they'll probably hold and not transfer. So we just assumed, you know what, no transfer tax from that, just the townhomes, essentially, and then the condos and townhomes in the second phase and you get a pretty big hit. And so staff's recommendation is that this these hits and transfer tax more than cover any temporal or temporary deficits that you may have in some of the earlier phases. Before you move on. Vice Mayor. This. I just want to make a comment that phase three kind of aligns with the purpose smoothing problems that we have. When we go back to the our general fund discussions back a couple of weeks ago. So one of the questions I had is, did your estimates? To set the tax, anticipate or graduate at the same rate that is driving. When we look at the general fund projections on a downward slope. So that the special tax is estimated to escalate CPI every year and it has to be tied it's tied to actual cost of maintenance or expenditures of maintenance. So and it will escalate over time. But not the municipal service tax. So the municipal service tax will escalate at the CPI. So it has I'm not going to say an inherent structural defect built in in a way that it doesn't track at the same escalation. Right. So it. Doesn't contributions. Well, right. The the inflation factor will be CPI as opposed to, you know, a city municipal expenditure rate or something like that. It'll be tied to CPI, is that correct? And Brody. I think you had Amir. One more. What kind of request? Phase one is 15 through 19, right? Mm hmm. And then it looks like the bulk of the sales are in 17. I mean, is there some way when when we look at this, we can kind of see, you know, by by fiscal year what the estimated impact on on our general fund is as opposed to buy phase? Yes. So we can we can break it out. I mean, we can do that. It's a it's we just make assumptions by year. The only reason we didn't do that was just because we didn't want to give a sense, a little bit of false precision, because some of it is, you know, you know, but we can do it. And if it's analysis you guys would like to see, we're happy to do it. We just, you know, in some ways. Exactly, you know, trying to estimate exactly what's going to be in every year. It starts to get a little, you know. Well, based on those assumptions. I mean, two and three, you know, that's going out way far in the future. But I think for for phase one, which is, you know, the first five years, which yeah, you know, we're going to be, you know, this council's going to be setting the budget for. So it would just be helpful. Yeah. And we can do that. And we can also show you that the transfer taxes, kind of the one time transfer taxes for the for those years as well. So, sure, we can. Absolutely. Thank you. And I'm wondering what are your assumptions on your for sale residential? How many of the units are for sale? The residential? What's in the proforma? So it's, you know, I can pull up the numbers but it's anyone, remember. So I don't remember the exact number but it's whatever is in the perform I think it's. The 39 townhouse down home. How many? 139 townhomes. That value sale of 888,000 range. Mm. Or that's. It's the Willesden report. So. Exhibit 10 to. 70. So 270 for sale. For sale 274 sale. Total of. Is about. And that's your phase one. Or is that just overall 270. Overall for yourself. But but we and we assumed value in tax from all of the units and all the commercial. The only place we kind of limited to for say residential is on the property transfer tax because those are the ones. So that's what I'm looking at and trying to figure out how you made that calculation. Yes. And this is not below market rate, then this is all market rate, right? Yeah, but that has to be a transfer tax on the the rental building because someone will buy it. I'm James Edison from Will, then financial services consultant to the city. So what we assumed was so for the recent offer sale, which I think some of the moderate or also some of the moderate or for sale and then the market rate for sale, those are the only units we assumed in what we assumed was a the city's transfer tax rate, you know, the 12, $12 per thousand valuation. The reason it's a big hit in is because when the first sale happens, every single unit has a transfer tax. After that, it happens as that as a unit. So it just depends on people's lives. And, you know, that can vary quite a bit. But when when the initial sale happens, when that first family moves in, that means every single unit results in transfer tax. And so it's a it's a big number right out of the gate, but it only happens once. It's not annual. I mean, it's annual in a sense. It it may occur over several years, but we've calculated for the phase that's sort of a one time payment essentially on the commercial. It really depends on the disposition of the property. You know, if someone purchases the property, I mean, you can have a transfer tax at that point. But then if they didn't develop it from there and, you know, build their building and do the rest of it, their assessed value will change. You know, a reassessment will happen, but there won't be any transfer necessarily. So you won't have a transfer tax. You may see those. But in the interest of being conservative, we didn't assume any because they might not happen. When I was a counselor, you asked about we did assume in the annual cash flow. So this is I mean, those are the one time expenses this row here. When we calculated the model, we do assume a certain amount of all the units in the commercial transfer every year. But it's a small percentage here. You're talking about all of them, 100% of the for sale units transfer. So you get that big hit over time over on the model, we assume every year some portion of the unit, some portion of commercial turns over and you do get a transfer tax revenue. You just don't get that big hit like you do in the beginning. So we do assume property transfer tax revenue over time as well. Thank you. So I think that's it. I'm happy to answer any any question I have, Joe. I think Joe answered with important point partners wants to just say a couple of things. And then if you have more questions about the fiscal, though, or the financial, you know, I can answer those now. Yes. So thank you. And is that so. Let's see. Down on the. Um. Page eight. There's the reference that the tax. My question. Let me just find it. Well, my question is, why is the tax burden higher for residents than for commercial 1.9% versus 1.8%? All right. That's a good a good question. And so when negotiating the in and the term she was attached to the NRA, there's commercial uses tend to be much more sensitive to special tax, special taxes and whereas residences, you know, honestly, we all I mean, we don't it's it's just a reality where people don't pay as much attention and they're just not as sensitive to how much of a tax burden there is. And so you're allowed you're able to burden residential users a little more without seeing an impact to value. And again, we kind of use these numbers that are in there, the 1.8, 1.9 to do the analysis. But the end of the day, what we care about is now that we've done all the technical work we care about, is it $311,000 if they decide they want to kind of prepay that on some of the commercial because they want to lower the burden and they want to put more on the residential. You know, we can you know, we're kind of allowing some flexibility because now we've kind of done the analysis to figure out what we think those amounts should be. And then and it's not just the municipal services special tax, but it's the team plan and the operations and transit services that they're funding. It's flood control maintenance, flood control reserve. So there are a number of different things that the city is saying. Our priorities that we want to be collecting funds for from this development to make sure that we're being prudent about maintaining the resources we have out there and providing the services that are so key to the transportation program . Thanks. Okay. Well, we don't have any speakers. Which I think I think. You want to sites with a search. Yes. Sorry. Thank you. Good evening, members of the council. Joe Ernst with Alameda Point Partners. We're very pleased to get our planning board approval last week. Having 29 supporters with varying messages. A lot of new faces, you know, and we will continue that outreach with the community. There's been a lot of talk about housing, but I want to be clear. You know, we haven't lost our focus about a lot of the things we've heard from the community from the very outset about what the community wants. Clearly, jobs and the things businesses need, you know, the the parks, the amenities, the housing, the rental, you know, those are things, you know, business. I think this project, you know, we've talk about jobs, but it's also important what it will do for creating jobs at the base, affordable housing. We have Linda Mammoliti here tonight. I'd like to get her to say a few words, too, about some of the affordable housing. You know, with the housing. Again, you know, there's enough here to support the goals to pay for a lot of the things that are in this proforma, that, you know, the things we want. You know, there will be a diversity of housing types. There's been a lot of questions about different housing types. But we have a, you know, enough here. You know, we using, you know, size of product, you know. To. To target a lot of different parts. Of the market between affordable and market rate. We've clearly tried to tailor this to, again, demographic that, you know, is going to support transit, that we want to support the retailers, the amenities which are so critical to attracting business. And it's very resource efficient. You know, certainly in our time here of water shortage, I think what's very important with the with site is the. Capital investment and the message they. Will send and the importance of of this project. You know, we've had a chance now to. Meet with all the businesses out at the point and talk to them about their business and their futures. We've talked to other businesses that have expressed interest in. You know. Our project and other things we're working on. You know, it's very clear that a lot of the businesses out there, from Nortel to a county power even right speed. A new tenant, you know, making very minimal. Investments in their buildings. And it's largely due to uncertainty about infrastructure. And so I think this, you know, getting city underway is going to send a real strong message to the capital markets, going to send. A real strong message to these companies. It's going to send a real strong message to good businesses that we want to locate here. I think, you know, the housing is going to support good transit, both infrastructure and services. And we want to be a catalyst for expanding this throughout the rest of the city. Again, I'm going to have Elinda talk a little bit about affordable. But, you know, we really want to realize what renewed hope, you know, has achieved with the 25% affordable housing. We've done some preliminary jobs analysis here. And, you know, with site development, we're looking at about 3700. Construction jobs. That will translate into about 185. Million in wages. And, you know, we have in. The. In our DDA, you know, we're targeting. 25%. Minimum, you know. Toward, you know, local Alameda residents, Alameda County, and also going to be working with the collaborative for apprenticeships. So, you know, we hope to see a lot of those wages stay right here. You know, permanent jobs, you know, based on the mix of businesses, hotel. Retail and, you know, the innovation, especially manufacturing. Looking at about 1700 permanent jobs, of course, sales tax. TOTTY Given the blend of commercial uses, we are making good progress on a project labor agreement with the building trades and we're hopeful we'll have that wrapped up in the next week or so. And you know, is part of our commitment to bringing jobs. You know. Through the lease structures that we've negotiated as part of the DDA, we are committing to at least getting one of those buildings that are in phase in our phase three, getting that redeveloped and activated with phase one. Building 117, about just under 100,000 square feet. So again, want to, you know, and a lot of talk about the housing, but clearly want to. Talk about the. Many benefits that come from this project. And so with that, I'd like to turn it over to Linda mann Bellini with Eden Housing to say a few words about the affordable. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Members of the council. As Joe said, I'm the president of Eden Housing. I'm happy to be here. I think this is actually in Eden's long term history, one of the best projects that we've been able to participate in. And I want to tell you why we don't often get asked to be in developments like this in this percentage. Frequently, the other inclusionary ordinances that we work with have 10 to 15%. They never have 25%. And I think the percentage of affordable housing here is actually quite exciting and really exceptional. And I would applaud the city for that and for that agreement. We're very excited because we can serve a range of affordability with this development and we can serve those who are most in need at the low end, but also take the rents up. As you saw in the slide that Jennifer put up, we have the ability to create create apartments that are significantly more affordable than the market can provide. And we think it's actually very important that these be rental. And that's largely because the developer here is investing a lot in the infrastructure. Eden could never be in a project like this and pay for that kind of an infrastructure investment. So the fact that we get to piggyback on that is really important, but it also gives us the opportunity when we do rental housing to leverage the new funds that might be coming from the state. And I want to say a very special thank you for the yes endorsement vote tonight on 1335 and 35. Both of those are very likely. Both of them are sources that are going to be directed in large part to rental housing and that they will be able to be leveraged on a project like this. Cap and trade also has a requirement for affordability that is significant. And so we think that it's really important that the affordable be mostly rental housing because we think that that's really the thing that's going to be the most successful financially. We also. Think it's the best use. Of what is in essence subsidy from the larger land development. We can serve more households by doing rental housing than you could if you were doing single family. So for example, if you were to sell a house at $900,000 and make that house affordable to someone at $300,000, the subsidy for that one house would be $600,000 for one household. For Eden, I could build three houses for that kind of subsidy and maybe four if they were one bedroom. So I think it's just a better use of the subsidy dollars coming from the developer for for us to to do rental. And so I did want to comment on that because I know there were some questions about that in other places and we're really excited about this. Honestly, I Eden won the Jack Kemp Award from ULI nationally last year for a big master planned development. And I'm now judging this year for that same competition. And I would tell you this is that kind of a development. It is the kind of development that will get national attention that really has a wide range of affordability. It affords the folks at the lowest end of the spectrum the opportunity to participate in all of the amenities that you're building. And that's really important. A lot of the developments that we work in, a lot of other communities, they'll take a check from the developer and go build it somewhere else. But this is really important to be built here. And so I just want to thank you for that because I think this is a really important aspect of the project, and I'm happy to answer any questions about affordability because I know there have been some. So thank you. Are there any other speakers point f it down with the presentation now. All right. Council members, vice mayor. Um, you know, I'll start out by saying that I've never been a fan of a town center. Um, I think I've been clear about that. One of the considerations, though, that I do have, and I wanted to make sure that we can verify that other action of the Planning Board was to take the old north housing and return the housing that's allocated to north housing to what was agreed with in the Navy in 29 at 415 units. And I just want a quick confirmation that when is that going to be? Fortified and established. Yeah. So that will be coming back to the Council on June 16th. At the same time. And that has a net effect of taking 800 units off the northern waterfront. Right. And that and project labor agreement, I think are two key, key things for me. I do have some other other questions and not questions, more comments and direction and things I'd like to see. One of them is I appreciate in-house in coming up here and being a participant in this, but. I was reading the affordable housing section in the overview of the DDA and that is separate and it's not incorporated in and what we see here in the and these are from our numbers and there is a term in there that talks about their ability or their maximize their potential for obtaining financing. And I'd like. The risk of them not obtaining sufficient financing not to be on the city. But to be on the developer because part of the promise and we when we hear the input from people part of the promise of this is to deliver 25% of the 800 units as affordable units. 128 of those are at Eden. And if they're depending on other other sources of of revenue to build these, including state funds. I don't want to get to the end of phase one and they don't have the funds and we not deliver the housing. So I think that risk should be on the developer and the city can do everything it can to help. But this is this is the promise. And that's what a lot of the support where a lot of the support is coming from. I'd also like to see. A little more meat behind the leasing and inclusion of jobs in phase one with some milestones because people are going to be living. One thing that's clear is they're going to be townhouses built. There's going to be an apartment built or apartments built, and eventually they'll be condos built. People will be living there. And one of the best ways to mitigate those people not driving up to the tube or trying to take a bus through the tube or a BRT is to have jobs close by. On the. The issue of. Having. The ferry. And I've seen that the ferry over the period of this discussion has been reduced to $10 million. And whether or not that's enough to build a ferry terminal. And then whether or not the fairies will come if we build the terminal, I think is still a risk because that's a promise that's out there that we're going to have a fairy. But I haven't seen a commitment yet from Wheaton to run a fairy. If we build a terminal and I don't know if $10 million can build the terminal, it doesn't sound like it. So that's another risk that we have in front of us that I'd like to push the push in another direction and it falls under transportation. There are a couple of things that we have to make sure that we do reality based transportation demand management. And I think one of that demands that we address the issue that keeps popping up, that there is only going to be one additional cars through the tubes at peak time. And whether or not that's true or not. I don't think it's true. But we have to get some numbers that are bona fide that say what what it's like today so that we can project it out on what we have to mitigate as these units become populated. And I think that is extremely important to have credibility when we're charging people who are going to be buying these units a substantial amount of money to transport them. Off the island if they have to work off the island. And then lastly, I mentioned the project labor agreement. I think it's very important to have these jobs local and I'm glad progress is being made. And that truly is a condition, I think that we have to stand by because it's public land. It's been used for this project. So those those are my comments and my input for tonight. All right. Member Ashcraft. I have a clarifying question on the statement about the reality based transportation planning and beside of you come up. Okay. I have definitely read in the newspaper from a local commentator that somewhere it said that Alameda Point development is only going to put one more car through the tube. Wasn't my understanding of what the report actually said. Is it not something more like the capacity only has room for one more to one more car through the tube? Do you want to state it? Yeah, I do. Completely that I am. Sure. I mean, the Aluminum Point Environmental Impact Report studied, I think 32 intersections, the impacts to 32 intersections in in Alameda and then a number in Oakland as well. And what it showed was that there will be, you know, with or without made a point, there are going to be significant impacts given all the regional growth. Aluminum point, as you know, there are impacts that Alameda Point contributes to. There are significant impacts. No one is saying that there's only one Alameda point generating one car. That's just not right. Absolutely. Will be generating cars. What happens is what that what that person. Kind of taking data. What it shows is that the tubes are essentially what kind of confirms and in a lot of ways what a lot of us know already, which is the tubes are generally essentially reaching capacity. Now, when you add more cars, what ends up happening, this is what you see in the analysis that was done is when you add more cars on the Western people that are driving from the, you know, the middle of the island or Eastern don't go into the tubes anymore. The tubes are capacities. What we would all do if you know intuitively they're going to they now then go to intersections on the East End. And so where you actually see a lot of the impacts in the traffic impact analysis are on the eastern around the Park Street Bridge, around the other crossings because people who would be kind of driving into the tubes today, let's say as the regional growth occurs, other growth occurs in Alameda, the tubes are going to reach capacity . And that's what the models are saying, is that your tubes only have so much traffic, you know, in there. And so what you see is they actually have spreading of traffic and then traffic that's diverting to other parts of the island. And thank you for that clarification, because it upsets me every time I see this reported in the newspapers, not so much reporting, but sometimes as an opinion piece and sometimes it gets front page coverage. But I just want us on the council when we're talking to the public to to have an understanding of what that means. And, of course, it ties into so much of what we've discussed already tonight about the need for getting the funding that we have the ability to apply for through the Alameda County Transportation Commission, both the federal grants and the state matching grants. And we're not burying our head in the sand. We're saying we do need to look at another model, which is giving people the opportunity to live and work in the same area and getting people who work out of the area, out of their single occupancy vehicles and on to public transit. But we have to make that possible. And we heard some very good opportunities tonight that are coming to us the best rapid transit and increased funding for ferry and other public transportation. Thank you there for that clarification. And I just. Want to add on that very important point about the increase of traffic from Alameda point as it flows, particularly through the outbound Posey Tube in the morning. On the when we decided the air, we actually discussed and evaluated that. And it was largely because when I was looking at the appendices, I did, in fact take a look at the circles that they had, the schematics and kind of said, okay, look, there's there seems to be something odd about the certain number of of cars going through the posi tube in one scenario relat. And then when you look at the cars going through the Posey tube, in another scenario, there didn't seem to be that much and there wasn't that much for the reason given by MZ Art this afternoon. This evening. And it was given back then when we discussed the air. Now, what we also did, though, is we also did back then when we discussed the air and said. Well, what. If we're. Wrong? So back in 2014, what we did in accepting the air and also doing the MIP or the mast master infrastructure plan for Alameda Point, we also had a failsafe just in case something didn't happen, didn't go as we had wanted to. So that is part of the discussion. That is part of the of the things that came out of the whole nip in the air for Alameda point discussion for that happened in 2014. So let it not be said that this council did not evaluate that very specific information that that is now, you know, gaining currency here in 2015. We discussed it in 2014 and however imperfectly, we made some policy decisions with regard to that. So if I maybe I'll just continue with some of my points. Okay. My points for tonight based upon this is again on transportation. Thank you very much for the changes that I saw. Once again, I love that 15 minute headway for the shuttle. I know it's not this answer to everything. And I know, you know, consultants said not to not to glom onto it, but I did. But also, the other changes that that were made was to make sure that, you know, we'll talk about three things about the shuttle possibly stopping at one or some other place. So I'm glad to see that language in the in the team. I think in going through the materials for this evening, I think that the my quick notes that I had was make sure that we have language that protects us and our interests. And our interest, for example, are like the sports complex. Make sure that we have a language that protects us in our interests in this development in the event of a recession. Now, everything that is had indicated tonight is that that will be part that is part of the DDA. So remember, she talked about, you know, economic force majeure and all those kind of things, because we do have however the project goes in terms of the sales, whether the commercial sales or whether the rental or whether the single family I mean, the the sales for those are subject to the markets at the time and markets at the time could be down. So however, the on the revenue side, those things go. We ourselves as a city want to see some cost that we want. We want to see costs like that, like the sports complex. So we don't want to do you know, we don't want to sacrifice those. And I think every everything that MDOT has indicated is that we've taken that into account. We also want to take into account the fact that, you know, we're going to hire more police officers, we're going to have more more fire people. And we might even, one assumes, some of those costs ahead of time. For example, you can't have half a half of a fire station. Right. So so, you know, you have to make a decision. So as we assume these costs, we want to make sure that we've factored in, you know, well, what if, you know, all of the property values go down because we have all these assumptions with regard to how revenues offset the costs and we have all these assumptions with regard to the impact fee that we're going to use. So but everything that to me suggests that they they're modeling that into into a DDA. Okay. Land banking, as always. One of the big issues that we learned from the Bay Port Alameda landing. So hopefully that will make sure to have a discussion about that things that I also want to take a look at a. Flushing out the corporate entity of who will be working with. A lot of times you want to know, you know, the corporate entity with who you're working with just in case things go wrong and you know, you just want to know things. And I like the that the extension payments that Miz was talking about. I just I think the question that I just wrote here was, are they automatic, though? And if we could just flesh that out later on. And also the mechanism, as I indicated earlier, kind of understanding the mechanisms for how we're going to score the IRR , because a lot of that is a function of, you know, what we think are the costs that the developer or whomever is assuming as an equity investment need of a project. So, you know, I mean, we got we got to make sure that we understand that. And I guess the last thing I have in mind is from the outset is I had indicated a variety of things that we're going to be deciding on on June 16th. One of the things that we as a council might want to think about is including the development plan itself. And the only reason why I would include the development plan, which was discussed by the planning board and voted on by the planning board. The only reason I would raise the possibility of including the development plan as part of the June 16th discussion is if for no other reason, for its ceremonial reasons. I mean, it is after all, you know, it's a it's a development plan for a key part of Alameda Point, which has taken us decades literally to get to this point. So from a ceremonial perspective, you know, to say hats off to former Mayor Withrow, former mayor opposed to former Mayor Johnson and and Maria Gilmore and all the previous councils, it's altogether possible that maybe we should have the council at least vote on the development plan as opposed to leaving it just to the Planning Board as part of our June 16th discussion. So largely for ceremony reasons, I get that that the development plan would probably be woven into the DDA. I understand that, you know, but we might have it. Think about that if for no other reason than ceremonial reasons as to why it should be included. Well, as my comments. Member, Ashcroft. Thank you, Mary Spencer. I want to thank the missus and the other presenters in Ms.. Madeleine. If I'm saying your name correctly, that was really inspiring to hear from you. And to that, the project we're aspiring to do at its site is it sets the bar high, even by the projects you've seen. And I like that. I we got a lot of external correspondence from various people actually supporting one of the letters. I was really impressed with and I'm just going to read it tonight. So it's, it's in their record in heard by the public because I think it really sums up a lot of of why we're doing what we're doing. So it says my husband Dan Corea and I are Olympians and retired employees of NASA Alameda. I was on the first brand committee for years working to decide what the best could and should become after closure. Dan worked his last year performing hazardous waste cleanup around the base. I spent my last years in the active center in building one or one, helping people find and apply for new jobs. Dan and I recently went on a tour of what is planned for the Seaplane Lagoon site. We were filled with hope at what could be done with this tired old base of ours. I remember. I remember when it seemed that the task of bringing the base back to life was just too daunting. Now we see that not only can new life happen, but this plan for society could honor our former base. Incorporation of existing buildings into the development plan would allow our history to continue into the future. At the same time, we have been watching as too much development seems to be changing. Alameda from the community we once knew. We think we have gone too far in changing neighborhoods that were not seeking their change. But we still think that the one place that does cry out for development is our old base. The proposed development there will not take away from what Alameda is. It is development that is sorely needed to allow that crumbling base to become something better than it is now. This is a plan for new life. We endorse it. Carol Fairweather and Dan Corea. Thank you. Member, Odie. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I'll try to be brief, because I think almost every comment that I've wanted to say has been said already. So she ate my my colleague's comments. I just want to focus on a couple of things. One, I'm glad that there's progress on the play, and hopefully I'd like to see that resolved by now. But I hope that you're getting into the nitty gritty of the negotiations and are able to report back soon that that's been taken care of. I was encouraged by the the acceleration of the commercial development. The point was made about we need to make sure we get jobs there sooner rather than later. And that I don't think we can underestimate the importance of the north housing realignment of of housing in our in a housing element. And I think I really want to commend the vice mayor for his leadership on this issue, because what it what this allows us to do is to consider this project in a way such a way that, you know, we're not adding housing to our housing element, where we're going to be able to consider this within the context of our housing element and not go over and build. You know, I guess I would call extra housing. So again, very, very strong and effective leadership on that issue by our vice mayor in bringing this this whole realignment idea to the council and to the staff back early in the year. So. That's basically my my comments. I'm glad that we've finally seen the financials. You know, we we saw the pro forma and closed a while ago. But I'm glad that, you know, the public now has an opportunity to review those. And, you know, this is, you know, where other projects have struggled when the public has had an opportunity to drill down and pick apart the financials. So I hope they they take the time. I mean, we've had 12 days already, but hopefully the public will continue to look at these critically and, you know, provide comments to us . I still have yet to hear a speaker at council opposed to this. So if you're out there, hopefully we don't hear someone come and say we need more time. You know, we haven't talked about this enough because there has been ample opportunity both at the planning board, other commissions and council, you know, to voice concerns. So I hope we don't we don't see a parade of people telling us that, because I think that's a little disingenuous after after all the hard work is that you have done and staff has done. So that's kind of my thoughts where we are right now. Thank you. And I appreciate the comments and the presentation. And I have received emails from people that are adamantly opposed to any housing, especially on because that would flow through the two. I think they are out there and I and and. I. Personally in regards to traffic, that is a big issue of mine. When I look at this, though, it's things that the prior counsel gave this exclusive negotiate an agreement to this company with the 800 homes, which means. I am looking for how the traffic will be addressed. I see this property as a gift to our meetings large. As much as I want jobs and to have something done at the point, I think that at the end this has to benefit all our meetings. A comprehensive transit has to be addressed. I'm concerned that, you know, I voted against hiring a consultant to look at that. I think we have to address this bus shuttle transit. And I know we have our business allies that have already said this sooner rather than later. The traffic through the tube is too much. This cannot within our ability, it cannot contribute any more to that. And yes, it does flow across the island all the way across the island. It is a serious problem. So how do you put an 800 homes and have it have as low impact as possible on our roads? And I think we have to be very mindful of that. And I'm not sure we're there. I'm just going to raise these issues and I'm hoping everyone can be thinking about this. How are we really doing this? Barry The ferry. Okay. I checked Richmond. They said their ferry was 42. They were just. That just happened 40 to 50 million. And that's on line is what they're estimating for their terminal. And we're talking about 10 million. I don't know what the deal is. And then we have our dredging costs of I feel like that is very immature unless in there's someone's got this information. What is the deal is we they're going to put in how much money. How much is the dredging? Is this 10 million going to make a difference? And then I'm going to ask this question of staff, how much parking is being said, set aside for the ferry right there by the ferry. How many spaces are there? 400 spaces. 400? Okay. How many cars do we think? Well, I'm going to compare that to Harbor Bay. Do you know how many spaces are there or how many? We have a big problem at the Harbor Bay Ferry right now. Do you have any idea how many spaces are there? I don't know. Do you know? Or the main street ferry? Do we know how many cars? Main Street? I think it's like 700. Okay. So if Main Street is 700 and this is 400, then that's significantly less. Than it is. But we're expecting a lot of people to actually live and walk to the ferry or ride their bikes to the ferry and other things. So we're while we're one of the reasons we're putting it in the seaplane lagoon, at the heart of the development is to try to get all the, you know, people moving there that want to take ferries so that they won't be driving. It doesn't mean the people. There. Will be people driving. And we don't I'm not saying that no one's going to drive at all. It's just that we're hoping to really maximize the the. Okay. So I like to I appreciate that. So I'd like to know how many parking spaces that Harbor Bay. And I know we've got an excess of cars that use that one and I. Appreciate their main street ferry terminals will be open to. Correct, but I am concerned about building a ferry that serves just this area. Why? Because when I look at the housing, I think we are not building what I want to call workforce housing. I think you've got below market rate and I think you have a majority of higher end and. And and this is at least $10 million. I, I think it's going to cost. I don't know what the deal is, where the rest of the money is going to come from. I don't think 10 million is going to cover it at all. So. But. Okay, the sports complex, what is the total cost for the sports complex? We're getting 5 million from this development. What's the rest of it? We have in the master infrastructure plan is $20 million. Okay. And where is that? Where's the other 15 million going to come from? From other phases of development. So when will that be? What's the time like before we actually have families that get to use the sports complex. Well, you mean when will we get the rest of the money first? Right. When is it going to be built? Because this is for our community. You're setting aside 5 million for something that I think truly will benefit our community at large. Mm hmm. And where's how. What's your timeline? I'm going to want to this one. On the red. It's going to depend on the timeline for the rest of the development that's really subject to the city council desire to dispose and develop plan. So. Okay. So if we don't have any estimate for that, then I sounds like we shouldn't be holding our breath for when we're going to actually get a sports complex. They may be putting up the $5 million, but we're not going to see anything. And. But if I may, similar to other park projects, it's also feasible to do things in stages, and we've talked about that with the sports complex. So for example, that's something I'm doing with Estuary Park will be doing phase one and phase two. Sweeney Park will be probably 4 to 5 phases. So it's not that we necessarily need to raise the entire. 20 million before we even begin building and opening to the public. So I will be looking for more information in regards to how we're going to have something that the public can use. I think that's very important. And and I see the sports complex, at least at this point. Do we know how many parking spaces and will be at the sports complex and what that really we have any idea about when we say sports complex, what that is? We've not done any detailed design on the sports complex. Okay. We have it'll depend on how many fields, what type of fields, what types of amenities. So there's it's it's really. 44 acres of blank space for us to work within at this point. Okay. So I think that our community does feel like we have a shortage of sports fields and that that is a big concern for our community. I don't know if our community at large thinks that we need actually, I have been talking to people about the theory and I thought a good comment that came up was we have a ferry at Harbor Bay and we already have one at the point, but we have nothing in the middle and that's actually a big part of where our residents live. So if we were pulling back and we were thinking where to serve Alameda and would we want a if we wanted another ferry, where would we want it to be? I'm not sure we would want it a mile, a mile and a half from an existing ferry. And I'm hoping that we can come up with. So so when I look at this, I'm thinking that this goes to our meetings. A large and the sports complex may very well be a better use of the money so that we actually get something. And I and I know there's. Apparently people that live in these homes. And, you know, we're trying to encourage people to ride their bikes all over, but to ask them to ride their bike a mile or a mile and a half, maybe out of the equation, that they need a ferry that they can just quickly ride their bikes to or watch. And I'm not sure that that's correct. Actually, I would submit that's not correct. So I'm not sure that that's really the need. Overall, workforce housing, there is a need for what I'm going to call housing for middle income people, whatever that is. I'm not sure that that is being addressed here, and that is a big issue in regards to whatever type of jobs are being put here. Is this the housing that will support those people, whatever if we're doing retail? And I would I would submit that they're not going to be able to afford most of this housing. So whatever I think, if possible, the jobs that are brought in should match a line with the housing because that will in fact reduce your traffic . If the we don't have to have people driving on and off of the island driving, they can work. I think that's ideal. We're looking for people that can work and live there. Okay. The percentage and the water issue, that's a big issue. But I appreciate the work that's been done on that because we all know we're in a drought and Allen meetings are being impacted by that. So that's that. I appreciate that work. The percentage of these homes that are being leased as opposed to by now, the comments in this report go to there hasn't been that much new rental housing built. But I've noticed what I think happens is that we have single family homes that are sold and then some people turn around and lease them. So they did not initially get put out to be leased. But that's what happens. And you have many if you look at Bayport, for instance, there are people there that are that are renting. It didn't start as a rental. But what is nice about that for a city is that when a Prop 13 benefits or for IT owners of property long term because they're they don't have a change they're able to have a corporation hold the rental property and they may change on people that are working there or whatnot. But over time they're still holding that corporation, still holding the property, which means the value is not being reassessed. That occurs when the property is sold and when an individual eyes a house, then they rent it out. Then then the property is going to have more turnover and that benefits our community. Time and the timing of the property long term in a long in a lease situation like that when we're talking about such a high percentage . That concerns me. And I and I disagree with the suggestion that you don't have new rentals just because you're not doing a rental apartment building. We have many people that rent homes and or we don't really have that many condos, but they rent homes. And in fact, I think we have overall higher percentage of rentals in our community compared to other communities in the Bay Area. And yet this is correct, and that we don't have that many apartment buildings, but we have lots of rentals regardless. Okay. The roads, what they're going to actually look like. I recently had the opportunity. Thank you to the bicycling enthusiasts to meet one of the mayors from Copenhagen who talked about how they do designing of roads and and they don't they don't actually don't do cycle tracks they try to do the same direction as the cars, but they do but they design it intentionally so that you have roads that accommodate your drivers as well as a lot of bicyclists and walk and people that are walking different modes of transportation. And I think that if someone can look at what they're doing, actually that's what this meeting was about. The many of a few of us had the opportunity, including staff. I think we have to be more focused on trying to make it work when we have our bicyclists and our walkers and our cars, cars sharing the same roads, senior housing that continues to come up, how will this housing accommodate seniors? And that also goes to universal housing. One thing I have noticed with tri level homes over by target is that the washer and dryer can be on the top floor, which and there'll be a room on the whatever floor you enter on if it's the first floor, the second floor. But I think it's important to have the washer and dryer on whatever the main floor is with that bedroom so that your person that is limit has limited mobility can actually exist on one floor of a tri level home, if that's what we're doing. Trial of a home's. Chuck routes I'd like to see and that may be in here exactly how our truck routes are going to be set up because we have that read a maintenance facility. Where the roads are going to be cutting across through this development if they're coming across this development at all. To get the field to the wheel building and hopefully they don't have to go through this housing development to get their. Okay. And when I looked at the overall chart, I think it was exhibit 11, which I appreciate. The single family homes, 125 of them, 850,000 was the number here. And this is beyond your development. But in regards to staff and it does connect to this development because 125 of the homes, single family, 850,000 townhomes, 300 800, 795,000. That's 425. But I'm going to call high end homes out of. 497 homes to buy their condos. 72 condos, 72 condos, 300 townhomes, 100,000, 72 condos or 540. Okay. That could be in the middle that I'm going to call middle, but that's only 72. You've got 425 that are 800,000 or higher. That's approximately 85% of what to buy is what I'm going to call high end or luxury overall. I don't think that's going to reflect our jobs. I don't think that reflects our community. I see that as a problem. The apartments. You've got 400, 526 apartments. That are not the low and very low, the low and very low apartments. I can understand and appreciate the comments that we need those to be apartments to provide the services and make it work, and then that benefits the people that are living there. I'm not sure that this division of. 425 high end. Homes. 72 condos, and then 526 apartments that are relatively expensive because we're not going to be able to we will not have rent control there ever. That will always be market rate per state. We would have to change something at the state level, which means that's a high percentage that we can't we can't control. Now, if we did moderate, if we did more condos change this up somehow, then I think you have a better chance of taking care of people. But then middle income, how many cars will actually be generated from this project? It's going to be a significant number. They will be driving through that tube. They will not all take the ferry. You take the ferry to get to San Francisco. You don't take the ferry to go to Oakland. Yes, some people will be riding their bike to Oakland, not currently through the tube there. Not not very many cars will be generated. Okay. To me, the only reason it makes sense to have to offset this traffic that I see is a big issue is if in fact we're addressing some of the issues that Alameda INS have and I'll and what I hear is Alameda instead of being pushed out of this town because they cannot afford to stay here which means this housing somehow has and seniors. Somehow I think that. Okay there's your balance. If the housing that we're producing will address the needs of our maidens or mere the jobs somehow so that we're not just ending up with housing for people that. Well are your high, high income families or individuals because that does not reflect Alameda. And when I hear about the ferry, I'm thinking that's your ferry that aligns with your high end housing. And then what about the people in the middle? How does this project help them? Those are my concerns. Yes. I think if I could just comment quickly in terms of the current housing scenario, I think the 5000 feet picture of as to why Joe Ernst and Company or even if you look at Bayport, why Bayport turned out the way it is. And, you know, you need to take a look at, for example. Ron Cowans Project Alpha at Harbor Bay Isle or when Dawn Parker started. Marina Village. You know, back in the seventies, these guys were rebuilding. I mean, Dawn Parker, when he put together Marina Villas, they were building basically on, you know, areas where there was really nothing . Marina Village was kind of a dump. What's it called? Harbor Bay was, you know, just kind of open land. It's like, you know, Bay, before we was a farm. I think the challenge for any developer, whether it's Joe Ernst or Catalist or whomever, when it comes Alameda point, is that this is important for the public to understand is that we're basically doing brownfield development. And what that means is that, you know, there's a certain amount of investment that's created that's required just to get to the gate, just to get the property to the to be developable state. So right off the bat, that almost doubles the cost of of of whatever project that you're involved in because it's not only laying down the infrastructure that's required to support development, but it's actually tearing out the awful stuff that's already there on the ground. And by virtue of that, you know, that doubles the cost. You're going in, you're tearing it out, and then you're going to put back, you know, things that that are needed. So in order to deal with kind of this brownfield development that, say, Ron Cowen didn't have to deal with over at Harvard or or Don Parker didn't have to deal with over at Marina Village. Don Parker, by the way, was our first R.A., our executive director. In order to deal with these on the revenue side, on the revenue generating side, you do have to have a certain program that does that does entail, you know, $800,000 homes, townhomes. I mean, those are expensive, no doubt. And I couldn't afford it. I mean, I'm glad I can afford what I have. But, you know, that's the challenge of doing Alameda point, of dealing with very real infrastructure related problems. And on top of that, dealing with the social issues that we as a city have decided to embrace. One of those social issues being the 25% set aside for affordable housing, for very low income people and low income people. And that by virtue of that, as the representative from Eaton Housing said, you know, the city of Alameda is making these decisions that have implications with regard to how you develop the rest of Alameda point to deal with these social cost issues, to deal with infrastructure cost issues, to deal with the transportation issues. So, you know, I understand, you know, a lot of people have concerns about housing and they want to see workforce, moderate income housing. I understand that. And I think we have in Joe Ernst and SRM and all the different partners. Sorry, I don't mean to just always say Mr. Ernst, but we do have people who are, you know, struggling mightily to to meet the objectives, the many varied objectives that we, as the residents have indicated that we want. But, you know, there's there's so much give that the project can take, can give. And and I think, you know, the effort that MBS art has done in putting together the staff and the and the Fiscal Impact Analysis Report indicates that, you know, this is a very tight project and we're at a late portion of this development process where it's very, very difficult to load on new objectives. You know, in terms of dealing with the rental housing crisis of right now, you know, I'm not going to oversell the argument. I'm not going to say just because you build more rental housing. Therefore, you know, as the typical market based approach says, you know, that the supply of rental housing and everything is going to be great, that, you know, equilibrium, market equilibrium is going to reach a certain point and suddenly housing be affordable once again. Maybe it won't work. Out like that. I mean, other people have different theories. The guy who does Case-Shiller, you know, he says, you know, sometimes the market doesn't work that way. So. I think we're doing a yeoman's effort here, not just SRM, but also all the people who brought us to this this point in dealing with the infrastructure cost related issues and dealing with the transportation issues. And by virtue of that, there are real life implications in terms of the program that that one we're putting together, that that type of housing. And at some point in time, we're going have to make a decision and finally move forward, because it's been 21 years now. And member Ashcroft. Thank you. And if I could just add, I appreciated Councilmember de Suggs remarks, and I think there's a temptation when we're creating this new project just for creating something out of nothing or a lot of, you know, really bad things that have been cleaned up and remediated and whatnot. And there is a tendency to want to solve all of our problems in one fell swoop with this this project. And we're not going to be able to do that for a number of reasons. Can we get closer to solving some of the problems and the issues before us and in contributing to this community? Sure. And that's where the recreational opportunities come in. And the transit dollars and I, I and I appreciated Mr. Aldrich's comments about we can phase parks. That's what she does for a living. She creates parks and she's seen that it doesn't all happen at once, but you can still create some in a recreational area. But if we don't do this at all, all of that is off the table. So, you know, we have to to weigh carefully what it is we we preserve and what it is we throw away if we decided not to go down this path. But I think we also shouldn't lose sight as a council of the kinds of solutions we can work closer toward right now. And for instance, we've talked a lot about affordable rents and, you know, people being priced out of this town because they can't afford their rents. I hope that soon the rental ordinance that we contemplated and was sent back for some tweaking, I hope that'll come back to us soon and I hope it will be passed unanimously by this council because I really feel bad for the folks who were hoping that we would have passed it back when it came to us before . But that's something we can make a dent in now, is to at least make sure that people are not being priced out of their home there, their rental units, without at least some fair hearing to to see whether or not that's a just increase and have some attempt at having their case heard. So there's some things we can actually do now that are right in front of us. There's some great things out there potential in the future. But we I agree. When Mr. De Sykes said we just have to resist the temptation to load on more and more expectations of this because I think we've loaded quite a bit on already. But anyway, I I'm really appreciative of every time this comes before us for an update, we've got more detail and it'll help us make that much more an informed decision next month. So thank you. Vice Mayor. One more comment. The negotiations are not over. I mean. The D-Day is in front of us. So I'm hoping that our input is being. I'm sure it is. It's being heard. And I think the mayor raised some points of basically stretching the envelope of what the mix would be. And we need to hear what comes back from that. I, I think I added some on trying to load risk of if in housing can't get their financing, we're still going to deliver the 128 units and we're not going to deliver it. I must I want to see what we can negotiate that the developer delivers it and that in that failsafe scenario. So I think these are all points that have to be carried back to the bargaining table and the the mix has to be stirred so that we can, again, get get this thing delivered, but delivered to fulfill a promise that is that it offers. So we are, as I understand, this comes back June 16th, right? Okay. Is this the last meeting before it comes back to us or will there be another meeting? I think this is the final meeting. Okay. So in regards to whether or not my council members think this is good or bad, I appreciate anyone that wants to weigh in and explain why you think it's a great idea. I tried to be very honest, but my concerns have been I've been raising these concerns for a long time, and I continue to think that we have to address more than the people at the below market and the people at the high. And that's all I'm doing is I'm putting it out there is at the end of the day, there needs to be four people that agree to this project. All right. Any other comments? So that's now number seven, City Manager Communications. Right. We have none. All right. Number eight. And we don't have any other public comment. We have number nine, council referrals. And number ten, council communication. Mr. Horn, remind the. Audience here. For the street bridge is closed. So trying to leave the island, you have to take alternative means. Thank you. All right. Appreciate that.

I would like to hear a staff report because I have a I just want to know a couple of questions on how those funds are being used for rapid rehousing and what that falls under under Measure H. Just briefly. Kelly Colby. So then through Measure H, we received approximately $1,000,000 for rapid rehousing. We went out for an RFP. And through the contracting process in that we were the the the winners from that RFP were Interval House and Lutheran Social Services. So Interval House received. $450,000 for rapid. Rehousing and Lutheran Social Services will receive 400,000. And then on top of that house will get $280,000 for prevention services. This is a complete expansion from what we were doing before. It's pretty amazing. I really appreciate you guys applying for the fund and using it this way. Thank you. Any public comments item? If that was you, please cast your vote.","Recommendation to authorize City Manager, or designee, to execute all necessary agreements, and any subsequent amendments, with Interval House and Lutheran Social Services of Southern California, to receive and expend Measure H funding in an estimated amount of $1,130,000, for the approximate period of July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, to provide rapid rehousing and homeless prevention services.

You know, you guys know our SEC. Madam Secretary is very fast on that. We get everyone. We just listen to people. Yes. All right. 11 eyes. Council Bill 71 is passed. Okay. Next up, councilman, clerk, will you please put Councilperson 52 on the floor? Jasmine's president I move that council bill 752 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and second it. Andrew Webb up. Can we hear the staff report? All right. Thank you again. Andrew Webb here from CPD. This is a request for rezoning of properties at 39, 55, 39, 65 and 3995 North High Street from Ibe you oh two to IMX three you owe to. This request is in Council District three. It's at the north edge of the Cole neighborhood. It's a little over three, three quarters of an acre at the intersection of 40th and high. Currently occupied by two industrial structures, the subject site zone or the surrounding zoning is also primarily ivy UO two, with some mixed use zoning to the south and a couple of planned unit developments. Andrew Scuse me real quick. Why don't you go black back one one slide. Absolutely. Another slide. Another slide. Okay. This is Council District nine. I just went, Oh, geez, I know. I don't want to get confused with a Lopez and. All council district three so bad. So let's let's just. I apologize for the misnomer there. This is indeed Council District nine. This is fine District nine. Everyone watching in at the OC. Go ahead. You can go back. Sorry to interrupt. You just wanted to be clear about that. Land users in the area are a are a fairly fine grained mix of industrial, commercial, multi and or single and multi-unit residential. And then of course to the north there on the north side of 40th over the A-line tracks, there is a major intermodal rail and trucking facility. Now, this aerial shows the subject site, along with an associated redevelopment site. They're kind of at the top of the of the frame. The subject site is proposed for rezoning to enable the construction of a parking garage that would serve redevelopment of this this collection of pre-war industrial structures. They're further west along 39th. This is a photograph or photographs of the subject site here. The first looking kind of southwest, a long high street and the one on the bottom, they're looking northwest along high. These photos are looking across High Street to the east. You can see that the development across the street includes residential, some industrial and some outdoor storage uses. These photos were taken at where the alley intersects 40th. So we're looking east at the back of the subject's site and then west toward the industrial use to the west of the site. So the existing zoning, as I mentioned, is I.B. with the quota or billboard overlay. I.B. is a is a high intensity industrial district and it does allow surface and structured parking. However, it requires fairly deep setbacks to the primary street, which in this case would be High Street. This photograph, this aerial shows the variation of setbacks in the area. As you can see, the structure at the north end of the subject site actually is built right up at the street. The structure on the south part of the site is set back about 30 feet. The applicant proposes this the IMX zone to allow full use of the site for this parking garage. So again, the IMX three, that is an industrial neighborhood context mixed use with a maximum height of three stories. The idea is to promote industrial mixed use, but in a pedestrian scaled environment with buildings up at the street, kind of shop front appearances and an active street level, it does allow the shallow front setbacks. It has high build to requirements and is generally accommodates a variety of commercial, civic and residential uses. Terms of the process to date. Informational notice did go out to all the Reno's counselors and other stakeholders on April 9th. Planning Board held a hearing on June 21st at which they recommended approval. The committee considered this request on July 11th and also recommended approval. There are quite a few registered neighborhood organizations that consider the subject site to be within their boundaries. All have received notices several times throughout the process. We have received one email from the whole neighborhood in support of this proposed rezoning. To approve a rezoning. As you know, the Council must find that the request meets these five criteria from the Denver zoning code. In terms of the first criteria with regard to consistency with adopted plans, there are five plans that impact the site comprehensive plan and Blueprint Denver and then also the River North Plan, the 30th and Blake Station Area Plan and the subsequent Hyde amendments that were adopted last year and the Elyria and Swansea Neighborhoods plans which abuts the area in terms of the comprehensive plan, the proposed IMX three district further several policies by increasing the feasibility of development on a smaller site in keeping with the existing fine grained mix of of uses in this area and small block sizes and furthers a mixed use redevelopment opportunities and support of nearby redevelopment of the nearby complex of of older industrial structures. The Blueprint Denver identifies this area as an area of change and highlights this particular site for mixed use. The River North Plan recommends a general transit oriented development and mixed use for this area, and this request is consistent with that. The 38th and Blake Station area plan does not technically impact this site, but it does impact the larger redevelopment site to the west. And for this area generally recommends a mix of uses the Elyria and Swansea. A neighborhood plan recommends a mixed uses in this area with a focus on employment, which is consistent with the IMX Zone District. With regard to the other criteria, the this request will result in the uniform application of building form, use and design regulations for the IMX three District Implements Plans for walkable, transit oriented development, thereby furthering public health, safety and welfare and staff agrees with the applicant's proposed justifying circumstance. As I'm sure you're all aware there, we've observed high levels of redevelopment and interest in this area. Redevelopment activity in this area intensified by the opening of the 30th and Blake Arcade Station and the efforts of the Arts District. And finally, staff finds this proposal is consistent with the surrounding industrial neighborhood context. So with that, CPD recommends approval based on the finding that all these criteria have been met. And I'm happy to answer any questions. All right. Thank you, Andrew. We have five speakers for this bill. I'm going to ask all five speakers to come up to the front. You have 3 minutes each. Bruce O'Donnell, John McIntyre, Brett Parmalee, Trina Moyer and Sekou. Bruce O'Donohue a first. Good evening, Mr. President, and members of council. My name is Bruce O'Donnell, and I'm at 770 Sherman Street here in Denver. And earlier this evening, this document was passed out to each of you. And I thought it might be helpful to give it some context to this rezoning request. In addition to what was provided in the staff report immediately west of this site is a nine acre adaptive reuse of a former industrial site, and to reuse these grade old brick buildings that have significant architecture and will be rhino's next hot spot. We need to be able to create a parking reservoir because that's the way to preserve the buildings and reuse the site. And so the purpose of this rezoning is to set up a parking reservoir for phase one of the redevelopment of the Denver Rock Trail property. And we're proposing I am x three, which would allow approximately 400 stall parking structure to be built on the site. It will comply with all of the requirements in the IMX zoning to include the possibility of activating the ground floor, special design and screening and transparency on the on the ground floor. And in fact, the parking garage is going through SDP review right now in the planning department. So that's kind of the context for this rezoning request. And members of the design team and the ownership team and I are all here tonight in available to answer any questions. Should you have any. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell. John McIntyre. If you would, all of the folks that I call if you make your way up here. So here's a little time. Go ahead. John McIntyre with Tribe Tactics, 1759 Dahlia. Street hit answer any questions? Great. Thank you, Brett Parmalee. Brett Parmalee, 1302 South Vine with Saunders Construction here to answer any questions. Great. Thank you. Trina Moyer. Hello. I'm Trina Moyer. I'm a resident of Denver, and I'm here representing the whole neighborhood. As the vice president of the Neighborhood Association Board, we are in support of the rezoning of the properties located on North High Street in order that a parking structure can be built near the Rock Creek Rock Drill Development site if reasonably priced parking is made available. We believe that this will reduce the number of patrons parking elsewhere within coal, thereby keeping most of the on street parking available for all residents. The new zoning would also allow for possible ground street. Activation of the. Parking structure, which is preferred by the Coal Neighborhood Association. I also would like to express our appreciation to rock drill, for their willingness to engage. Us and the coal residents in their process. And we look forward to. Continued communications and collaboration. Thank. Great. Thank you. All right. So who? Oh Masuku as before, same organization went to three ABC. Okay. Continue on a dialog. Same thing, different location. But I didn't get it. You went. Why don't you hit something? Going to try it another way? Because what we're going to do is we're going to document the records, so. We're talking about congruent. See in It's Only Change and we're talking about making sure that it's like other pieces of property in the area. And so we want to really work on confusing this thing because we want to get people so caught up in the details of things that you missed the forest for the tree. Now I've been to them community meetings. Let me tell you how it works. Powerful people come in with a paradigm framework. And they tell the people flat out this is going to happen. It's going to happen. What do you want to happen or not? Because there are powerful people doing powerful things and we are all a city council already lined up for like the last 13 zip. People are now afraid that if they don't put an input into that is congruent to the paradigm, they will have no no input. So they operating out of fear. Well, if we don't go along with the program and we don't get none. And if they keep it going where they keep it going, then, you know, somebody's going to get in trouble because they oppose this. And you know how they do things. Now, historically, local governments were involved in the rezoning of Jewish people in Nazi Germany to put them into concentration camps. Same justification, always going to be found and abuse and everything, and then end up engaged in a world war that killed millions of people. And the rescue of humanity. Yeah. Yeah. And then because of that, there is a United Nations resolution on human rights violations that include genocide, gentrification and ethnic cleansing. The guy in Yugoslavia, he was doing life imprisonment and they have hung folks for that because it requires the requirement death penalty. Hmm. Imprisonment for life and enormous fines. Now, imagine this. That's filed in the United Nations under. As a focal point. Then all of a sudden, watch tourism drop. Watch economic development drop. And you know as well as I know, I've been here long enough to see this boom bust thing with you real estate, because it's unplanned. You got a misses cycle plan. Missed cycle didn't include marijuana. This was 10,000 people coming here every month. And where they're going to live must cycle and. Displace the local population. All right. You can have a seat. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah. Wow. Well, that concludes our speakers questions for members of council. I have a question for you, Andrew. So we had one person in our position on the on the planning board. Do you did you do you remember what the issue was there? Yes, Mr. President. The issue was the retention of the oh two billboard overlay. That's right. Okay. And. I mean, did they talk a little bit more about that or. I believe the commissioner's stance was that is this area redeveloped into more of a of a people oriented place with, you know, they're kind of the transit oriented development that's coming along with the 38 and Blake Station area plan that he didn't feel that billboard uses were remained appropriate for the area. Okay. So we have the 38th new question. We have the 30th and Blake design overlay, which you were actually a part of and working on. So do these specific properties fall within the design overlay? Yes, Mr. President. You know, I neglected to mention that during our presentation, but the the the recommended height here is consistent or the proposed height here of three stories is consistent with the base height recommendation of the 38th and Blake stationary, a plan height amendments which did include this area. Okay. And they call for activation of ground floor. Call for ground floor uses as as one of the is Trina moya from the neighborhood said so I guess what I'm trying to get to is and maybe someone from you know the owner's representative team can answer this. Is there a plan to activate the ground floor for the for the parking structure? And I'll let them speak to that. But I would say generally that the IMX three zone also does have some requirements for ground level activation entrances, transparency, that sort of thing. But right. I'll pass on to Mike to the development team here. Great. I can respond to that. John McIntyre with the architects. The, um, the parking structure that's being. Proposed currently is being designed to meet the IMX requirements for transparency. And street. Edge activation. It is also being designed for future conversion with flat four. Uses and the appropriate floor to ceiling. Heights should it need to be converted to full active ground use under the design overlay when it comes in. So it's being designed to meet the current requirements of mix with allowance, to fulfill the requirements of the. Design overlay. In terms of floor to ceiling. Clearance as a ground floor, height and flat levels and at the beach. Okay. And for the owners, is there a commitment to do it or are we still just talking about conception at this point? We're still talking about conception at this point. I think the there's a need and a requirement for us to meet all the requirements of the IMX zoning until we fully understand the design overlay. Requirements and those are issued. Legally. All right, Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. Andrew, can you help me understand why we are doing parking for a project that's on a different block and that development is not providing its own parking. I mean, it may have some of its own parking, but why throw allowing an offsite parking structure for a different development that's not even adjacent? Councilmember Ortega, going back to the aerial here, hopefully you can see it on screen. Yeah, I'm real familiar with the site. The the sites are actually owned. They're under the same ownership. Okay. And and I believe the same development team is working on both projects. But the as you can see there, the rock drill site itself is fairly dense with prewar brick structures. While the while the subject site here is probably, I would say, 1950s to sixties, more modest industrial structures. And I think the idea is, is rather than to create the space on the rock drill site for for parking by tearing down some of those more historic structures is to use this space right nearby to to provide that parking and preserve some of the the unique architecture on the rock drill site. And. In. Councilwoman along along with that and correct me if I'm wrong here, this is the 39th Street, the channel that's coming coming through there. And they will be taking some of what could be used for parking some of the parking locations right there along 39th as well for this. Mr. President, that that is correct. That that project will run along 39th Street there, including the parcels that you see to the south that are currently being used for storage. So some of the it's not I'm not sure exactly how it will impact the parking, but it could be expected that parking will change. So I had another question. So basically what? I would like to know from Mr. O'Donnell is. Yes, I was just looking at the the PowerPoint, and it showed some schematics that look like we're not preserving that property. It would be a whole new development on that nine acre site. Can you correct me if if I'm saying that wrong? Yes. Also, if I could go back to your parking question for just a moment. We have also acquired property between High and William Street in. So there's a direct pedestrian connection from the park, the proposed parking structure site straight into the heart of the rock drill site on the west side of William Street. And so there is an easy pedestrian connection there. Okay. So is and I know the other property is not what we're dealing with tonight, but because it is already tied together via this application. Has that property been re zoned or is that a different project that's yet to come before this council? It is a different project. It is also zoned I.A. today. And as Triber architects explained a moment ago, we're waiting for the design overlay in in all of the 38 Blake Hyde amendments work to get work its way through and become adopted before we take any next steps. Okay. So is it anticipated that you would. The developer would utilize or the landowner, whichever is going to be doing the actual development is going to keep those buildings or actually level that and put in entirely new. So the intent and I'm going to use some approximations here right now, but I would estimate that about 60% of the site is built out with beautiful old red brick with classic architecture, old industrial architecture. In the intent is to preserve all of that and have this anchor of this be an adaptive reuse of those existing structures . Okay. And then about 40% of the structures there are of cinder block in in kind of 1960s, finest in. So the newer, taller buildings that that are in the plan right now would replace some of that. That isn't as architecturally significant. So in the newer, taller buildings, is it anticipated that given the fact that you have nine acres, that that site will provide some of its own parking? Yes. Okay. All right. And. So the people who own that property now, are they the actual applicant or is it someone else who, you know, is trying to purchase the land that's that's rezoning this today? So the property owners are the actual applicant and they're in a joint venture with Saunders development to pursue this whole plan. Great. I have no further questions. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. All right, Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Bruce. Yes, sir. Might as well just stand there. I remember going through the complex there, rock drill complex a few years back and was told that there on that site there are about 76 or 77 separate structures that grew over the years when that was an industrial complex and. With the if the ability to put the offsite parking garage is is granted through this rezoning, how many structures that otherwise might have to come down to satisfy parking requirements? How many of those structures would remain if you know. We'll put our heads together here. I think we can. Thank you. In other words, how many how many buildings of historical value might we actually be re using by allowing this off off site parking you? That number of existing buildings isn't as high as 70, but there is a. Number of very small buildings. Including those we. Are looking at retaining. 18 large. Historic structures. So the predominantly brick masonry to through structures as well as some of the more interesting manufacturing buildings that are located along 40th, which is the vast majority of the historically significant buildings, was only one building from earlier that we're looking at the potential of taking apart and reassembling because it was built between two more historically significant buildings. The balance of those are buildings that would be taken down are 1950s metal sheets. Right. Okay. Does that does the the buildings that would be retained on the 40th, does that include the one that has the the railroad siding that goes through there? Yeah, we're looking to retain both the. Spurs and all of the and increase the lines and courtyards within this one. Okay. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Espinosa. A question on the euro to. I'm looking at chapter 59. How was that? That was called you oh two in chapter 59, wasn't it. Or what was it called in chapter 59. But Councilmember Espinosa, I will have to get back to you on that. I'm not sure if that if that, you know, to overlay nomenclature was a carryover from former Chapter 59 or if that was in the current zoning code. But it it is it is an overlay zone in the overlay section of of the current zoning code. And it is the billboard overlay. That somebody from CPD or the city attorney. How is the year or two mapped in 2010? Thank you, Councilman Espinosa, Nate Lucero, Assistant City Attorney. When the city resumed in 2010, the UO two overlay, which is the billboard use overlay, was mapped everywhere where it was. Presently allowed at that time. And so the properties that were already entitled with the billboard use retained that. Use through the. You oh to. So would that have been so this was for this is currently I b was that a use that was allowed in i b and therefore it got you go to add it on even though it didn't go into a new zone district. Andrew Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the B is a Denver zoning code zone district, is that right? So in 2010 when that property was re zoned, it was rezone to I.B.M. to. Well, because we didn't actually have eyes on districts in the prior. What would that have? Well, we did. We had i0i1 and I to. Okay. So that would have been on a billboard use would have been allowed in the I zero. I wonder I to. I believe that is correct, yes. So there are five one, two, three, four, five, five different adopted plans that relate to this. Do any of them speak to signage and billboards? I would have to confirm that. But having read through all of those several times, I'm not aware of any of them really addressing specifically the issue of of off premise signage. The reason I ask is having been through a steering committee and their neighborhood planning process. We have billboards on federal, but we never actually that sort of subject never came off. And so do we have a sort of weakness in our process whereby we don't actually have a mechanism to address whether billboards are, in fact, appropriate going forward or not? Because I get that the former I's zone districts in Chapter 59 allowed them. But when we move from a in a high zoned district into our most flexible zone district, which is IMAX, which could be 100% residential, it could be 30% industrial, could it be 100% commercial? We're talking about different animal. And if we're not having the conversation about signage during a planning process or during a rezoning, you know, when do we have it? And so I think it's it's relevant. I mean, I'm glad that somebody from Planning Board raised the issue because instead of suddenly realizing that there's a sort of weakness in our process about when do when do we start having that conversation? Obviously, we've we've run into this problem when we went to LED signage and things like that. But so I guess I would like from CPD if you could get back to me on what, if any, of our current neighborhood plans address signage going forward and if we have that as sort of our NPI process where we're talking about overhead signage because they're just this layer of of things that apply to various parts of the city that should be discussed and we should have direction when it when these things come to us. So thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman, do. I think it was Bruce s question about your handout, please? I want to talk about the picture, the vision and master plan. This is a very impressive picture. And can you I don't know if you've got a copy of it. Can you describe where this parking garage is and the other two buildings that are in this development? It's a very impressive looking, complete plan here. And I just want to make sure I in my mind, I know what are old buildings destroyed was brand new where this parking garage is. Yes, sir. Councilman, do the the page that is entitled Vision and Master Plan two. In the far right of that image, there's a light blue structure in that is the proposed parking structure. In it has a high street address. But but there's a connection straight into the heart of the bigger site across William Street, Mid-Block. Oh. Okay. Are we. Let's make sure we're looking at the same picture. No, no. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm looking at this picture. So that in that picture, the parking structure is in the bottom left corner. Okay. So first. Yes, this is the picture, correct? Yes, sir. So in the bottom left corner, there's an image of the parking structure and it's illuminated. Is there a way to. Thank. Yeah. You don't have that picture. So in the picture that you all have in front of you this evening, in the handout, there's an illustrative that's at night with all of these buildings illuminated in the parking structure is in the bottom left corner and it in it actually says Denver rock drill on it in that image. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Can you describe? Are these all your buildings going off to to the right there? Is this your entire plan? Yes, it is. Okay. Can you just give us just for education, can you explain what the future. Sure. So that right now the vision for the development program is that the generally single storey, historic redbrick structures would be reused for a lot of open office type uses and also retail, restaurant entertainment and recreation type uses. There's the taller buildings too, that further to the right are more futuristic at this point. But we're in discussions with the hotel company to perhaps do a hotel there and then some taller mixed use buildings in. Part of the idea, obviously, is to take advantage of the proximity to the 30th and Blake Rail Station. And I'm sure that some of those buildings will have its own parking like this parking garage is not going to satisfy the needs of that entire future. That's correct. That the the new buildings, the multistory new buildings would self park in in this parking reservoir would be available for visitors and tenants in the primarily in the red brick buildings where the there's a tradeoff. If we want to preserve and re-use those buildings, we need to find a parking solution. And it looks like some mixed use. Additional residential as well. Possibly. Yes. Very impressive image. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Let's go to Councilman Flynn. Back up. Thank you, Mr. President. When Councilman Espinosa was asking about the use overlay, he prompted a few questions that I had intended to ask, but kind of dismissed. So maybe, Bruce, I could ask you, are you intending to use billboards to bring billboards onto the site? And that's why you want to preserve this? Not at this time, no, sir. But you just want to preserve the right because it's there now. Generally, yes. So the this overlay, in order for a billboard to in order for a new billboard to appear anywhere in the city of Denver where this overlay is in place, a billboard somewhere else in the city would have to go away. Mm hmm. And that's the only way a new billboard could come here. Okay. And so the thinking is, is that it's a property, right? That that maybe someday could be of some value, in particular with the line running adjacent to this site. But there is no plan. There's no activity in in in a billboard somewhere else in the city would have to go away for anything to happen here. And, Mr. President, the reason I came back in after Councilman Espinosa was I was searching the other IMX zones in the areas, particularly along Walnut and Larimer and along Brighton Boulevard and all of the I Amex parcels there also have the billboard overlay as part of their zoning. So it's not an unusual thing. But would it allow, Andrew, would the billboard overlay allow the type of signage that we see, say, at the Convention Center, the lighted LED signs that advertise third party businesses or events or things like that? Councilman Nu Generally, yes, the bill overlay does have those location restrictions. It does have that. It does require the cap and trade program, but it would allow the the advertisement for off of off site services or or products. And would it need some special additional approval to do animated or variable messaging signs, billboards? My apologies. Without the without the the the Denver zoning code right in front of me, I can't answer that, but I will certainly circle back to you. Or perhaps I think the answer is yes. Councilman Flynn, at this point in time, the Denver zoning code does not allow billboards to be animated or illuminated. There are a couple that were grandfathered in 2010, but at this time, billboards are not allowed to be on billboards. That's all. All right. Thank you. All right, Councilman Espinosa, back up. I would be in support of them moving the one that's next to the student housing on Colfax. I mean, literally right outside the windows over to the side. The question I have, because everybody who comes in speaks, has to sort of mention who they are and most stay where they live. Mr. Donald, can you tell me who the principals are for? 3939 Williams Building Corp.. Yes, the principles are the Weiss family, and they're Denver residents and business people in they've owned this site, I believe, since 1993. And they operate a business there. They operate their business there today and are in the process of relocating that business to accommodate the adaptive reuse of the site. Okay. Yeah, it's all right. This is there are so many layers between us and who's really making the ask. I just would like to know. So thank you. All right. Thank you. This concludes our questions. Now close counsel Bill 752 Comments. Members of council. This is again in my district. There are multiple things happening in this area right here. Full disclosure, I live down the street from this site. I think you got a you got a very active neighborhood. And you guys had to reach out to a lot of individuals, some of which aren't even close to this site, which. Again. Let's work on that. On our notification for neighborhoods, on some of these things. You probably didn't even receive a response from some of these neighbors, but the whole neighborhood is embedded right in this site. And rhino arts is is really close, close by. I'm going to be supporting it. This is something that I think, you know, again, it it it is on on par with the guidelines and consistent with what our plans are. And so I'll be supporting this. Other. I keep my screen just one out. Okay. No other comments. It's been more than a second reminder of Secretary Rocha. Black eye. Clark Espinosa. I. Flynn. I Gilmore. I cash in. Can eat. I. Lopez. I knew. Ortega. I. Sesan. Mr. President. I police those voting against the results. The sorry, councilor. 11 eyes. 11 eyes. Constable 752 has passed. Councilman. Clerk, will you please put up Council Bill 750 on the floor?","A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 3955, 3965 and 3995 North High Street in Cole. Rezones property at 3955, 3965, and 3995 North High Street from I-B, UO-2 to I-MX-3, UO-2 (industrial to industrial, mixed-use) in Council District 9. The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 7-11-17.","Here is a focused professional summary of the key points from the presentation:

Main Objective:
Rezone properties at 3955, 3965, and 3995 N. High St. from I-B U-O2 (Industrial with Billboard Overlay) to I-MX-3 U-O2 (Industrial Mixed-Use 3 stories with Billboard Overlay) to allow construction of a parking garage serving a larger redevelopment project at the nearby Denver Rock Drill site.

Proposed Initiative:
- Build a 3-story, approximately 400-stall parking garage on the rezoned site per I-MX-3 standards (ground floor activation, design, etc.)
- Parking garage will provide parking for adaptive reuse of historic industrial buildings at the 9-acre Denver Rock Drill site
- Preserves significant historic architecture by avoiding demolition for on-site parking at Rock Drill
- Part of larger redevelopment vision mixing offices, retail, hotels, residential near 38th & Blake Station

Reasoning:
- Site is owned by same property owners redeveloping the larger Rock Drill site 
- I-MX-3 allows parking structures built up to the street, activating the public realm
- Consistent with adopted plans calling for transit-oriented, mixed-use development in the area
- Parking reservoir allows reuse of historic industrial buildings at Rock Drill instead of demolition
- Allows structured parking screened from street instead of surface lots

Context:
- In RiNo neighborhood seeing significant redevelopment interest near rail station
- Surrounded by mix of industrial, commercial, and residential uses already  
- Area plans recommend mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly development aligned with rezoning
- Coal Neighborhood Association supports rezoning if parking is reasonably priced
- One resident raised concerns about displacement, gentrification, and billboards",0.845,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly by reasoning freely about the core message, flow of ideas, and underlying context first.

It just goes to show how much support we have behind our efforts. Yeah. Oh, and this is day. Is. This is forward planning. So as you know, our association is a member of Sister City International. All right. Oh, thank. You. And what we do is we facilitate the. We facilitate and organize sister city activities for the city of Alameda. We have actually been a nonprofit organization for the last five years as well, so it helps for our mission. And our mission statement is as such. It is our goal to create relationships based on cultural, educational, economic and informational exchanges that foster lifelong relationships, to provide prosperity and peace through person to person diplomacy. Moving forward as president, I envision adding several community. Chairs. To head their own community. Scuse me. Had their own committee. As local residents who will identify cities across the globe to establish new sister city relationships. I would also like to take this opportunity to invite each and every council member to join our association and think about a sister city in a country not so far away that you'd like to foster a relationship with. These are our current sister cities. So Jan Ying Sister City, who Alex Chen is actually the committee chair for. That is a very active sister city. We also get invited to their conferences every year where a small delegation from here gets hosted along with many others from around the country. Unfortunately, a reader Japan and a lending girl from Sweden are not active. We are in communication with the Consul General of Japan to move forward with either a visa or identify another city in Japan. The Jimmy Getty. Program is going to be headed up by Cynthia Bonta, and you will hear from her in just a few moments . This is exactly where Janning is. And the reason why I'm showing that is because. This next one. There's a slide of how our delegation to China was greeted and how excited this sister city relationship was for the Chinese people as well as the people of Alameda. So we have a picture of our delegates presenting a gift to the Jennings city officials. This one is Mayor Johnson shaking hands with the mayor of Jenin city. That is in that city. Excuse me. This took place in. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And with that, I would like to introduce Cynthia Barton, who is going to give you a little bit more information about what is going on with Dumaguete and where we're going to go next. Thank you. I'm really very proud to be the US aska Alameda Sister City Association chairperson where the Alameda Dumaguete is sister city to be. We hope that's going to happen in June. This is a slide show of a slide of the map and you can tell that the magenta is in the eye. In the province of Negros Oriental, which is in the. Island of Negroes. So Negroes has Oriental and Occidental. Dumaguete Magenta is located at the southern eastern tip of Negros Island with a population of 104,167. 20,000 of that are students and they consider is the source of their economic growth. Dumaguete there. The name was coined from the Vizzion word nugget, which means to snatch. So Daggett is the root word, dumaguete is the action word, and it became dumaguete there as the name too applied to the city to in order to show that the city does have the power to attract and keep her visitors. That's why it snatched me. And hopefully they will snatch you too, so that Dumaguete can be a really attractive sister city for Alameda. Dumaguete is the Capital Principal Seaport and largest city in the Philippine province of Negros Oriental, known as the City of Gentle People. It was named one of the most ideal places in the world to visit, considering climate, cost of living, crime rate, existing expatriate community and healthcare. Now beach resorts, world class dove sites and dolphin and whale watching are a few of the tourist attractions. So do I. Move this? Oh. Okay. This is downtown Dumaguete there and you will see that there is some Spanish history. That tower over there is really the symbol of the city. Actually, that was the picture on the gift that Mayor Sagar Barea presented to the city of Alameda when I got back last June, 2013. Around September. And you will see that there is a church there. The Philippines is 85% Roman Catholic, and almost all cities have a cathedral of some kind. And those little object transportation vehicles are called tricycles. The very creative Filipinos transformed their bikes into little tricycles so that they can have a livelihood of transporting people from one place to another. But do we get the likes to be promoted as an investment destination for commerce to resume and business process outsourcing? Presently there are centers for tele tech SBI Eventers and qualified one. I don't know if you know what those tech companies are, but they're in dumaguete there. It's known to be the largest call center in the in the world or Asia. So that's. When I visited and delivered personally a letter from the Alameda City mayor at that time, Marie Gilmore, we brought a gift to symbolize our good faith and goodwill, and I was presenting it to Manuel Tavis to Gabriela, the Mayor of Dumaguete that. So that was two years ago. So we are now preparing to host a delegation. From our Philippines sister city to be them to get there in June, possibly from the fourth to the eighth in hours. It right here. The main purpose of the diplomatic visit is to formalize the sister city relationship between the two cities, with the two mayors signing a memorandum of understanding. Sister cities create relationships based on cultural, educational information and trade exchanges, creating lifelong friendships that provide prosperity and peace through person to person citizen diplomacy. The next slide. Tells us what we've done. Okay. There was an interest expressed by both mayors and the mayors exchanged greetings, which was made public during the celebration of Philippine National Day event in 2014, last year in June. And right now, we're having ongoing communications between our contacts in Dumaguete and us to plan for the program so that that program might somehow be reflected in the memorandum memorandum of understanding. So to to come. Is a city of Alameda resolution. We're hopeful that that will come about because you do have to approve the idea of alameda and dumaguete becoming sister cities. And that resolution will also be sent to the monks at their. And now. We have been thinking very hard about what our approach would be in this. Alameda, Dumaguete is sister city partnership and the whole board of directors has been pretty strong and unanimous in their wish that the exchange will be mainly educational and that this educational exchange occur in different levels with the youth level a very important element and with the potential of having even faculty exchanges between Silliman University, which is in Dumaguete this city. This is an American founded university that is recognized in the United States. It up its structure is adopts a lot of the American style education. So it's now considered pretty international because they have exchange students all over the globe in different continents. So we want that to happen, especially for our young people here, so that there can be this mutual exchange for mutual understanding and peace. Be starting with the young people. So we have a very ambitious itinerary for the four days. We will keep you updated on that because we're still firming them up and. We also have already initiated conversations between the Peralta Community College's International Studies Office and Silliman University president. He will be coming with his delegation, and we will have an opportunity to actually talk to him about the different options that he would like to offer us as far as educational exchange. So I think we really ought to pride ourselves in the diversity of our city. To think that our first sister city is between China, brought about by our Chinese-American community and our second active sister city will be between the Filipino-American community here and, of course, the broader community of Alameda and the Philippines. These two are the largest immigrant immigrant communities here in Dumaguete. And no wonder. So it would be really exciting to provide the international character of our relationships right here in in in Alameda. I really foresee that in the future, if we continue to have sister cities with different countries, that we can actually have an international youth conference here where they can exchange ideas about what issues they face as young people and maybe even as young people address international issues. So that's our presentation. And we want to close by inviting. All to our first fundraiser at Dragon Rouge, May four. This is an opportunity to get updates and also to help defray the hosting expenses, which is quite overwhelming. But we can do it. Thank you very much. I guess we can welcome questions. I don't know a few. Thank you. The member comments or questions? Member, Desai. I'll just offer a comment. Thank you very much to Ms.. Bonta and also to Karen Fong for the presentation tonight and the hard work that you've done putting this together over the many months. I think also a hearty thank you should go out to former council member Stuart Santa, who was very instrumental in putting this together. This sounds like very exciting. I look forward to June. Thank you. Remember, Audie. Also want to say thank you for all the hard work. You know, it's it's about time that we do have a sister city relationship with with a city in the Philippines. The state of California, you know, 1.5 million people that live in California are Filipino Americans. It's the largest API group in the state of California. And, you know, we've been blessed to have three Filipino American Council members, Councilmember de Saag, Councilmember Chen. Councilmember Bonta, who's now the first Filipino elected ever in the history of the state of California to the state assembly. So I think this is a real good thing to commemorate the heritage of our Filipino Americans and Alameda. And I also want to thank Cynthia and our vice mayor, who is in charge of this program for a very long time, and also our former council member, Stuart Chen, for all of his hard work on this. I remember Commons. Well, we have had sister city relations for a long time because when I saw letting go Sweden on the on the list when I was a student at Edison School a long time ago, we all had pen pals and letting go. So I guess that's kind of fallen by the wayside, but it's good to refresh with some current choices. So thank you all for your hard work and really nice to see you. Young people, the students in the audience. I know you got your homework done before you came, so thank you for coming to. I just I just want to say thank you for, for that presentation and thanks to the council for, uh, in most attention and lending work. And I also want to join in thanking all of you that are here this evening on this item. And I have a question. You had mentioned, Ms.. Fong, in regards to Japan that you're trying to get a substitute city in Japan. And I'm curious, in regards to Sweden, if there's efforts to find another community within Sweden, since it appears that we no longer have an active relationship. I actually have a relationship with the consul general of Japan and for another, a community involvement that I am with. But we have not made any contact with Sweden yet as of now. So if there's anyone that in our community that's interested in assisting with, you. Know, yes, quite frankly, we're a small organization and we're just now getting our feet going. So it's definitely in the works. We do. We definitely do want to establish reestablished communication with Sweden. I am back up here at the microphone and I really want it to just open it up to everybody in the chambers. Right now. If anybody is interested in joining Almeida's Sister City Association, please let us know. And we have some brochures out on the table out front and you know, you can join a committee or you can head a committee on your own if you'd like to. So we'd like to entertain that. And just just for the record, I was just reminiscing. It was a lot of years ago when I was at Edison School. And I think I'm given the way our population has shifted in the current demographics, I think it's perfectly appropriate to have the sister city relationships that we have and that, you know, it takes energy, a lot of energy to put these committees together. So I would really support just starting with what you're doing and and growing from there. Well, it really takes effort to put the committees together. It actually takes even more effort to keep them going. We don't want to we don't want, you know, situations like a Rita and then to go away, I mean, to happen again. It's just that's just not what we're about. Does it make sense to establish these relationships and then, oops, let them die? It's kind of like friendships, you know, we want to you want to foster those relationships and keep them going forever and ever time. Yeah, thank you. Q Item agenda item four. We do have a speaker under oral communication. Jim Hager. Good evening, Mayor, fellow council members. My name is Jim Hager. I live on Randall Road across the lagoon from the veer off campus. And I'm here to try and educate people. On the use loss. Nuisance lighting. I'm going to pass around two sets of pictures. The top picture here. Was taken at the other end of the lagoon. Where there was no nuisance lighting. The picture showing the houses very clearly was taken with a pocket digital and not a cheap one. But a good one. But not a great one. Taken. Why the light coming from the chiefs over lighting. The second picture. The bottom one was taken from my living room, the top one from my bed. No. I think we need a little more planning in our.","Presentation on the Alameda Sister City Association Dumaguete, Philippines Sister City Plan.  (City Manager 2210)","Here is a focused professional summary of the key points from the presentation:

The Alameda Sister City Association facilitates international sister city relationships for cultural, educational, economic and interpersonal exchanges to foster peace and prosperity. Their active sister cities are Janing, China and their priority is establishing a new partnership with Dumaguete, Philippines. 

A delegation from Dumaguete is expected to visit Alameda in June 2023 to formalize the sister city relationship through a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the mayors. Dumaguete is known as the ""City of Gentle People"" and has opportunities for educational exchanges with its American-founded Silliman University.

The association envisions the Dumaguete partnership focusing heavily on educational and youth exchanges to promote mutual understanding starting at a young age. Plans include potential faculty exchanges with Silliman University and the Peralta Community Colleges. Long-term goals are hosting an international youth conference in Alameda.

The sister city efforts reflect Alameda's diversity, with Janing connecting the Chinese-American community and Dumaguete linking the large Filipino-American population. Establishing relationships across cultures through person-to-person citizen diplomacy is a core mission.

Funding is needed to host the upcoming Dumaguete delegation, so a fundraiser is planned for May 4th. The association invited all community members to get involved by joining committees or proposing future sister city partnerships.",0.8550000000000001,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly by reasoning freely about the core message, flow of ideas, and underlying context first.

The Report of the City Council Agenda and three Resolution 318 41 requesting reports from the Seattle Department of Transportation and the Department of Construction Inspections and the Seattle Center identifying transportation projects in the vicinity of the Seattle Center Arena area, excuse me, and describing the process for administering the Seattle Center Arena Transportation Management Plan. Councilmember Johnson. Thanks. So we have had several conversations about the transactional documents, and this resolution has something to do with the transactional documents, but is really more off to the side about the city process as we contemplate the construction of a renewed key arena. I think it's really important that we think about how people get to and from that arena and the ways that we would build a transportation infrastructure to get people in, particularly people who are not driving alone to the arena. So this resolution responds to concerns that we've heard from community about the various different transportation projects that are planned for the neighborhood, which funding stream is going to be used to pay for those projects, and how the Department of Construction and Inspections, Department of Transportation, Seattle Center and other various departments are coordinating the completion of those projects . It asks for some reporting back on the status of the construction of those projects and the funding associated with them, and ask those reports to be given back to the council twice a year starting in June of 2019. Two other points that I'd like to say before. I know we've got an amendment on this topic. You know, the city does have a set of goals and objectives we want the arena to achieve in terms of how many folks are driving to the arena versus carpooling, walking, biking, taking transit. And we've got those same objectives for folks that are working at the arena as well and the folks who are working in the construction. So this is a complicated way of saying we've got a set of goals and objectives. We want to have the city work with the arena, focus on meeting those goals and objectives. And we want to hold ourselves accountable to make sure we build those projects on a on a correct timeline. So with that, when I stop there, we'll talk about amendments and then we'll we'll get the thing in front of us. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. We'll walk through them. Councilmember O'Brien, did you want to reserve your comments to the amendment part or would you like to say anything now? We'll wait for the amendments. Okay. So, Councilor and Justin, I have you scheduled for a first day, probably a substituted version. So I think what I'm supposed to do here is move to pass resolution 31841. Stephanie and I and I don't think we have a substitute. I think. Okay, very good. I think we now just have done. So is been moved in second of the pass a resolution is stated so. And and now we're down. To a substitute. And I don't have that language in front of me. And there is is a substitute version for. Seven, eight, four, three, eight, I believe. Okay. So would you like to move seven, eight, four, three, eight. I love that. Okay. And I'll second that. A second that. This is a version change. Any other comments? All those in favor of substituting version 74, version three eight. Please say I opposed the ayes have it. And I believe Councilmember O'Brien has an amendment he'd like to speak on. I do. I would like to move amendment number two to Resolution 31841, which adds some clarity to future actions about the bike master plan in the area of citizen arena and some report backs. And I'll speak to those in a second if I get a second. Second, thank you. So, first of all, I want to say thanks, Councilmember Johnson, for your work on this resolution and and your attention to transportation issues around this project. I also want to take a minute to say thanks to the the staff team that are working on this. Mr. Dellums and his whole team at Seattle Center did an amazing work and worked particularly closely on the transportation issues with Marshall Foster and Kevin O'Neill and your team. So thank you for helping us get through the back and forth. I want to thank community advocate someone. We're here today speaking. I really appreciate the excitement about the project and the excitement that we can become the arena with the lowest single occupancy vehicle mode split and the future going forward. I think that's a great goal. It's an ambitious goal and I think we're committed to do what we can to make that happen. What this specific amendment does is well, let me back up for a second. The timing of this was obviously I've been working on this for quite a while, but it's also quite compressed with an environmental impact statement being done on the master use permit being issued. And so just in the last few weeks, we've been able to get clarity on what transportation projects are going to be required as part of the Environmental Impact Statement and part of the master use permit. And there's a lot of great projects that are included in there, and I'm really appreciative of the work and look forward to seeing, you know, Ovg and their team deliver on those. And there are other projects that we were excited to have happen that are not part of that permit. And so one thing this amendment does is ask the Department of Transportation to come back and say there are other connections to the network as there would be anywhere that are still missing. And we would like to make sure we have clarity on what those pieces are, what streets we had planned to build those to make sure there's there's a safe pedestrian and bike access throughout the whole Seattle center area. And then we can go through the bike masterplan process to figure out where that falls, the priorities and where there might be future opportunities to fund those. This this amendment also adds in some specific language about an expectation and requirement for the department to make regular reports back to the council and to work with the community in that process in the next two years. So the the transportation plan, the AMP document will continue to evolve as this project evolves and as it evolves, I want to make sure there's opportunity for neighbors and advocates to be providing continuous input on what is going to be in that kind of traffic management plan. And the Council wants to have a role in that, too. And so this amendment includes language on how that will work out. Very good. Any comments on the amendment? It's already been moved to second. So basically the amendment adds the new section three is described by Councilmember Brian. All those in favor of the amendment. Please vote I. I oppose. The ayes have it. The resolution is amended. Any further comments on the resolution as amended? Councilwoman Johnson, I. Just want to say thank you to Calvin Joe of our central staff. He really stepped into the space here and helped facilitate a lot of the coordination between different departments to get this thing done in a very short order. And so that. Kudos to you, Calvin Joe, and thank you for all your good work. Very good. Any further comments? Those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended? Please vote I. I opposed the ayes have it. The motion. The resolution is not done. Cheryl Simon, please read the next agenda item.","A RESOLUTION requesting reports from the Seattle Department of Transportation, the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections, and Seattle Center identifying transportation projects in the vicinity of the Seattle Center Arena and describing the process for administering the Arena Access Management Plan.","Here is a focused professional summary of the key points from the presentation:

The presentation covered the adoption of a block of 10 resolutions (504-513) related to on-call contracts from the Department of Parks and Recreation. 

While most council members voted to approve the resolutions, Councilmember Sawyer voted against them. He explained that this was not due to issues with the specific contracts, but rather because the desired reporting structure from Parks and Rec was not yet fully in place. His ""no"" vote was to maintain consistency until that reporting improvement is achieved.

The resolutions were ultimately passed with 10 ""yes"" votes after the roll call vote. No substantive details were provided about the nature or purpose of the individual on-call contracts themselves.

The public hearing for counsel bill 1022 is open. May we have the staff report the results at all. Good evening, Theresa and Sarah with community planning and development. This is a map amendment for property at 2001 through 25 East 18th Avenue. It is located in City Council District nine in the City Park West neighborhood. And at the nine five. No, I'm just. I'm sorry. Did I just. I messed up. Keep going. All right. At the northeast corner of 18th Avenue and Ray Street, a block southeast of the Presbyterian St Luke's Medical Center, and four blocks east of Saint Joseph's Hospital, three blocks west of City Park. Property is 6250 square feet. It is a vacant duplex structure that is being renovated. A property owner is just modernizing the commercial uses allowed on the property to be in line with the adjacent properties. Again, the request is to rezone from a chapter 59 pad number 107 to General Urban Multi-unit. I'm sorry, mixed use three stories. So it is in the general urban neighborhood. That's right to my notes characterized by single unit two unit multi-unit residential with a in a variety of building forms, low scale commercial embedded in residential areas. So. Sort of your typical old Denver neighborhood. Existing context. Again, the zoning is that Chapter 59 PD. There is a view plane from City Park and the Natural History Museum that governs that governs the height on the property. And the allowed height is 73 feet. The property again is a vacant duplex that's being renovated. So the number 107 was adopted in 1985. It allows the old chapter 59 are for land uses, and that was their residential office that had some limited retail. And so north of the property is a general urban residential office. Three story east, north and south east is the x three, same as the proposed, and then west is a medical office building that's zoned campus h two, which is among the campus zone districts, is a transitional zone district. So again, sublet properties vacant adjacent uses. Multi-family commercial civic with the hospitals, a very healthy mix of uses in this area, the property you can sort of see behind the trees. But I just wanted to give you an idea of the height of the surrounding structures and kind of the variety of uses in the area, the property itself. You can see at the top of this slide, I'm on slide 11, just let's see, I can get my directions mixed up behind the property. Is the buildings on the upper right directly adjacent to the properties on 18th Avenue is the picture on the bottom. Right across 18th Avenue is the multi-unit condominium building and then a medical building across directly across race street on the upper left, all about well up to three stories or more. So informational notice on this went out in July, a notice of a complete application planning board hearing on September 6th, and the board unanimously voted to recommend approval of this. There was one person who testified who was the neighbor adjacent behind who really was there just to find out information about the rezoning. And then this was at the Land Use Committee on October 3rd and passed through committee. So we're here tonight for the public hearing. There are a number of registered neighborhood organizations in the area, but today we have no public comment on this application. So the plans that apply are Plan 2000, Blueprint Denver and a 1986 Uptown Neighborhood Plan, which I have to state was a very pleasant plan to work with. Its its recommendations seem to still hold up. So plan to 2000 tells us to encourage quality infill development to promote mixed use development, to encourage positive change and diversity while protecting our traditional character of our neighborhoods. To identify areas where increased density and new uses are desirable and can be accommodated, and to support retention of our businesses in the city. Blueprint Denver The land use concept is single family residential. Those are areas which are predominantly residential but which do have a smaller employment base generally embedded in the neighborhoods. And it is in an area of stability where of course we want to preserve our neighborhood character but also allow some reinvestment in our neighborhoods. Future Street classification for East 18th Avenue is a mixed use arterial. These are the types of streets that have a high degree of mobility, and a mixed use are generally located in our higher intensity mixed use areas, commercial areas and mixed well commercial and residential areas. Ray Street is an undesignated local street. The property is also within the quarter mile buffer of an enhanced transit corridor, which is York Street. And so those are areas where we want to have supportive land uses and policies for to support transit. The Uptown Neighborhood Plan, like I said, was adopted in 1986. It that plan vision is for an urban village to have distinct districts that are distinct in their building densities and mixture of land uses that is distinct from downtown, that is livable and economically vital. General plan recommendations are to reinforce the distinct districts in the area, to reinforce the distinctions between the districts, to encourage mixed use projects and to encourage housing. The district that the plan that this property is in is in the City Park West District. On the district map in the plan, those recommendations are to encourage housing, to encourage compatibility between new development and the existing residential and the well residential character of the District 4/18 Avenue to improve the pedestrian character and have hospital support and destination retail on East 18th Avenue and then retail recommendations to concentrate the retail uses on the east west streets particularly. Well, 18th Avenue was specifically named there and that the retail uses should be concentrated around. Some of the present retail development. So with that, staff believes that this application is conforming to our plans, that we are furthering the uniformity of district regulations by. Using our standard zone districts versus our custom zone districts, and that we're furthering the public health, health, safety and welfare by allowing this reinvestment in the property, by implementing our plans. Justifying circumstances are changed conditions. There are a number of new developments in the area, starting with the hospital redevelopment and a lot of new townhomes and condos in the area. So staff believes this is an appropriate changed conditions. And we did talk a little bit about the character of the general urban neighborhood context, multi-unit, single unit, residential in a variety of building forms, low scale commercial embedded within the residential areas, residential uses along local streets, but some commercial located along mixed use arterials such as 18th Avenue and then the Jim X three specific intent to promote safe, active pedestrian areas and to enhance the convenience and enjoyment of transit, walking and shopping and. That's about it. So with that, staff recommends approval. All right. Thank you, Mr. Sarah. We have two speakers this evening. We when I call your name, just come to the front bitch and I will start now. Adrian Weatherby and Alison Altair is. Out there is this study. Come sit down here. Mr. Wetherbee, your first 3 minutes. Thank you. First of all, for your public service. Thank you for supporting all of the issues that the first time bore witness to this evening. I was impressed. And I owe you that, I think. Thank you. My name is Adrian Weatherby. I work for a small architectural firm in northwest Denver. Our address is 3628 West 32nd Avenue. I am here representing this rezoning application. I wanted to thank Teresa as well. And Eugene, thank you for your work. The Planning Commission and the city staff again for the work on this application. As Teresa mentioned, the purpose of the application was remove restrictive code and allow a more modern set of commercial uses on the property. The property owner does not have any current plans to demolish the existing structure. The current plan is to renovate the first four units for commercial use and a second floor for apartments. We're looking forward to rehabbing the existing building, getting tenants in and making it a contributing member of the neighborhood. In terms of community outreach. We met with Capitol Hill United Neighbors several months back and took comments from them. We've reached out several times since then, and our understanding is that the neighborhood organizations are relatively neutral on this application. I'm happy for myself and our attorney, Allison L Terrace, to answer any questions the council members may have otherwise. We respectfully request your approval of this application. Miss others. Good evening, members of Council. Thank you for your time tonight. My name is Allison Altares. I'm counsel for the property owner and I'm only here to answer questions if you have any of my addresses. 319 Eudora Street. Great. All right, thank you. This concludes a comment portion. Any questions by members of council? I have one quick question. Is the owner of the property actually here? Out here? Okay. So so you guys are representing the owners. We had a conversation in committee around possible uses and obviously this is part of a food desert. We talked about, you know, grocery store. It uses things like that. Has that been talked about with the owner? Things like that? I think we mentioned that in kind of a summary of of meetings that we had previously to the owner. It was a very favorable meeting, we thought, and relayed some of those kind of ideas. I still think he's an undetermined at the moment as to what he might do other than restore it initially on the upper level for tenancy renters and some sort of commercial use on the lower level, although. So he will be using retail. We know that at the lower level, but he hasn't decided what what retail tenants would be in there. Okay, Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. Just a quick question for Teresa since hopefully you deep dived into that that uptown village. The small lot parking or. No. Normally that that's what I ask everybody that loonie. Yeah please don't bring that up. Yeah. There was a lot of forward thinking comments that you referenced here on that, you know, 31 year old plan. Mm hmm. You know, so hopefully, you know, these are things that we continue to sort of talk about debate. And now it's part of Denver. Right. I'm just curious because there are always some dated components. Did it talk about parking in this area and what did it speak to? Well, at the time the plan was written, there were multiple parking lots. I mean, the neighborhood was just a lot of parking lots. And in talked spoke very negatively about being parking lots for downtown. So I'd be it would be even it'd be fun. And maybe I'll busted out to see all the forward looking comments that are that are that resonate that you that you quoted, that resonate with a lot of our plans today. But it'd be interesting to see that because they were so impacted by all those surface laws that if they were actually language towards away from parking, that too would also be consistent with movements you see towards. Today, towards redevelopment. Yeah. So yeah, I've got my questions answered on the small committee, so thank you. Good. I'm glad yours were answer because mine weren't. All right. Thank you, Councilman. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Seeing no other questions by members of comment, public hearing is is now closed. Comments by members of council. Any comments by members of council? All right. CNN's Madam Secretary, recall. Black eye. Clark. Right. Espinosa. Flynn. I. Gilmore. I turned in Cashman. Kenny Ortega. Mr. President. I. We've got very nice results. Someone's. Sorry someone's. Missing. Okay. How about now? There we go. We got it. Tonight. All right. Ten Eyes counts about 10021022 has passed. Congratulations.

The Committee approved filing this bill at its meeting on 10-3-17.","Here is a concise summary of the key points from the city council meeting presentation:

Main Objective:
The agenda item was a zoning map amendment for the property at 2001-2025 East 18th Avenue. The request was to rezone from an older custom zoning district PD 107 to the G-MX-3 general urban mixed-use 3 stories district.

Proposed Change:

- Further uniformity by using standard zoning districts rather than custom PDs
- Changed conditions with new development in the area like hospital redevelopments
- G-MX-3 intent aligns with low-scale commercial embedded in residential areas

Contextual Factors:
- Property near Presbyterian St. Luke's and St. Joseph's hospitals 
- Surrounded by 2-3 story multi-family, commercial, and civic uses
- On East 18th Ave mixed-use arterial and near York St transit corridor
- In City Park West district per 1986 Uptown Neighborhood Plan
- Plan calls for concentrated retail, housing, pedestrian improvements on 18th Ave

So it's at your pleasure if you want to see the presentation or if you have any questions or if you'd just like to proceed with the item. Why don't we go to this? The inclusionary housing item? Do we need the presentation or are we saying no? Maybe. Maybe a short summary and then we'll go from there. Um. Good evening, Mayor and City Council. So earlier this year, the City Council adopted an inclusionary housing ordinance and inclusionary housing in the resolution and a no net loss ordinance. And at that time, there were five items that the council asked us to come back and revisit. And those are the items that are before you tonight. And as Christopher mentioned, we're recommending that all of those items be included in a revised ordinance and resolution two ordinances and one resolution. And we're able to do all five of those things. And the first one is to extend affordability covenants beyond 35 years for both ordinances, ensure that the inclusionary and fees are deposited into the housing trust fund and they are used to support the production of new, very low income housing units. And then we are, instead of revisiting the and Lupi on a three year basis where we're recommending per your request that that be done annually, we're going to remove the 2025 no net loss, no net loss expiration date. And then we're going to. The one item that we have to adjust is the offsite requirement for the low net loss units. The Council had asked that we remove that, but the city attorney has opined that we can't remove it. Instead, we're proposing that the City Council will be approving any no net loss plans that are outside. That concludes my presentation. Thank you. I think there's one member of the public that wishes to speak also. Yes. Senior can say. Mayor. Oh, thank you. Councilman. It's getting my levels right. I just wanted to comment in support of any strengthening of this inclusionary housing element here. And I think with respect to especially the Affordable Affordability Covenant being extended, it's imperative that while we create new affordable housing with respect to younger families, we also maintain the covenants that we have in house as a senior amount of our seniors within the city. And as the city becomes more and more of a pricey place for people to live in. These are some of the most marginalized and heavily impacted people when rents increase. So I commend city staff for recognizing this and taking and taking this into effect with with them ending with respect to the in lieu fee. I think that it's imperative. While it's great to see that there's a housing trust fund to push forward with expanding new housing. I think it's imperative that as real estate prices increase, you know, I'm and I'm speaking with the privilege of being a homeowner, you know, my ma my home equity value went up over $180,000 this year alone. With respect to renters, you know, that's just not something that's even feasible or possible because it's defeats the purpose of renting . So any fees that we're collecting in 2021 should be being applied to preserving affordable housing with respect to a lot of the older buildings, you know, just ten years ago, there was no Deukmejian courthouse there. And it's a lovely building. The presence of that building creates it becomes an economic driver for outside capital investment within the community, pushes people and displaces people. And, you know, the positives often get overrated by the negatives with respect to housing and with these fees that we're collecting, you know, the properties that the real estate is getting more expensive. So whatever positive impact that city could do with with respect to affordable housing in a in some small and smaller every year that we don't spend that money, you know, we see what our friends in the Los Angeles with the Prop eight, Prop eight money, you know, they have all that billions of dollars and haven't done anything with the money in the properties that's increasing. And so we're living in and we're really seeing a flight of people who are low income and even lower middle income who are not being able to afford to leave to live in the city. And so just our hope that we can speed up the process of using this money in lieu fees and no net loss element as well to just push for more affordable housing in the city. But I appreciate the city for amending the municipal code for the future. Thank you. Thank you. But that's rich. Did you have any comments? No, I support Councilman Allen. Any comments? I yes, I thank you very much. I appreciate your comments as well. You know, since the day I got elected and I put my big old fight 11 feet on this diocese, my number one priority was affordable, affordable housing. And everyone should have the ability to be able to afford to live in the city. You know, I just met again this week with a bunch of housing advocates and and I'm always open and listening to how we can strengthen our policies and how we create more affordable housing. So I'm always committed to that. And I really want to say thank you to staff for all of your hard work on this. I just really appreciate you and for taking I mean, and thinking about all of the changes that we were asking that you incorporate. So really appreciate I really appreciate you and just happy to support this today. Thank you to Price. You, Mr. Mayor. So we've gotten I think all the council members have gotten some concerns from. People that are interested in this topic regarding moderate housing and what we're doing in this policy to incentivize moderate housing. And I know that that's something that we've talked about a little bit on the council in terms of workforce housing. So not at that very, very low level, but at that moderate level. And the criticism of the proposal tonight by some has been that it doesn't take into account the need for the city to incentivize moderate housing. So can you talk to me a little bit about that and help me understand that that concern? I'm sure you've also heard the concern and what your thoughts are about it. Councilmember We are currently working with a consultant to prepare a party guidelines for middle income housing, workforce housing. I believe when we had the auctioneer come to, to the council council elected to have that, that particular project as a pilot program. And you had directed us to prepare a policy. So we'll be coming back to you with that shortly. And with a series of policies and priorities, recommendations for you on middle income strategies. And I would add councilmembers specifically on this issue. This was one of the policy options that we had brought to the council, probably three different areas where we looked at a moderate model, we looked at kind of a moderate, low income model, and then we looked at a very low income model. And council had a lot of fierce debates at the time, and we went with the model that you see today. So that was kind of a larger policy item that was discussed with the options and this was what ultimately was successful. Yeah. And when did that item when did it first come to us for that designation? Um, I believe or Jan was one of the votes and then it came back again in February of 2021. So it was right at the beginning of the year, if I remember right. July of 2020 is when the first proposal came and then the vote was in in January 2021 and then again in February 2021. Yeah, and I think and thank you for that refreshing of my recollection regarding the priorities. We have had some changes in council since we started to first discuss this policy. And and so I think it's worthy of mentioning I think for many of us, workforce housing and moderate income housing is really important. You know, we want to be able to make sure that the people who are working in our city can afford to live in our city. And, you know, working in and most of our traditional workforces right now would not provide the type of income that people need to live in the city, at least with the prices the way they are now. So I just want to be mindful of that. I think a lot of us that are having children entering into adulthood envision a world where they're able to live in the city and afford to live in a city with whatever salary comes out of their bachelor's degree if they should get one or a degree. And as it stands, there's just absolutely no way, no way on a on a salary of somebody with an A or a bachelor's and a traditional job. I understand there are some creative industries out there, but for the most part, just the earning, the return on the earning power of someone with a bachelor's or an AA is such that they couldn't afford to live here. So I'm very concerned about that issue. Councilmember Price, some members of the council, I really think that's next week's discussion. So I just want to focus, that's all on inclusionary housing as one tool among various different housing tools that the city is using to address different housing needs. So we're in front of you next week for an agenda item related to the housing element. We were in front of you recently for an item related to density bonus. So there are different tools. There's the CDA model, that Oscar reference. So there's different tools for different needs. I think in in the view of staff, the inclusionary item in the housing trust fund is, is focused on that very low income housing. But that's not to say we aren't addressing middle income housing in other ways with other tools. So I think next week may be a better time to have that that fuller discussion. And that's when we're going to be talking about housing policy and kind of strategy in general as part of the housing element. That's wonderful. Thank you for sharing that with me and refocusing me on that because I think it's important and we have a very diverse city and it's important we have tools to address all the needs. So thank you. Thank you, Catherine. Margo. I look forward to next week's discussion, but I also just want to thank the staff for their work on this so far. There's a lot of different advocacy groups and. I appreciate all the letters that we receive and very supportive of moderate housing. I actually went to a regional meeting of data and there was a presenter, like I said before, COBR now that kind of talked about the utilization of the resources and what that looks like across a region. And the speaker was from L.A. City, and they kind of looked at a a heat map. And so I'd be really interested in learning where certain types of housing, specifically moderate housing, could be best utilized and fit into the neighborhood. So I know Chris and I have had this discussion before, and I look forward to next week's discussion. And I appreciate my colleagues comments and the letters from all advocates on all sides. Thank you. Thank you. I have some comments, but I'll go back to basically Richardson. And I just I had a thought based on this discussion. I do remember, I think when we talked about this earlier this year, there was a discussion about the ownership. And I think we spoke to we reserve all the middle income, the modern income on the ownership portion of the inclusionary. How that. Is that correct? Yes. All the inclusionary units that are ownership are moderate income. Okay. And I'm certainly sensitive to the discussion about moderate income. And I do remember a healthy discussion we had about getting people into homeownership who are, you know, maybe have middle income. We want an only density given opportunity. We talked about inclusionary housing is one tool to downpayment assistance, another tool and a whole host of things. So I look forward to a more robust conversation about downpayment assistance, other things. Thanks. Thank you. Are the mikes working okay? I can barely hear the council. Just so you know, up here. I guess. I don't think we can hear each other at least. Okay. No, no problem. I just want to just add first, I think staff, this is actually an enormous policy that staff is working on for years. First, discuss, I think, with all of us after we put together a group of developers, business folks, housing folks to come up with a lot of many ideas around housing, talked about the state of the city, got brought to the city council. And I just think it's important also because I agree with every that's been said particularly about workforce housing. The the architecture of this policy was negotiated deeply with the development community, with the Chamber of Commerce at the time, but most probably with the housing with housing advocates. And everyone kind of came to the table and came up with a policy that that not everybody loved, but that absolutely leaned into the most important piece of it, which is setting aside units and every new development that we build that would be affordable at different levels, especially for low income folks. And this was viewed as and I believe it is a absolute step forward, an important step forward so that every single development in the city that's built includes housing affordability built into it, so that folks that are low income, very low income, are able to live in spaces that are shared and in with all types of folks . And the end is development. So this is a huge step forward for for the city. And I'll also add in talking to some, I have had some some folks reach out to me and ask for changes. And I did remind some of those folks that those were some of the same folks that were in many meetings with me a couple of years ago when we negotiated this proposal that were that said, okay, let's go with this proposal. So I'm very comfortable moving forward tonight, and I want to thank staff for all of their all of their work. Is there any public comment on this? You've already done the poll. That's right. Members, please cast your votes.","Recommendation to request City Attorney to prepare an ordinance amending Long Beach Municipal Code, Chapter 21.67, regarding Inclusionary Housing, to include recommendations proposed herein; Request City Attorney to prepare an ordinance amending Long Beach Municipal Code, Chapter 21.11, regarding No-Net-Loss, to include recommendations proposed herein; and Request City Attorney to prepare a resolution amending the method of establishing an Inclusionary Housing In-Lieu Fee, to include recommendations proposed herein.

Whereas in 1987, the Denver City Council approved funding for the design and construction of the Colorado Convention Center and in partnership with the Colorado Legislature, which approved purchase of the land. Ground was broken on for the center in 1988 and opened in June. 1990 is the 10th largest convention center in America. Where is the building was designed in a way that it could accommodate expansion. And in November 1999, Denver voters approved an increase in the lodgers and car rental tax to expand the center. It is worth noting that the architect's design included input from more than 200 national meeting planners, and that no doubt made it a better center. Whereas in 2002, the groundbreaking for the center expansion set a world record as the largest groundbreaking in history with more than 4000 participants. Yes, and I was one of them. And it was indeed crowded in 2004. Open is the largest public building in Colorado. 2 million square feet. And. Whereas, in 2008, Denver voters approved that increase in the largest tax for funds to increase tourism and convention marketing. And in since that time, 2008, the investment has reaped rewards. In Denver's tourism and convention. Business has grown 48% compared to the national growth of only 15%. Where is the Colorado Convention Center? Is known nationally as one of the greenest convention centers in the country, being the first to meet the Accepted Practices Exchange Apex Standard in 2012 and improving its leadership in energy and environment design. LEED rating to gold in 2014. And. Whereas, The Convention Center is an economic engine for Denver, generating $500 million annually in local economic impact, employing 200 full time and more than 400 part time staff. Driving demand for downtown Denver's 9000 hotel rooms and welcoming nearly a million visitors in 2014. Whereas the CDC is known for its public art, including the center's favorite piece of public art, the Blue Bear. And. WHEREAS, The Convention Center is a hub of continuing education for diverse industries and professionals from around the United States and the world . Where is the convention center consistently places its professional reviews by meeting planners is one of the top ten convention centers in the nation.

I hope that we will address this this proclamation this evening. Mr. President. It has been moved in seconding comments. Councilman Brown. Well, thank you again, Mr. President. I've been honored to serve on the Visit Denver board for more than a decade. You know, if you think about it, we've all seen the TV spots that celebrate the importance of fishermen and hunters to our rural areas. And their tagline on line is Hug a hunter. You know, when you walk in downtown and we are filled with convention, people here are there. They wear badges. You can't say hug a badger because, you know, that's Wisconsin and we're Colorado. But certainly certainly we should thank those individuals who are spending their time and money. And our city. So thank them when you see a badger around our city. And so I am grateful and thankful to be able to present this proclamation this evening and hope my colleagues will approve it. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Brown.

Thank you, Councilwoman Montero. Catwoman Ortega. Thank you. I want to thank Mayor Pena for having the vision of moving this forward in working with our state legislature. We saw that when the convention center first broke ground. We designed it so that we could add the second half later and a number of years later. We were successful in doing that and designing it so that our train system could go right through the center of it. And I also want to acknowledge colleagues that I served with who worked to place the issue on the ballot to expand the lodgers tax and thank the voters for their support in passing that that allowed part of those costs to to be covered. The work that our convention bureau does is incredible in terms of learning about all the different conventions that are out there that they could attract to this great city. And they do a phenomenal job in in bringing those visitors to this city and selling our city, our hotels or convention center . I don't know how many of you have been to Comic-Con. That was my most recent event that I got to enjoy, and it's just amazing, you know, the kind of interest that we have in the wide variety of activities and attractions that we bring here.

Structure the summary professionally for effective communication.",3,"The report of the City Council. Agenda item one accessible 119 451 really into land use and zoning w a moratorium on the filing, accepting acceptance, processing and or approval of applications for development in areas currently used as mobile home parks, declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date all by three fourths vote of the City Council . And I apologize. I was not clear on my order of the agenda. Councilmember Swan, you have the floor. Thank you, Bruno. And and let me just say, I don't blame you all for not knowing that there was not the legislation because this is parliamentary procedure. Why would you know it unless you absolutely have to? And even then, it can be very confusing. Thank you. So everybody who's been paying attention to the question of the al-Shabaab mobile home crisis knows what this is about. But I just want to do share to do a three quick stories of what we've heard from our community members at Halcyon. And one of them is Renny Hagan, who's a retired bartender and member of Unite Here, a local aid, who told us about being homeless for years, having lived in a tool shed with no heat or electricity or running water before finding a home at Halcyon, where she now tends a garden and grows vegetables for her neighbors. She told us she would likely be homeless again if the developers succeeded in evicting the mobile home owners. And she says, for seven years I've had the security without worry, and now they're going to take it away. Eloise MIKKELSON, whom you heard from just now, is the retired machinist and member of the Machinists Union, is a painter , musician and grandmother who has lived at Halcyon for 16 years. She says this is a caring community. We look out for one another. Some of us really would have no other place to go. You heard from Wesley Shearer, a former Teamster, who is raising a granddaughter who has special needs. Halcyon is a neighborhood where Wesley and his family feel safety and trust, he says. Help save our community because that's all we have. We know that what happened, as the committee members have said, was this property went on the market for $22 million. Garland based corporate developer named Blue Fawn filed pre-application. The residents have known about this because they got letters in the mail and they got organized. They got they contacted my office and we had an incredibly moving committee meeting on Friday, January 18th, where we had all these testimony and well, not only the residents, but so many of their supporters, some of whom we spoke to, they demanded that council take action. As it was said earlier, this demonstrates what you can accomplish by building a movement. And when that movement has its own voice in City Hall, this is what you can accomplish. You can actually win victories. And let me just say also, it is nice that Yudof is now saying that they will ask you as bank to sell the property to someone who wants to rent it, run it as a mobile home park. But the residents of Halcyon, as those of us who have fought for housing justice for years, no talk is cheap. The residents were promised that their homes wouldn't be saved in the past, but then they were surprised by a notice on their doors last fall, saying that the park was being sold. So we know that we know not to trust empty words. We know we have to continue fighting right the way. And we also know that because of our activism, Blue Farm, that developer has backed off for now. But we know better than to take promises and intentions at face value when a 22 million property sale is on the line. So if you have intent to keep this property as a mobile home park, then they will have no problem with council passing legislation for flowing from this moratorium to designate this region, this property with the manufactured home park designation. And as we've said before, Seattle will not be the first city doing this. The city of Portland has already done that. The Portland City Council unanimously voted last summer to do have a manufactured home mobile home park designation. They are mobile home park communities because there was a widespread demand from from ordinary people. Let's preserve for existing affordable housing. I want to do first of all, I want are a lot of people talking, but I wanted to first of all, congratulate the residents of Halcyon themselves. Can you please give yourself a big hand? And look at this Seattle Times cover page. This. This my dear friend and fellow activist. This is a testimonial to the kind of power you can build. When we get organized collectively and this has happened because we did that not because any one person championed your cause, but you do need your own voice. As at City Hall, as Linda Chase in the article says, there are million there are a million sites where developers can build. There are only two mobile home parks in the city. This is housing for people who don't have a lot of money. This is working class housing. Let's preserve it. And as HBO, they can said in the article, it shouldn't take a crisis for you to do something. It shouldn't take people with gray hair crying on your shoulders while these people with gray hair are done crying. They are now fighting. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien, for agreeing to co-sponsor the legislation. Thanks. Thanks also to Kendall Freeman and Denver Doan, who did a lot of the work on this and also getting arrested as usual, the council's central staff director. Special thanks to Nick Jones from my office, who spent a lot of time with you all. He's right there. And Jonathan Rosenblum and Saja Soma. And I wanted to join the others who have already said in thanking Unite here. Local eight OPIO Local eight. I am Local 751. The Puget Sound Advocate for Retirement Action, the Vietnamese Seniors Association, Trinity Methodist Church, the Faith Action Network. Reverend Angela Yang of the Bethany United Church of Christ. So many spoke in support of the preservation of this affordable housing. I really thank everybody. I also want her to know that not Paul Bergman is your long time member of the labor movement who's been here at every meeting with you all. You have a lot of support, but let's not stop here. Let's win this moratorium and let's make sure we keep fighting. I do have some closing remarks at the end before we take the vote. Very good. Thank you, guys, from Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. Councilmember Swan, thank you so much for your leadership on this. But I really want to give so much credit to the residents of Halcyon for your work to make this possible. In addition to everything that Councilmember Simon said, we have a lot of work to do to protect the remaining two mobile home or manufactured home parks in Seattle. And we have a lot of work to do to ensure that we have enough affordable housing for everyone in our city who needs it. And one of the things that you reminded us all again in your testimony today and last week was this is not just about housing. This is not just about a roof in a wall, but it's about community. And the power of your community has really showed up in amazing ways. And as we continue to build more and more affordable housing, we need to make sure that we're also creating spaces where communities, powerful communities like yours can form, because that's what we need in our city. So thanks for your leadership and work. Unless you're any other comments on the base legislation. I believe Councilmember Johnson has an amendment and we could come back to the base legislation for comments as well. So, Councilmember Johnson, you'd like to describe your amendment. Thanks. Appreciate that. Council president. As my colleague saw this morning, and for the benefit of the public who've heard this a couple of times, I'll just repeated the amendment that I'm bringing forward this afternoon would make a change to the fifth section of this bill, and it would insert two key concepts. The first concept is that a set of recommendations will be developed by the Office of Planning and Community Development and the Department of Construction and Inspections about what a set of long term proposals could look like for something beyond the moratorium that is being proposed today. And secondly, that that legislation will be transmitted to the committee that has jurisdiction over it, which is currently the planning land use and zoning committee. So those are the two substantive changes to the amendment. I'm happy to answer questions, but I know that our clerk would like me to read the official movement into the records that we have this official in front of us and that I will do. Now I move to amend Council Bill 119451 by substituting Section five as presented on the proposed amendment in front of you. Second, as. A council member, Johnson has been moved on. Second has made the amendment. Are there any questions? Just on the amendment only. Any questions on the amendment? Or would you like say, any closing remarks on the amendment? Councilman Johnson Councilmember comes from words or some remarks comes from awareness. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank Councilor Swan and her staff for bringing this very important issue to city council. And I also want to thank Councilmember Johnson for working with me on doing the making this this amendment. I am proud to co-sponsor this amendment. And I also want to thank, of course, the residents and the 47 people that showed up today and on January 22nd to let us know about the concerns about what goes on in the manufactured home mobile park. Some of the comments that I'm making now I made this morning, and we want you to know that we understand how important it is for this city council, any legislative authority to look at protecting the stock of homes that is manufactured homes in mobile parks, and that we know how important it is that we protect the use of such property. We had an opportunity to look at the law and run these issues by law. We had an opportunity to review the legislation to protect the use of such property over 30 years ago. We had an opportunity to look at the Lynnwood model and the Tumwater ordinance and to understand how the federal courts have upheld the city's rights, the legislative rights to protect the use of such property. Our goals here today are to address the lack of housing for our elders, disabled and marginalized communities. We believe that this is an emergency. Things today are not like they were 30 years ago. Obviously, I think it's important that the people that showed here today, particularly the residents, that this has never been a us against them attitude. This has always been about that we care that we want to know the facts, we want to the legal posture, and we also want to know where we are on solid ground to make sure that it isn't just a moratorium, but that we work towards protecting the land and its use. I want to share that something today that I read and actually last night. And I thought about you folks. You know, being on this job, you make difficult decisions. But this was not a hard one for any of my colleagues, quite frankly. But I want to share a quote, and it's really important for me to share this. Democracy cannot survive in a swamp of mutual contempt. I don't know. This country can survive if we all continue to despise each other. You don't have to change your mind about something. You don't even have to like me. You just have to realize that the person you're talking to is a human being. And sometimes we don't do that. So this issue today has always been about being supportive of particularly our elders. I've been at the Halcyon Park. My staff has been out there. Your circumstances have never been lost on us. And so again, I want to thank Councilmember Swan and her staff. I want to thank, more importantly, the residents. I know US chartered busses to come down here. I want to thank my staff who did all the research and the University of Washington, the people that we spoke to, to make sure we understood. I want to thank Legal for giving us the analysis that we need to make sure that we can make a sound decision that lasts. And, of course, I want to thank my colleagues that have come into my office to ask questions of. Councilmember Bagshaw was out there Saturday, I believe. And you really do have a council that cares. So thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Whereas. But I want to address just the amendment right now. There's been an amendment and it's been second. And I'm going to call on that vote. Would you like to see some more words on that concern? Just briefly, you know, I want to offer that as part of public testimony was mentioned, that people are going to be keeping a close eye on me and my committee. And when we're planning to take this up, it's our intention stated in this proposed amendment that we ask for a preliminary list of options to be delivered by April. So if in case people aren't clear enough that we're keeping this as a front burner issue, we're expecting at least a draft list of recommendations to come to us in April with the goal of adopting something before the end of our sort of policy calendar year, which is generally in the September or so time frame. And that's going to include a broad list of options. Many folks have talked about the Portland model, which allows for current property owners to transfer their development rights to other properties. There have been lots of discussions about the access to funds out of Olympia for people to be able to purchase the the land that they sit on for what would effectively be a home ownership opportunity, an edge away type situation. There's a lot of options available to us, so we're going to be discussing this more and looking for recommendations coming as soon as April. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. Okay. So it's been moved on second. And all those in favor of the amendment as articulated by Councilmember Johnson, please say I, I, all the polls say no live. The ayes have it. So now we are back to our base. Legislation as amended would come from our backs. I'd like to say a few words. A quick thank you to all of you. I did get a chance to visit on Saturday again, and I just want to very respectfully say thank you for coming and putting your arms around each other because you've created a caring community that really is a. Model for others. And I'll be honored to be. Voting yes for this moratorium and working with Councilmember Johnson to find the options that will really protect you long. Term. Thank you, Councilman Bagshaw. Consumer. Herbold Thank you. Just really quickly, I want to just sort of give a nod to your vigilance as somebody who used to herself be an organizer with the tenants union, as Ashfield Dickens was once. And I think Reverend Rich Campbell, I don't know if he's still in the room, was a founder of the tenants union. Vigilance is really important. And a lot of times, so many times the folks who are out there in the community in this case, in in your community or in other cases in apartment buildings, really know more about what's going on than than city government does. And so we really rely on you and your expertize and what you're hearing on the ground from your property managers or or from what what you're seeing from talking to one another. I think that's really important. And thank you, because it's really what's. Allowed us. To act. If it if it was not for your vigilance, we would actually be very limited in how we could act if this had gone on much further. So thank you. Thank you. Okay. I will say a couple of comments and then Councilmember Swan and ask that you close the debate on the issue. I'll simply say, number one, thank you. Thank you very much. I think that your story has resonated throughout the city, and I think that the entire city sort of looked at what you're going through and what you shouldn't have to go through. So I'm I'm excited about the discussions that will take place in a Councilmember Johnson's committee. I also heard that there was a park that has not been kept up to the standards that should be kept and some other things. And so I'm going to anticipate that during our budget deliberations, we'll also look at not just fighting for status quo, but what we can do to be a better partner to you. You are fine residents and fine Seattle folks, and so it's our honor to work with you. Thank you again. Thank you, Councilmember Swan, for your leadership in bringing this to the city's attention. And with that comes from everyone, please close the debate. Mr. President, may I make a comment? Oh. I. Timing is always off. But, Councilmember, I'm a skater. Thank you. I'm sorry, ma'am. Thank you. And I know council members won't want to close. I'll just say a few words. You know, I want to lift up some of the comments that Councilmember Johnson also mentioned in terms of the longer term vision, as we work on a comprehensive plan, it must be comprehensive for every family, for every retiree, for every artist , for every activist in Seattle, so that we have affordable housing for those who are currently here or those who've retired here, and for future families who we want to welcome here as well. I think this conversation today is just another reminder that we need to make sure that we're not only investing in more rent restricted, affordable rental units, but that we're creating more affordable homeownership options for everyone, including mobile units, including first time homebuyer options, including the ability to turn apartments like mine into our first time homebuyer options, and creating more affordable units as we create solutions to address the restrictive zoning that has limited our ability to have homeownership options. I think that we at the city level have been pushing our friends at the state level as well to get additional revenue in hand so that we can build quickly and respond more effectively to the fact that we don't have enough housing in the city, housing for our lower income and working families. And we don't have the opportunity to have lower cost homeownership options through affordable condominiums. This has resulted in people getting pushed into the streets and being people getting pushed out of our city. So I look forward to working with all of you as we talk about scaling up the type of housing that we can create in our city, scaling up to make sure that we're more inclusive city, creating more affordable housing for all working families, and that we look at this through a holistic approach to make sure that we are not responding parcel by parcel, but that we have public policies that reflect the values that working families and retirees ought to be able to live in the city. I'll also be working with you as we respond to the question of why the good sister who just left. She asked, Why are we in the situation where we don't have enough affordable housing in the city? And part of the reason why is because we've been we've had our hands tied for far too long with restrictive lawsuits and dragging seats. We have not been able to respond to the crisis of housing and homelessness. And I think what you're seeing here is not just a response to, say, protect the existing housing, but actually make sure that we have permanent, affordable housing for everyone. So let's make sure that this is the impetus that we need, as someone said, so that there's not an island of affordable housing in the mix of expensive housing and that we actually create affordable housing throughout the city. I'm excited to work with you on some of the pieces that Councilmember Johnson mentioned regarding transfer rights, regarding home away opportunities, and I'm going to be introducing legislation in the next few months that will be the tenant opportunity to purchase act so that when apartments like mine get sold while I'm living there, we get notification so that we can have the opportunity to come together and purchase together and we can have access to those resources to make sure that folks have the opportunity to stay in place so that we can afford our homes. I'm really excited to work with you on all types of affordable housing and to to use this as the impetus for longer term, more robust solutions across our city. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can someone get a counselor on this one? Thank you. So we we know that we have come this far to win the moratorium, but as you yourself have said, that is not going to be enough. We need to make sure that the manufactured home park zoning designation goes through and that is not going to be automatic. We are going to have to fight for it. And let me tell you, I've been I've been through this routine many, many times in five years now, where it starts a fight, the fight for some sort of justice, whether it's housing, justice, rent or just as a workers, justice starts with ordinary people demanding it. One or two councilmembers supporting it. A lot of you know. Pushback from a lot of corporate politicians, but when they recognize they cannot, then it's all where we always wanted it. So let's be very clear that we are not going to have to we're not going to be able to stop fighting just because we hear a lot of grand speeches today. We know what we're up against. We're up against a city hall that is primarily still let's let's be sober and not complacent, primarily still dominated by politicians who are, you know, serving corporate interests for the most part, and then are pushed into doing the right thing. So let's make sure that we keep building our movement to do the right thing. I really thank the Association of Manufactured Home Owners. I specifically wanted to thank Island Park for all the organizing effort she has done. Not just but Colin, not just in this battle, but you've all already fight fought a lot of battles. And I really urge you all to continue your work in forming your own homeowner's association. In reality, this homeowner's association will be like a branch of the tenants union because you are fighting for working class home ownership, similar, similar to tenants union, fighting for the rental rights of working class people. I really wanted to also thank the Tenants Union and by Seattle and Devon Southern Air who spoke, which really shows that we need to unite our working people, whether they are homeowners or renters. We need to unite us. We need to get united because our enemy is not each other. Our enemy is a corporate developer dominated city, a billionaire dominated city, as Imogene said. And also the fact is that, you know, a lot of politicians will talk about humanity while whose humanity gets lost in all of this. The humanity of ordinary people gets lost. Because when we lose our affordable housing, when we lose our rights, it's our humanity that is put to the test and that, you know, put to question. And that's why we should continue fighting. We should not apologize for fighting because that is the right thing to do. And let's wear it like a badge of honor. But any of my I was going to close debate. But implicit in your comments were, I think, baseless insults. If anyone liked to respond to it, I'll I'll let you respond. Otherwise, I'll just call for the vote. So. Okay, so we're going to call for the vote. Please call the role on the passage of the amended Bill. Herbold II. Johnson Suarez Macheda I O'Brien sir want. I. Beg John President Harrell all right. Eight in favor nine. Oppose bill passed and shared with Senate. Please read the next agenda item. You can read the short title.","AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; adopting a moratorium on the filing, acceptance, processing, and/or approval of applications for development in areas currently used as mobile home parks; declaring an emergency; and establishing an immediate effective date; all by a 3/4 vote of the City Council.","Here is a focused professional summary covering the main objectives, proposals, rationale, and context conveyed in the presentation:

- The presentation centered on establishing a moratorium to prevent the eviction of residents from the Halcyon Mobile Home Park in Seattle due to a proposed $22 million sale of the property to a corporate developer.

- Residents of Halcyon, many of whom are elderly, disabled, or from marginalized communities, testified about the affordable housing and close-knit community the mobile home park provides. Eviction could displace them with few alternative options.

- The moratorium aims to temporarily halt acceptance of redevelopment applications for the Halcyon site while the city explores longer-term solutions like:
    - Designating the property as a manufactured home park zone to preserve its residential use
    - Options for resident ownership/land trusts modeled after Portland's approach
    - Opportunities for residents to purchase the land, potentially using state affordable housing funds
    - Transferring development rights to allow affordable homes on the existing site

- Council members cited the need to protect existing affordable housing stock, create more affordable homeownership opportunities citywide, and enact comprehensive policies beyond piecemeal, parcel-by-parcel responses.

- While celebrating the moratorium victory, residents and advocates stressed vigilance, stressing this is an initial step and the broader fight for affordable housing and working-class homeownership must continue through sustained activism.

The core issue was preventing displacement of a vulnerable mobile home park community by exploring both short-term protections and longer-term affordable housing/ownership models, while framing it as part of a larger need for comprehensive affordable housing policies in Seattle.",0.8150000000000001,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly through logical reasoning about the core ideas and contextual factors first, without imposing premature formatting constraints.

Communication from Councilman Austin recommendation to receive and file a presentation from the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy on the progress of the Lower Los Angeles River Revitalization Plan. Mr. Austin. Thank you. As you know, ab5 30 created by a speaker renting created a lower L.A. River revitalization group that myself, Amir Garcia, are part of in terms of representing Long Beach. But there are several other cities along the lower L.A. rivers. And the working group has been working very, very diligently over the past several months to get to a place where we can have a great revitalization plan. And we've asked Mark Stanley, the executive director of the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, to come here today to give us a presentation. I think you will all be wowed. Thank you, Mark. Thank you. And Mr. Turnbull, Mayor Garcia, vice mayor, members of the council as mentioned, and Mark Stanley from the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy. I'm here tonight in the capacity of leading the group, the plenty effort that's taken place for the Lower Los Angeles River. I serve in many other capacities, which many of you know me by as well. The lowland L.A. River Revitalization Revitalization Plan is an effort to facilitate collaborative management of the watershed and make the river more accessible to the community a more accessible community resource. The planning process will lay the groundwork for revitalizing revitalizing the L.A. River and for improving our community connection to the river. I'm going to. Briefly. Oh, there we go. I'm going to provide a brief presentation on the activities that have been taking place through the planning process of the working group. I'm having a. Oh, there we go. Oh, there we go. I think we have a slight delay with the clicker. And I'm going to start off with the organizations that help to implement this process. It started with AB 530, which was introduced by Assemblyman Rendon. He was not the speaker at the time. As we all know, he is now the Speaker of the Assembly. He introduced legislation to create a working group for the lower half of the Los Angeles fervor. In that legislation, it outlined that the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy would staff the organization, and it would be an update of the Los Angeles County Master Plan for the lower half of the Los Angeles River, a plan that was originally created back in 1996. So the planning process. Well, that slide. Okay. There we go. The schedule has been such that we began in back in the fall of 2016. We're going through a three stage process. We're going to be concluding pretty soon. And we also have some community engagement involved in this, which I'll speak on towards the end of the presentation. So our first phase of the project was to gather input from the community, form the working group and engage the community in this process. The second stage has been to take some of those ideas that have been generated from community members and working group members and to start develop concepts. We're now in the final stage of the process. We're going to be drafting the plan and we'll do a final adoption after the first of the year. In terms of the structure of the program, we have a working group and I'll show you how many members are really involved in that process. We also have consultants that come in. They serve as technical resources to this process and provide us information on other activities that are taking place along the river corridor as well as the tributaries. We have a robust program where we reach out to the community and there's lots of community members who participate in this process as well. The members of the Working Group, 40 members strong, including the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy, includes all the cities along the lower half of the Los Angeles River. When I speak of the lower half of the Los Angeles forever, I'm talking from the City of Vernon down to your great city of Long Beach, and also includes many of the cities that are on the tributaries as well. We have two major tributaries, the Rio Hondo River, as well as the Compton Creek. Because of the size of the working group, we have divided up into a number of committees. One of those formats is for us to divide up into segments, and those segments are the upper middle and lower reach of the lower half of the river, the upper reach being above Rio Hondo, the Middle Bay between Vero Hondo and Compton Creek and Compton Creek down to the ocean. We also have plan element committees, the plan element committees, which I'll talk a little bit more about. It's structured such that the months that the River segment committees don't meet, we meet with the plan element committees. We want to maintain community participation throughout all this activity. As you see, community engagement takes place throughout the planning process. Committee Economic and Health and Equity Committee. A lot of that focus has been on gentrification and displacement. Topics as well as homeless support of our businesses and our work for workforce to increase equity among our community members and promote wellness and physical activity as well. We're also taking on aspects of how we can green the river corridor. As most of you know, it's mostly a concrete channel. We're looking at ways that we can enhance connectivity to the river, create public spaces, and enhance the experience that people have when they go along the L.A. River. Our Water and Environment Committee focuses a lot on flood management. One of the things that we don't want to do as we move forward through this planning process is compromise the flood protection that the cities enjoy today. As a matter of fact, we want to strengthen that flood protection. That is why we have a separate committee just to talk about water elements alone, how we can improve the flow of that water, how we can improve water quality to habitat biodiversity along the waterway as well. I spoke community engagement. It is built very much in this planning process. It is one of the chief elements for the formation of the working group. I'm going to talk a little bit more about that after this slide. I mentioned that we're in the third phase of the planning process. We're now starting to build those signature projects that will serve as examples of how we can provide enhancements along the lower half of the of the river, which will feed into an overall master plan for the entire 51 miles of the Los Angeles forever, a process that's beginning to take place. As we wrap up this work under the working group. So community engagement activities, a big part of what we're what we've been doing is engaging the community. We want to pull ideas from the community of what they like to see. Along the lower half of the river. We've had many presentations out in the community and we're continuing those throughout this month and into the early part of next month as well. We've had bike rides to engage people in different ways, as well as trail activities where we can engage in question. Community pop up activities is where we don't organize the events, but the community events that have taken place that we actually go out and participate in those events and provide some information about the planning activity that's taking place. We've held a number of workshops. We have a questionnaire that's online. I'll provide you that website at the end of this presentation. We have a newsletter and as I mentioned, the working group meetings. We have one that's coming up on Thursday, the first Thursday of every month, and they start at 6:00. Kickoff events, community workshops. I spoke up. This is just a couple of pictures of those activities that have already taken place, equestrian activities, the pop up events where we go to other community activities that are taking place throughout the cities along the lower half of the river. The movie night was a tremendously successful event. We were able to provide that activity down in the channel of the river, a place that community does not typically get access to. Even though we have not implemented any of the plans that we're talking about. You can see that there was a tremendous response from the community in wanting to participate in activities along the Los Angeles River. Some of the events that are coming. Up, as I mentioned, the working group. It's going to be in the city of Downey this Thursday. They rotate among the cities along the lower half of the Los Angeles River. We've been into the city of Long Beach, I believe, twice through this process. And I believe in November. We'll be back again. On October the seventh, we're going to have another bike tour. And actually every weekend in October, we're having bike tours that start at different points along the lower half of the river. It will continue to be engaged in pop up events throughout the city, along the river as well. I mentioned at the end of the presentation, I will provide you that website. That website contains all the information that I just talked about. In addition to detailing notes that have come out of each of the working group meetings that provide you information about all the activities that are coming up past activities. And it allows you to take a survey to provide additional input into this process. I thank you for inviting us here tonight. And that concludes my presentation. Thank you, Mark. And we're going to go ahead and continue. But once I'm sure it is, back over to First Councilman Austin. Give me a round of applause. Thank you and thank you, Mark, for that great presentation. And I just would just implore upon the residents who had an opportunity to see this, those watching at home to come out and participate in the community engagement models that are that are happening, because this is an opportunity for you to weigh in and be engaged in something that is going to be truly transformational along the the L.A. River, the lower half of the L.A. River, as well as the upper half of the L.A. River. It's an important project that the City of Long Beach is engaged in. And again, there will be some significant changes, changes that will will improve access safety. But overall, just just the importance of having a river in our city. And so I'm looking forward to to the vision being actually implemented. A lot of these meetings have been, you know, pretty tedious. And we've been really, really, you know, working hard to take in the input of everybody who has given input from those who would then question interest, those with the know recreational interests, those who want to see our water cleaner. And so this is this is, like I said, an opportunity to really change the game with the L.A. River and again, invite you all to participate. Thank you again for your great work. Mark. Thank you. Next replay of Councilmember Pearce. Yes. I want to thank you, Mark, for coming and sharing with us. I think the partnership that you guys have created along the entire river was going to get us to to see our vision through. And it's really exciting to think about places where we've had rivers that have been rehabbed. And really you're taking in all the animals and the wildlife as well as urban setting. It can be really exciting. And I just want to thank you guys for the work and think Councilmember Austin as well. Appreciate it. Thank you. Councilmember Elanga. Thank you, Barry. I also want to add my congratulations to Mr. Stanley. I worked with him on the Rivers and Mounds Conservancy, as well as with the Los Amigos Wetlands Authority. We has had a grand opening this coming Saturday, this past Saturday, opening up a new trail system along the lottery with wetlands. And he does some great work. He's he's surely a champion of not only protecting our wildlife, but also enhancing the opportunities for people to enjoy the river. And I also want to congratulate the rivers of mouth conservative, which which Mr. Stanley is the executive director of with the Long Beach must grant that was given the goal was what $2.3 million with up. To. 25 million. To. 2000002 million I wish it was 25 that went to towards developing also some urban wetlands along the river with the language arts program. So thank you for your presentation. Thank you for all your work. Thank you. Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Councilman Austin, for scheduling this presentation. And Mr. Stanley, thank you for your hard work on this. I know that this is one of the biggest opportunities we have along the river. You know, what's interesting is our river runs adjacent to a freeway and runs adjacent to some of the most economically and environmentally impacted areas of L.A. County. And the improvement in the focus on the river really is a big opportunity for us to talk about environmental justice and talk about economic justice in areas that really haven't had that that sort of investment. I'm really excited that that you are doing this. Level of outreach. I was able to participate in the meeting at the Michelle Obama Neighborhood Library in North Long Beach, as well as I know that there's a lot of discussion with the college about sort of the Long Beach Compton border, the intersection of the 91 and the seventh in the L.A. River. And I want to see continue to see more conversations about, you know, elevating that as a major area of focus for many communities that really surround that that that intersection of of infrastructure. So thank you can continue to count on our support and I look forward to continuing engage in this process. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Councilwoman Pierce. Actually, she spoke. Councilwoman Price. Thank you. Happens at every meeting. I just. Wanted to. Congratulate you, Mark, on. I know there. Have been new resources that. Have been infused into several of the organizations that you are in charge of leading. And I know that I too have the the pleasure of working with you as the chair of the Los Cerritos Wetlands Authority. And I think it should everyone on on our council should know if they don't already that you are probably one of the busiest men out there in terms of wetlands restorations and sort of preserve it in terms of preserving natural habitats and environmentally sensitive areas. You do really great work. I believe you very much have the interests of our city and the region in mind in the work that you do. This presentation was fantastic. It was nice to be able to get a visual and see the potential. So I want to thank you as as did my colleagues for your presence here tonight and for your continued efforts on behalf of the city of Long Beach. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Mark Boucher, for the appreciate the update. There is a motion and a second. Is there a public comment on the presentation over the mountains saying, nonmembers, please cast your votes? Motion carries. Okay, we have. So what I'm going to do is I know there's some folks here for the Indigenous Peoples Day item. It's it's currently it's at the end of the agenda. But I'm going to move it up. If I know I've talked to Councilman Pierce, we're going to try to hopefully keep it as expeditious as possible and move it from the end to now. So if we can go and hear that item. I know there's a lot of folks here for that. We'll just try to hear that one next. Okay. So with that, Councilman Pearce.",Recommendation to receive and file a presentation from the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy on the progress of the Lower Los Angeles River Revitalization Plan.,"Here is a focused professional summary of the key points from the presentation:

- This is a presentation on the progress of the Lower Los Angeles River Revitalization Plan, facilitated by the Rivers and Mountains Conservancy per Assembly Bill 530.

- The plan aims to revitalize the lower 51 miles of the LA River from Vernon to Long Beach and improve community connections to the river corridor. 

- A 40-member working group representing cities along the river is guiding the collaborative planning process across three phases: gathering input, developing concepts, and drafting the final plan.

- The process involves robust community engagement through workshops, tours, pop-up events, and online surveys to incorporate public input.

- Key focus areas include enhancing public spaces and river access, improving flood management and water quality, increasing equity and preventing displacement, and restoring habitat/green space.  

- Signature projects are being developed as examples for potential river enhancements to be included in the overall master plan.

- The presentation provided an update on the working group's progress, highlighted upcoming engagement opportunities, and encouraged continued community participation to shape the transformative vision.

Please read item number one. The report of the Select Committee on Housing Affordability Agenda. Item one Council Bill 118498 relating to land use and zoning. Adding a new chapter to 3.58 B of the Seattle Municipal Code to establish the framework for an affordable housing impact mitigation program for development, for commercial development and amending some subsection 23.4 0.0 20a subsection 20 3.76. 06b . Subsection 20 3.76. 06c and subsection 25.0 5.6 75i of the Seattle Municipal Code. The committee recommends the bill pass as amended. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. First of all, I just want to thank all of you for being here today and testifying in Kalamazoo, Burgess, for extending time to. It's really powerful for us to sit here and listen to so many different perspectives and stories about how the lack of affordability in our city is fundamentally changing. What I think of, and I think we all think of as as what Seattle should be. And we have a lot of work today, and today is a big step forward. Colleagues, I want to first address an amendment that's proposed for this legislation. And I would like to move this amendment, which is in our documents, and it would add a section one and then remember the the remaining sections. They would make the findings of fact and Attachment A and attachment A is about 15 page document that lays out the history of the recent history of where we've been on affordable housing and the work that's led up to this and what comes next. It's a great read for anyone who wants to read, and I hesitate to call 15 pages of summary, but it really is a summary of all the work that's been done and we're planning to do on affordable housing. So I'll go ahead and move that amendment. I'll second that amendment, and it is a great read, by the way. It's the whole history of what we're doing here and why. Any questions or comments on the amendment? All in favor of the amendment. Vote I. I oppose vote no. The amendment is unanimously adopted. So today before us now we have this amended bill and the next piece of legislation is a resolution we will take up, which lays out the framework for what we're going to do next year. This bill is around establishing the commercial linkage fee, or we're now calling the mandatory housing affordability commercial program. What this does is it sets a schedule of prices, fees that new development will need to pay towards affordable housing. This is a great step forward, but this bill alone will not produce any affordable housing. The resolution identifies the other steps that need to happen in order to make this bill work. What will have to happen is modest zoning changes throughout the city will need to take effect and refer to this bill before the affordable housing can be produced. We anticipate that the first changes will happen in South Lake Union and downtown and that that legislation would happen in the beginning the first half of next year. As soon as that legislation is adopted. All new construction in those zones would then be required to provide affordable housing. Similarly, there will be other zoning changes that happen. The majority of those will probably happen in 2017, and this is all in the commercial side. The resolution I'll talk about in a second will also indicate that we intend to pass an ordinance early next year to have an inclusionary housing program on the residential side that will similarly take effect as we make those zoning changes in the same neighborhoods going forward. I think that's all I'll say now. I imagine there's others that want to speak to this and then maybe I could wrap up and we're done. Okay, thank you. Any other comments? Councilmember Okamoto. Thank you very much. I'm in support of this resolution and I'm pleased and privileged that I get to vote on it. The city has been doing an enormous amount of work in the housing affordability arena. I was had the opportunity to be an alternate on the PSR Sea Growth Management Policy Committee meeting last week, where I heard about efforts throughout the region and the tools being used to fund housing affordability. And what I discovered is there are a wide variety of tools being used, many of them that we are just beginning to adopt that are in place elsewhere throughout the county. Well, this will be one of my last meetings on the council. This is also a statement and my hopes and aspirations for my colleagues that remain here and for new council members to come in, that this is the road map to help us get to more housing affordability. And while I won't be here on the dais, I may be out in the audience like you and hope that you hold this council accountable to implement these recommendations and those that are coming. Thank you. Council members. I want to thank you, President Burgess. Mandatory inclusionary zoning and all the recommendations from the Harlow committee are a good step forward, and I will be voting yes on the ordinance and the resolution. But we have to note that compared to a robust linkage fee with no phase in the measures proposed by the Harlow committee will take longer to implement. And that will mean that the people who are in need of affordable housing will either be without a home at all or will remain in unaffordable conditions for longer. The main arguments that we've heard for using the legal devices recommended by the Harlow committee and not going beyond that at all, is that this has been the grand bargain and that big developers have agreed not to fight against it. First of all, I thank everybody who every single one of the housing justice activists, some of you are here today who worked on housing issues for years. Some of you were on the committee. All your service is greatly appreciated. But we have to remember also that if we content ourselves with only demanding what big business agrees not to oppose, then we will not actually eliminate homelessness. We will never have enough affordable housing and working people will never get out of the relentless grind of living paycheck to paycheck. The goal has to be making housing affordable for all. The goal is not what is big business happy with. And so while I completely support the measures we are passing today, I don't think that we should stop here. Furthermore, if we believe that big developers will stick to the their end of this so-called grand bargain, then we are fooling ourselves. Every example from the past shows that they will try to get out of these agreements as soon as they can in the $15 discussions. We saw last year that big business fast food chains sued the city of Seattle to try and stop the minimum wage, despite the so-called bargain that was struck by the Income Inequality Advisory Committee . Just today, council members have received email from developer lobbyists arguing that the mandatory inclusionary zoning is charging too much. In other words, we will see them wriggling out of the bargain the first chance they get, and it would be foolhardy on our part to put any reliance on their word. I think we should be fighting to get this, but a lot more. And in addition to passing this resolution, we should revisit the linkage fee question in 2016, and we should be passing strong housing policies until we are able to say confidently that there is nobody homeless in Seattle and that everybody who has a home in Seattle has affordable housing. Other comments? Questions. So I'm just going to share a couple of comments about Council Bill 118498, which sets up essentially impact mitigation fees. There are 99 zero findings of fact attached to this ordinance, and several of them are critically important. Finding number 41 indicates that Seattle's population is projected to increase by another 120,000 people, and the city is projected to add an additional 70,000 housing units and 115,000 jobs by 2035. A significant portion of the additional households will be lower income individuals. Part of the demand for affordable housing is caused by commercial development. That's finding 42 finding 70 states that the purpose of this Council bill is through regulation to mitigate a portion of the impact of development of new commercial floor area on the need for affordable housing. Recognizing that the new lower wage workers associated with new commercial development increase have a demand for affordable housing. And I think it's important that the council's intent in passing this legislation is clear that we are establishing an impact mitigation fee to address these issues. Councilmember O'Brien Thank you for highlighting that. Councilor President Burgess. I want to just conclude by saying thank you to all the citizens who are member of the hall a process. This is one piece of that work that we can advance today. I want to thank Cato and the rest of central staff who's worked on this. This work goes back, frankly, to a resolution this council passed about a year ago. And they're a different framework, but a lot of the same a lot of the same work was done on that. I also want to thank Esther Handy, who's not here today, but formerly of my staff, who put a lot of work into getting this legislation to where it is. But mostly I want to just reflect on what I hear from the folks who showed up today and what we've heard and a lot of comments that this is a good and important step, that this alone will not do anything. There's a lot more work to do, and the work has to be much broader than just what we're talking about. It's great that this step is we're almost there to take this step that will require that all new development in our commercial and multifamily zones will be contributing towards providing affordable housing for the first time in the city's history. That is something to be really excited about. And yet we heard today that the challenges around affordability throughout the income spectrum for folks that have experienced homelessness or are currently experiencing homelessness to folks that are going to school. Two Working full time jobs. We're all struggling with how we managed to afford the city and we need to have to do a lot of work around this and the other recommendations that came out of Holla. With that, I look forward to voting on yes, on this. Thank you. Please call the roll on the passage of the bill. Lakota. Hi. O'Brien Hi. Okamoto Hi. Rasmussen Hi. So want I back to my garden? I Harrow and President Burgess nine in favor and unopposed. The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Please. But there's more. Please read item to.","AN ORDINANCE relating to land use and zoning; adding a new Chapter 23.58B of the Seattle Municipal Code (SMC) to establish the framework for an Affordable Housing Impact Mitigation Program for commercial development; and amending subsection 23.40.020.A, subsection 23.76.006.B, subsection 23.76.006.C, and subsection 25.05.675.I of the SMC.","Here is a focused professional summary of the key elements from the presented transcript:

- The legislation establishes a mandatory housing affordability program that requires new commercial development to contribute fees towards affordable housing. 

- It sets a schedule of fees that new commercial development will need to pay based on linking the impacts of new commercial growth to increased housing demand from associated workers.

- This commercial linkage fee alone does not produce affordable housing units directly. Separate zoning changes in designated areas like South Lake Union and downtown will enable the fees to facilitate affordable housing production.

- The zoning legislation for the initial areas is expected in early 2017, after which applicable new construction must comply with affordable housing requirements. 

- An inclusionary housing program for residential development is also planned for 2017 legislation to pair with this commercial program.

- This forms part of a broader affordable housing strategy recommended by the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA) Advisory Committee.

- While a step forward, some council members raised concerns that the measures are too limited in scope and timeframe to adequately address Seattle's housing affordability crisis comprehensively.

Overall, this establishes a framework and funding mechanism to require affordable housing contributions from new commercial development, coordinated with future upzoning, as one component of the city's multi-pronged affordable housing approach.",0.8150000000000002,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly through logical reasoning about the core ideas and contextual factors first, without imposing premature formatting constraints.

Communication from City Attorney, a recommendation and clear ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to COVID 19 worker recall declaring the urgency thereof to make the ordinance of effective immediately and read the first time and laid over to the next regular meeting of City Council for Final Reading Citywide. I have a motion. Can I get a second here? There's a motion in a second. As Councilmember Richardson and Councilwoman Price as the motion in the second. Councilor Richardson, any comments? Sir, I wanted to I wanted to offer Mr. Park an opportunity just to just tell us about this ordinance. Thank you, Councilmember. At this time, I'm going to ask Gary Anderson for principal deputy in the office who prepared this ordinance to give a short report. 1/2. We're having technical difficulties. Maybe mayor and council members. The proposed recall ordinance proposed tonight. Mandates that employees that work for hotels or commercial property businesses with 25 or more employees who are laid off on or after March four, 2020, will be hired based upon seniority. Employers are required to make. A written offer of employment to lay off worker for any position that becomes available with the laid off workers qualified. Qualified means the laid off worker held the same or similar position that is offered, or they can become qualified for the position. It provided training that is about a training that a brand new employee would receive. In the event more than one recall workers qualified for the position. The employee must give priority to the worker with the greatest length of service or seniority. Employees deemed managers, supervisors or confidential employees are excluded from this ordinance. At this time. I'm happy to happy I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. And. May members of the council. This is Charlie Parker. And again, just as this ordnance was brought to you at the request of the Council, I did bring it to you as both an emergency ordinance and a regular ordinance to give the Council the option to adopt it if they find that the urgency is necessary immediately. We do this as a belt and suspenders. It would also be have a first reading for adoption as a regular ordinance with a second reading next week and then go into effect 31 days after signed by the mayor. So if there's questions on on the process or the when it would go into effect, I'm happy to answer those two at this time. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Let me go back to Councilman Richardson. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Park. And thank you, Mr. Mayor. So this was, again, a part of City Council Directive as part of our economic relief package, to think about how we can further build some resiliency and a right to protect some more of our workers here in the hospitality janitorial industry. I want to thank the city attorney for bringing it and thinking about both the belt and suspenders. I know we had a significant amount of discussion on this, and I like where the council landed unanimously that we would have regular reporting. We would move forward with a regular ordinance, which is what's the agenda tonight, a regular ordinance which allows it to remain in place and not necessarily be tied to an emergency as established by the federal government or the state government or the local government, or really be able to be monitored and tracked as we go through this long economic recovery. And so that said, I'm I'm I'm going to go ahead and make the motion. So I move to adopt the recommended ordinance with three clarifications. So, one, we're going to limit the motion to include the regular ordinance after declaration of urgency consistent with the original motion made by council. Secondly, on insert language clarifying that the definition of hotel employer includes contracted lease or sublet premises connected to connect it to or operated in conjunction with the building's purpose or providing services at the building. And three Remove language. We're looking for the 19 pandemic from the definition of laid off employee. That is my motion. It's all consistent with the original motion, and these clarifications after review in the ordinance are necessary to make sure that we meet the intent as put forward by a unanimous vote of the City Council weeks ago. Thank you. Thank you. And then I have Councilman Pryce. I don't know if that was in motion or just queuing up without a second. Councilman Pryce. Yeah, I'm not going to back him, but I do. I do have a couple of points of clarification I want to make on this one as well. Yep. They're on pages six and seven. So Charlie or Gary, whoever is listening to this on page six. It's what I watch. Watch. I'm sorry. I got to move back to my item here. We're on a team, correct? That's correct. Okay. I have I have clarifying comments on all of the three ordinances tonight. Okay. My comments are on two, page two and seven on page two. I'd like to. Here we go. Never mind. I think that one already has been addressed. Page seven. I like the 90 day provision I would like, and this isn't really a change to the language, but I think that it should be clear that what we're asking for when the report back comes back is a recommendation as to whether the provision is still needed based on operational status of of hotels and relevant industries and whether they're stable and no longer having to lay off employees. So obviously, I think that's implied in the 90 day report back, but I wanted to make sure that that was that was clear clearly understood by our city manager that when it comes back, it really should encompass not just the welfare of the city or the city's recovery, as it indicates here, but really the industry. It should have some industry specific recommendations. So with that, I'm happy to second. Thank you. I think that is a that is a second. And you understood that also, Councilor Richardson. Yes. I don't think it necessarily changes or triggers the first reading. I think the council in price, I think it makes sense. This ordinance is and is limited to hospitality and hospitality and janitorial businesses all want to make sure that, you know, after report back is within the correct context. I think that makes. Okay. Great. So now no more no more comments. Please go ahead and do a roll call vote. This is the. District one. I miss her, too. I miss her. Three. I. District four. I. District five. I. District six. Hi. District seven. The Search seven. District eight. Hi. District nine. All right. Motion carries. Mayor that just for clarification, as the motion pointed out, there was no there's no second vote necessary as the there was no vote on the urgency. That was the vote on the first reading. So this will come back as a regular order and a second reading next week. Thank you. Thank you. Item number 19, please.

Final consideration of Council Bill 20 2-345 has been postponed to after the public hearing on Council Bill 20 2-352 this evening. Councilmember Hines, would you please put council bill 22, dash 352 on the floor for final passage? I'd love to. Move the council bill 20 2-035 to be placed upon final consideration. And do pass. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-352 is open. May we have the staff report, please? Thank you. Council President Gilmore and good evening. Members of the City Council. My name is Lily Jones. I'm with CPD Planning Services and today I'll be presenting the Farnworth Area Plan Amendment. My presentation is about 10 to 15 minutes long, and I will briefly cover the existing 2019 adopted plan, followed by a quick reminder on what initiated the plan amendment. And then I will wrap up with the summary of the staff report. So some of you were part of the vote that adopted what was then the very first neighborhood plan amendment or the very first Neighborhood Planning Initiative, which was the part of these area plans back in June of 2019. The adoption went through a 24 month planning process, which I was heavily involved with as a part of program project management team. And between 2017 and 2019, Community Planning and Development worked closely with the far northeast community to put together a really comprehensive plan that provides great guidance from and below Gateway, Green Valley Ranch and the DIA neighborhoods. And this great plan will continue to serve the far northeast community for years to come. The framework of the plan, which was adopted in 2019, address land use in built form, mobility and quality of life and infrastructure. And as you recognize, these are three elements of the complete neighborhood as prescribed by or in the blueprint Denver. The original 2019 plan adoption went through 20 steering committee meetings, five public meetings, one design charrette, and over 50 participations and community events attended by CPD staff, including myself. But today we're presenting to you a focus area upon amendment to the, ironically, the far northeast corner of the neighborhood. And the boundary of the plan amendment was predefined by their large development review, which is bounded by the future 72nd Avenue to the North Himalaya street to the east, the existing High Point Boulevard to the south, and then Argonne Street here to the to the on the western edge. An amendment to the recently adopted plan was needed in order to accommodate the relocation of Pepsi Bottling plant from its current location on Pruyn Avenue to the DIA neighborhood. There are four main components that were addressed or rather amended in this plan. The first is that we amended the land use designation to the specific area which was previously identified as a community center. And a community center is a place type that is intended to support a variety of mixed uses but doesn't support light, industrial or manufacturing uses. Therefore, to support a use like Pepsi Bottling Company, this area had to change its place type designation to value manufacturing, as you see identified here and on the map in Violet. The reason we had previously identified this as a mixed use is that we have we had anticipated that a light rail stop, I'm just going to call it out right here at the intersection of 72nd and Avenue and Himalaya was going to be developed. But since the adoption of this plan, we've learned that there are no plans to develop the light rail in the next 20 years. And so a mixed use would be difficult to support here without this light red light rail station. I should also remind you that the dark diagonal lines that we see indicated on the map, that's just to show us that residential isn't allowed north of 64th Avenue due to the disease influence area overlay. And so the change in place type from a community center to valley manufacturing is also needed to support the rezoning which my colleague Scott Robinson will present after me. The second change in the plan amendment is the change that had to be heard to be made to the Mobility Network in this area. Roads and mobility networks are highly dependent on the land use designations. And so with the changes of land use. We we don't need as many roads to connect across this this portion of the. The third man component amended in this plan is the transformative project in the DA neighborhood. This was previously called out as a line station at 72nd and Himalaya Street. But again, as I've already mentioned, this is no longer within the horizon of this plan. We have amended the transformative project to be Employment Center north of 64th Avenue. I do want to point out that there's still some language here and actually all throughout the plan that support the light rail stop in this area in case anything changes. And lastly, there are additional red lines throughout the plant that speak to either design quality, mobility, placemaking aspects, community outreach or just specific to the development of new manufacturing or light industrial uses in the far northeast community. We also facilitated market analysis for this area, which reported to which reported that the greenfield sites north of 64th Avenue where residential is restricted due to the the airport overlay. What's what was shown is that what's appropriate is light, industrial and manufacturing growth in this area. So this report also pointed out that industrial jobs have significantly higher wages when compared to hospitality. And hospitality is what we have previously seen develop in this area. So with hospitality jobs paying on average 1260 per hour versus $30 per hour, which is what the industrial wages are paying. So the market analysis also reported that the hotel corridor will remain strong along Tower Road. But again, the greenfield sites on the western and eastern ends of tower would be more appropriate to support light, industrial or manufacturing uses. There are three main criteria there are laid out in our plan 2044 evaluating area plants and plant amendments, and they are to assure that an inclusive community process was used to develop the kind of amendment that the plan amendment is consistent with the vision, goals and strategies of the plan. And then the plan amendments demonstrates a long term view. The pre-planning for the amendment started late in the summer of 2021, and we had our first steering committee meeting in October of last year, followed by a public meeting in December. We had a second steering committee meeting in February and we also sent out multiple email blasts and put out to a two week public review draft. I have three slides that touch on the most common themes that we heard throughout the public outreach process. The forerunner of these community asks for a community engagement strategy. And so we added recommendations in the plan that speak to building and establishing partnerships not just with Pepsi, but with any future employment uses, especially when it comes to job recruitment in the community and providing scholarships for certificate training and professional development for the far northeast community . We've also heard the community ask for transit access to the new employment centers, and we've included language that support shuttle services, for example, that connect people from transit stops to employment centers. An exemplar could be of that could be a shuttle from the existing 61st and Pena Boulevard to the Pepsi facility. We've also heard the community feedback regarding anticipated truck traffic along town roads and the impact it will have on road maintenance in. Well, Tower Road was designed to accommodate freight and large volumes of traffic. We did language into the plan that speak to developing road maintenance for Tower Road. Pepsi has also expressed their commitment to changing their fleet to all electrical vehicles by 2030, which will mitigate noise and air pollution due to truck. Truck traffic. The community also expressed that they wanted to make sure that benefits that were integrated into the hypo in general development plan for this area were not lost in the amendment process . And we have language of the plan that supports that specific to this property as it regards to open space trail networks, bridges and roadway connections. And those are all being carried over in the GDP update. Finally, the staff finds that the Foreign Office Area Plan Amendment was developed through an inclusive public process. So in regards to plan consistency specific to the comprehensive plan 2014, the far Northeast Area Plan Amendment is consistent with 31 individual goals and 67 strategies covering the topics of affordable housing, international intentional growth and development, supporting culturally rich and inclusive communities. Multi-Modal connectivity. Parks and open space. Health and safety and economic vitality. With regards to Blueprint Denver, the Farnworth area plan amendments address 22 individual policies and 53 individual strategies that cover topics such as land use and build form. Housing and transportation. Mobility and quality of life. The Map amendment stayed consistent with the previously adopted plan, and changes to these maps were only made within the amendment boundary. Steph therefore finds that the far north these area upon amendment is consistent with the comprehensive plan 2040 as well as the blueprint Denver. Lastly, SAP finds that the far northeast area plan amendment was developed with a long term vision and view building on the originally adopted 2019 plan. And so upon conclusion of this analysis, staff recommends approval of the in area plan amendment with conditions that the document would be edited for clarity and correctness. And with that, I thank you for your time. Attention. All right. Thank you, Lily, for the staff report. And we have five individuals signed up to speak this evening. And our first speaker is Steve Lawrence. Joining us here in chambers. Oh, okay. I will. Mr. Lawrence is attending, but is declining to speak. And so we'll go ahead and move on. Martin Wallace, who's joining us via Zoom. Go ahead, please, Martin. You'll have to unmute yourself. I. Good evening. Hello. Go ahead, please. Martin. You can go ahead and start. All right. We're going to see if we can get. MARTIN, you're the only I think we've got one other virtual. We'll go ahead and see if we can get. Martin back in the queue. All right. Well, we're trying to get Martin. We'll go in chambers. John Bennett is. We're in the public comment portion. The public speaker portion. You'll have 3 minutes to speak, sir. Thank you. Members of the City Council. My name is John Benitez. I have the privilege of being a resident of the city in county of Denver with my wife for 42 years. I'm here today. To discuss. The impact of the decision you are about to make. And I'm hoping that I can draw your attention, your focus on the importance of it in relation to a building that is in the path of progress here at 6850 argon. Eight years ago, I formed a company called BD Omni. We purchased a building in 68, 50, 68, 60 and 68, 90 Garden Street. I was hoping to be able to show you where it is on this map. But we are at the intersection of Oregon Street and 69th Avenue. Right now that property by the Army leases all of its space to seven tenants, one of which is the Denver Public Schools. We have a full fledged high school called Legacy Options High School with 125 students. We have administrative staff, a cafeteria, a gymnasium, principal's office. It's a full fledged high school. We have a church. We have five other tenants that are in the buildings. There are three buildings. The Church and a TV production company are situated. In the property that is and there. Premises are about 50 feet, which is almost the length of this dais for the city council members. From 69th Avenue. What we've learned and why am I here? I'm here not to promote my property. I'm here because there has been a lack of information given to us concerning a very pivotal decision made by Dottie. And I understand the accolades and I support them with respect to what Dotty has done for the city and county of Denver. What a decision that was made and indicates that the primary ingress and egress for 300 to 400. To up to I have read 900 tractor trailer trucks will be going past our building within 55 feet of it every day. Every day to go to the Pepsi Bottling plant. The Pepsi Bottling plant. Let's be clear about it is a 1.2 million square foot facility that will grow to 1.7 million. It'll start with 500 employees, which is terrific. They purportedly will come in from a different angle, but we will have 300 to 400 to 900 trucks a day. We have a lot of speakers. Everybody gets 3 minutes. And so we're going to go ahead and transition to the next speaker. Thank you for being here. And folks can ask you to come up for any questions that they might have. Next, we're going to Jesse Perez online. Yes. Members of council may be. Yes. Yes. Oh, good evening. My name is Justice for Black Star Action, Movement for Self Defense, Positive Action, Comment for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado, the East Denver Residents Council, front line Black News. And I'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023. And I live in District eight. And Councilman Hern, this district I'm in favor of this amendment to the far northeast plan for the green bill, a greenfield site to accommodate market demand since the plan's adoption. My question is, what exactly is going to be put here? I keep hearing it's either going to be a Pepsi facility or a community center. If someone please answer that question, I would greatly appreciate it. It meets. The three criteria consistency with the Northeast Denver plan consistency with Blueprint Denver and the long term view. Or efficient. So I'm in favor of the three amendments excuse me, to the Far East or Northeast plan. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Brian Conley. Good evening, Madam President, and members of Council. My name is Brian Connolly. I am with the firm of Otten, Johnson, Robinson, Neff and Ragan Eddy here in Denver. And I have the privilege of representing PepsiCo Beverages North America on the two matters that are before you this evening. As Lilly explained also, I should thank Lilly. She's done an excellent job of processing this area. Plant Amendment. As Lilly explained through the large development review process, we received feedback that an area plan amendment would be required, and we submitted a letter on March 9th of this year before the Planning Board hearing explaining our position in support of this area plant amendment. That's before you this evening. I would like to take this time to just mention three things, which I think underline Pepsi's support of the area plant amendment and why we think it's important to the city. First, manufacturing is really important to our community. We need to support its continued development. Manufacturing offers good paying jobs to people across the income spectrum, and economists have long agreed that communities that have manufacturing jobs have less income stratification and provide more upward mobility for residents. Denver has been losing manufacturing space and has lost manufacturing jobs as a share of our total employment for many years. And that's in part because we've set aside fairly little plant, little room in our plans for these types of uses, but the demand for them is high. This amendment and the Pepsi project that this will support presents an opportunity for our entire community to add manufacturing employment here in the city and for our city to become a model for sustainable advanced manufacturing. And on a related point, second point, this plant amendment will support significant developments in sustainability and technology. Pepsi's proposed bottling facility is intended to be industry, leading both in its sustainability and its technology. On the sustainability front, the company is anticipating the use of solar energy to power the plant with a goal of the entire facility being net zero. It is anticipating electrification of the company's truck fleet in the hopefully relatively near future and using the most advanced technology for wastewater recovery and recycling in the entire industry and the technology front. The plant will feature automated storage and retrieval systems, automated guided vehicles and advanced diagnostics and beverage manufacturing. The third thing is that this has great has several community benefits for the far northeast community. Pepsi looks at community benefits through four major ways workforce development, educational partnerships, community partnerships, and infrastructure improvements and workforce. This project will provide community members with access to jobs and training. On the educational side, Pepsi is looking at partnerships with local high schools and community colleges to encourage building technical skills and the community side. Pepsi will continue with strong philanthropic support of community organizations citywide as well as in the far northeast area. And our infrastructure improvements will include streets and parks and recreational facilities for community use. So with that, we do encourage you to support this a plan amendment. We'll be happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and try to get Martin Wallace back in the queue, our final speaker for this public hearing. And I see you're unmuted. Martin, go ahead, please. I am. And sincere apologies. We have storms in New York. So happy to answer any questions. All right. Wonderful. Thank you. All right. That concludes our speakers for this hearing. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 358. CNN. I knew as soon as I saw that. Councilmember Flynn. Go ahead, please. Thank you, Madam President. It was taking a while after clicking the button for it to appear. The gentleman from the church. Mr. Benitez. Could you come up? I don't get out there very often. So I'm relying on Google which. Maybe isn't the best thing on the planet, but it appears that the church is like a commercial warehouse structure or some kind of a light industrial structure is. Are there plans to build a church structure somewhere nearby? Is this a temporary home for the church? To my knowledge, no. It's not a temporary home. They are an active church that I built out. It looks like a warehouse, but it honestly is a church on the inside. Similarly, it looks like a warehouse with respect to the high school. It looks like a warehouse. But when you walk inside, it is. A high school. Okay. So is this. This will be then the permanent home for Saint Gianna Beretta, Molla Parish. It is to my knowledge that they have signed a long term lease with me. Yes. And they are there and they're active, not just on Sundays at seven days a week. Okay. Generally speaking, the. Is this an archdiocesan church? Yes, it is. It's affiliated with the Denver Archdiocese. Yes, it is. It's not one of those sort of breakaway Pius the 10th. No. The lease is actually referenced in the Archdiocese of Denver for the benefit of. Okay. That's okay. Because generally the archdiocese owns the real estate where it's churches are built. So I'm just curious. That's why I was finding it hard to believe that this was the permanent location in many ways to sell this to the archdiocese. No plans right now. They lease part of one of the buildings, and they're a great tenant. Mm hmm. And part of why I'm here is because the 300 to 400 to 900 trucks are going to go within 55 feet of their back door. Okay. Thank you. Was that basically the the tenor of the remainder of your remarks that you were not able to make? I appreciate you asking that question because no, I actually had other remarks to make, and I'd be glad to supplement, if I may. Madam Chairman. Madam President, can I ask him that? Go ahead. Thank you for allowing me to do this. God forbid I should not panic. I say, God forbid. I should not. The reason that I'm suggesting that the council consider this issue of whether or not. This area plan amendment should be approved is for the simple reason that there was a decision made. There were options in front of the Department of Transportation, also in front of Pepsi Bottling Company, as to where all of these trucks and how they should go into and out of their facility. A decision not easy to make, but there were three options 69th Avenue, which abuts my property. 70th just north of it. And 71st. Just north of that. The decision ultimately made, to the best of my knowledge, after participating in the process and I filed objections or I filed our comments just as Pepsi did for the Denver Planning Board. But the decision was ultimately made without, to my knowledge, taken into consideration whether there was an impact on our building or on the hotels that are on 69th Avenue, those properties and the guests in those properties. There's going to be a lot of traffic no one has requested. We're asked whether or not this would impact our property at all. I have filed comments saying it will impact our property somewhere within the Department of Transportation, perhaps CPD. It's hard to say where the ultimate decision finally was made, but it was made to do it on 69th Avenue, which will severely impact the operations of my property . If the decision had been made after the city and county of Denver through its departments had actually. Gone in and understood. Is this going to impact you? Tell us what it will do. Having all these trucks every day. It's not just a NIMBY thing. It's this is what's going to impact our property. And I have 125 high school students and our high school. That are right there in DPS. I talked to them today. They are considering possibly expanding. There's a lot going on. But my point for the council to consider is that as this decision was made, it was made, I would characterize in a vacuum without having those of us, whether it's in an industrial site, whether it's a hotel, really talked to and allowed to voice their concerns. To me, it didn't happen. I wished it had. If the decision had been made, once that knowledge was shared, then I would accept the decision. I don't think it's there. I just do not think that process was undertaken. One of the things that I and I'm going to just say this is I truly, sincerely believe it. After 42 years here, many, many, many years that I've lived here, I have been thankful and very proud of this city and the state, quite frankly, of the decisions that we have made as a city and as a state . And what I'm challenging this city council is please. Please use best practices. Let us make the best decisions we can. We are smart. We can come up with solutions to issues and but let's hear people out and understand truly what impacts are. So I really appreciate the open question. Thank you. Thank you. That's all. Thank you, Madam President. All right. Thank you, Mr. Barnabas and Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sawyer. Thanks, Madam President. Just had a couple of, I guess, quick clarifying questions for CPD. So we haven't approved the amend the amendment yet and we haven't approved the rezoning yet. So those things have to happen legally speaking, before a site plan happens. Can we? In which case things like locations in and out. Of. And access to for trucks. Would. Be made. So I'm just a little confused about kind of where we are in the process in the background. Good evening, sir. My name is Steven Wilson. I'm with Community Planning and Development and in the large development review group. So I have worked with the applicant team and the different divisions in the city since the beginning of 2021 on this project. And to specifically answer your question, so there's a general development plan amendment and that has not yet been approved. That general development plan was presented to the Planning Board for feedback, and then the ultimate approval authority is the Development Review Committee. So you're correct that approval would be contingent on this evening's approval of the Area Plan Amendment and the rezoning. Okay, great. So, so the reason I ask that is because then that would suggest that there is still potentially time to, you know, discuss other options. Or. Consider. Impacts to surrounding businesses that maybe were unanticipated. That is correct. And if I may, I could give a little bit of background to that right now. So, again, thank you for the opportunity. So in the process of evaluating, there are actually four potential options at 69, 70, near 71st and 72nd. And through a process with Dottie community planning, development and the applicant in their plan, it was determined that 69th was the best option for safety reasons, that there is a streetlight already planned for 69. It allows for connections to the east. It allows for stacking of vehicles. And it again, it was overall the safest connection that we could do for the project based on the context. And to Mr. Benitez's point, there will be impacts to adjacent properties, but each of those other options has adjacent properties as well. Okay. And I think you mentioned, Brian, maybe you mentioned electrification of the the fleet. So. That could mean a lot of different things. Does that mean, then, that Pepsi's fleet will. Be quieter. And less impactful on the environment as a whole because they're electric? I mean, I used to have an electric car and people used to walk out in front of me all the time because they couldn't hear me coming. So I can attest to that. But I just wanted to kind of walk through that. I actually had a law school professor almost ran over me with an electric budget. Yeah, it's a thing. Yes. So if the if if the cab, you know, if you're an electric cab on the front of a truck, it's not going to have all the diesel noise that would come with a usual truck cab. There's still maybe noise from braking. There may still be, you know, noises associated with, you know, tire tires running along the pavement. But it would it would be quieter than a diesel cab. Okay. I really appreciate that. And I think that covers all my question. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Sawyer. Councilwoman Black. I'm just going to further clarify what Councilman Sawyer said. Whoa. Lily. By approving this amendment to the plan, are we approving that 69th Avenue will be the road that is accessed by the Pepsi trucks? So the the plan isn't the right tool for whether the 69th or 71st. In fact, the plan as you can. Well, I don't I can't share the screen now, but if I could, you'll see that the the deck there's no actual language in the plan that says 69th versus 71st or anything like that. It is graphical, it is diagrammatic in terms of sheer the potential connections that we can have. And then there's a legend there that's attached that says, you know what, one is a priority versus another one is as a second option. And so we facilitated that. There's a69 connection, and we also have an arrow that shows 71st connection as a potential potential network. So the. To to answer. You know, in order for this plan to be approved or in order for zoning rezoning to be approved, the plan is to be approved. But then it would kick in the GDP approval as well. Right. But by approving the plan amendment tonight, we are not approving the GDP. No, you're not. I just wanted to be clear on that. Thank you, Councilmember Black. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to ask how many lanes are anticipated on 69th Avenue? Is it anticipated to be widened from what it is today? Would. How many lanes are there right now? Again. Stephen Wilson, thank you for the question. So although I'm not an engineer, I think I have the answer to your question, which is that right away would ultimately support four lanes. To start with, I believe it will be two lanes with turn lanes that go with that. Okay. And that's a planner answering him or engineering questions. And how does that differ from 56th Avenue that runs in front of or is this GBR in front of the B Dennis campus? I believe it's 56th Avenue that runs in front of the Sandoval campus as well, which has a significant amount more of students in both of those campuses. Are you familiar with the the width of the roads in front of those two high schools? I apologize. I'm not. Okay. Councilwoman Gilmore, could you answer that question? So could you please your question again? I'm just asking, how many lanes of traffic are on 56th Avenue and is it GBR or 56 that runs in front of every Dennis campus? So it's Green Valley Ranch Boulevard runs perpendicular to every great Dennis campus. Telluride runs in front of it. But 15/6 Avenue is currently I mean, it's ultimately planned for six lanes, but we are getting an additional two lanes on 56th Avenue from Pena all the way to Peoria. So really the Montebello side in Green Valley Ranch, it's more so built out for the six lanes already on 56th Avenue. Okay. And that one is the one that runs parallel to the Sandoval campus. Right. Which has middle school and high school. Correct. I just wanted to sort of make that distinction between those locations, which I do know, on 56th Avenue between Pena Boulevard and Quebec Street, actually all the way down to I-25. As you go to the west, there's a lot of heavy truck traffic that travels on that particular corridor. That's normally the route I take when I come from the airport. So I don't have to, you know, sit with me. But I just wanted to point that out because I. Insensitive to Mr. Benitez's concerns. But as we have seen this part of our city grow, we have had to figure out how to address moving people back and forth, and particularly where we have some of the industrial businesses that happen to exist out in this area. So I think those are the only questions I had. So appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And I'm going to go ahead and pose a couple of my questions and then we'll bring Councilman Flynn back into the queue. Lily. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. So when we had brought folks together for the far northeast area plan, we had great representation by both community organizations and residents in Green Valley Ranch . We got folks in Parkfield, High Point and Montebello. And could you talk a little bit about how we reconvened those steering committee members? Yeah. So we we had a fantastic steering committee that was really engaged in the original 2019 adoption process. And so we reached out to them again and we pulled community members from each one of those areas and asked them to rejoin. So we weren't starting that process from scratch. It wasn't people who, in terms of steering committee members who weren't involved in that in the original plan since this was so recently adopted, it felt like we just came back together and got back to work and really concentrated on the small area. So it was a really great process. Great. Thank you. And how many meetings? I know you talked about that. We had our kickoff meeting in October of last year. And could you talk a little bit about the attendance by committee, by steering committee members? And then we also had some wide scale public meetings as well. Could you talk a little bit more about the the participation and the conversation of folks? Yeah, well, certainly, given the fact that we are in a pandemic right now, the public meeting structure, which was previously done in in the Foreign Office, communities, community centers, high schools, and, you know, in a place where people really felt comfortable right. As part of their community, we this time around, we were meeting online. Right. And that was a completely different experience. We didn't get to connect in the same way in with the steering committee. We met twice. We exchanged a lot of emails back and forth, and one of the ways that I convinced everybody to come back together is I promised that I wasn't going to exhaust them with a lot of steering committee meetings. And so they were really engaged. They were really present. And then with the I think on average, we would get about 45 people showing up online. Again, that's that could be said, that's a lot in a COVID environment to an online participation, especially for an area that's, you know, there's no permanent residential community here. So it's all greenfields. Great. Thank you. And in those meetings with the community, I know a lot of times we talked about, you know, having a specific idea of what the truck routine would be so that there was consistency for community members. And so we talked about the free traffic scholarships and educational support that the community would want. Could you also talk a little bit about the workforce development and what was important to the community through having a large scale employer literally in the back yard, back yard or front yard of District 11? Yeah, we and that's one of the things that we reached out to the or we use the market analysis that we facilitated. Right. We weren't just thinking as we developed this with, with the community, but we weren't just thinking of Pepsi as the sole user like this. We anticipate similar type of in light industrial users like that facilitating. I wish I could pull the map up again because if you remember, it's hotel row along tower and greenfield sites all along. And so there's a lot of language that we included into the plan that spoke to building those partnerships, specifically with these kind of employment centers that are coming in, incorporating partnerships and creating neighborhood agreements that would foster those kind of, you know, relationships that we would we could anticipate the scholarships, we could anticipate job training. We could anticipate employing people from the community. Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate that, Lily, and your leadership through this process. And I would like to invite Mr. Benitez up for a couple of questions, please. Hello. Thank you for being here, sir. If you wouldn't mind what I. If I recalling which of the steering committee, the community meetings. Were you able to attend? I attended the February 24th of this year. Community meeting. Yes, I did. I attended and spoke at the Denver Planning Board. Hearing that consider this issue and we submitted comments to that. So, yes, I did do that. Okay, great. Thank you. So you were at one of the meetings and then you attended the planning board. From the the conversation with your high school, how long has the high school been located in this facility? They've been there approximately five years and they have about another four or five left. Okay. With renewals that are available. Great. And I know that in one of the meetings, we had talked quite extensively about the educational and also employment and career options that this might pose for students at your high school. And it sounded like from that meeting that it was something that you might be interested in pursuing, knowing that this far Northeast Amendment is separate from the rezoning hearing that we'll have after this. Great point. Let me let me add a comment. The company that owns this real estate. It's a small, limited liability company. We have seven members. We do not we do not object to the development that Pepsi wants to do. We're strong supporters of that. The objection that we have goes to one thing, and it is a decision that was made, and I don't know whether that decision was communicated during the other public hearings that Lilly described and perhaps you were referring to back in 21. And whether the attendees of those hearings truly understood there's going to be 300 to 400 to 600 to 900 trucks going on this particular street, because for the members of the council, there was a mobility study completed December 15th of last year. And that mobility study focused on 71st Avenue as the way to get the trucks in and out. And that mobility study concluded that that was the best route in and it did not address. 69th Avenue and decide the 69th was the best way in. That decision was made sometime in January or February or March this year. And it was made and I wonder whether that decision was truly communicated to members of the public particularly. The company I'm referring to be the Army. The hotels on 69th Avenue truly today understand that there's going to be this much traffic going by their hotels. And I question whether that that was truly made clear or not. So we do not object to the development. And should we support it? We support the jobs. Great, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. And then I don't know if this question is perhaps for Lilly, because when we were working with the community members, they did want something documented around. A. Truck reading agreement. And so the council office had worked closely before this rezoning was filed. That's right. To negotiate and to work with an adjacent property owner to assure that, because that was the recommendation from the members of the steering committee and community members, that they wanted a bit more reliability on removing trucks from Tower Road and actually rerouting those trucks onto Panya Boulevard more. So is that accurate? That's correct, yeah. So the good neighborhood agreement and the reason I didn't bring it up because these are usually not tied to the plan, the plans themselves, they're associate usually with the rezoning, which my my colleague Scott was going to refer to. But Brian, do you want to speak to the development agreement? Great. Thank you. And Brian, if you could, go ahead and introduce yourself for the record. Yes. Brian Connolly, again, I'm representing Pepsi Bottling Company, North America. So the agreement that you're referencing, Council President Gilmore, is a it's a truck routing agreement between Pepsi and the surrounding master association that controls all of High Point the development out there, because those are the most affected owners. Those are the ones that would be affected by truck routing and through the course of conversations. So so I want to just take one step back, which is the community meetings on this project actually started with the large development review process. So the community meetings actually started before the far Northeast Area Plan Amendment even was was discussed or came about. It started before the rezoning was was the application was filed. And in those community meetings we, we were required to notice properties all around the subject property. And so those notices went out to the entire hotel community up and down Tower Road. There were hotel owners that actually attended even that first community meeting on the large development review process. And one thing that we consistently heard was we don't want truck traffic going into the residential areas that are south of this property. As Lily mentioned, there is residential south of 64th Avenue. And so I think the feedback that we received from Green Valley Ranch, from Monticello, from people who live in the community, was we don't want truck traffic in our residential areas. Obviously, truck traffic in residential areas is also bad for Pepsi because that's certainly the slowest path by which you can transport goods out of the the proposed plant. So in working with the community immediately around this property, we we developed a truck routing agreement which provides for trucks to be routed west out of the facility to Tower Road, where they will then access Pena Boulevard and would actually then likely go on to E for 70. So so even keeping them sort of out of central Denver to the extent they're going westbound. So that's what the truck routing agreement provides and it's a binding contractual commitment. I would also just add the truck traffic piece. I would also just make one more clarifying point because I want to make sure we're operating on a consistent set of facts. There is no plan to have 900 trucks a day with this facility. This facility, as we've said consistently throughout the process, is anticipated when it when it opens to have approximately 12 trucks an hour, which comes out to about 280, 290 trucks per day. That number certainly could increase as production increases, but there is really no way that there would ever be 900 trucks a day. And I'm not really sure where Mr. Benitez got that information. Great. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate that. All right. That wraps up my questions for now. And we'll go it looks like Councilman Flynn, you're up next. Thank you, Madam President. You stole my thunder with the truck routing agreement. I was wanting to go into the background of why that was. That's not a city requirement. Lilly Correct. The truck routing agreement is in our packet and I was reading through it and I was just curious why 69th Avenue was chosen. I guess the city is not part of that, is it? Because it's between the High Point Master Association and Bottling Group? I'm not sure if I'm following your question. Does the did the city. Did we ask Pepsi and the. Joint. Master Association to come up with this truck routing agreement? We are not a party to it. That's right. So do we have anything to do with the do we ask for it? Well, we suggested that that might be the route to take. When we heard the the feedback from the community during planning meetings. Obviously we're not insisting on. No. Well. Or is this a disgusting thing? Brian, could you could you respond? I'm just really curious, because when Mr. Benedetti was talking about 71st Avenue, 71st Avenue was two blocks closer to Pioneer Boulevard, and it would mean two fewer blocks. My wife is not listening, so she can't correct my grammar. I think it's two fewer blocks traveling on Tower Road. Why? Why was 71st Avenue not chosen for this? I mean, because it goes right into the ACM High Point site. That it does actually. So 71st Avenue was the access point to the site that was initially proposed by Pepsi. Right. So if you can and again, if if we had the map up, it would be helpful. But if you can envision the geography out there, 71st Avenue and Oregon meet each other at what is essentially an L intersection. So 71st Avenue ends at Argonne right now. Right. The original proposal from Pepsi was to just extend 71st Avenue into the site that Pepsi is purchasing. Right. And feedback that we received from Dottie, we actually heard a few pieces of feedback from Dottie, which I think are important to this analysis. The first is that if if 71st were extended into the Pepsi site, you'd have a dead end street. We don't usually do dead end streets in Denver. It complicates things like snow removal and street maintenance and whatnot. Secondly, Dottie wanted a through connection to the East to improve connectivity in the area and so 69th allows for that. If you if you had 71st be that through connection through that property, you would you would basically preclude the construction of a manufacturing plant because it would be right in the middle of the property. The third reason that Dottie was concerned about that approach is that 71st Avenue, if it were used as the access point to the plant, it would result in trucks stacking or backing up westward from the plant entrance, which I mean, again, it's sort of anticipated that there would be 12 trucks an hour, a truck every five or 6 minutes. But if you had a stacking situation, the trucks might actually back up to the Tower Road intersection. The 69th Avenue alignment allows for a thru connection from High Point Boulevard over to Tower Road. It then also allows for what will ultimately be a long North-South driveway from 69th Avenue into the Pepsi facility so that you really don't run the risk of trucks stacking or backing up out under the public streets. Any of that stacking would occur internal to the property. And then the final reason, the fourth reason that Dottie, as I understand it, rejected the 71st Avenue proposal is that 71st Avenue, there is not enough stacking room for trucks that would be turning left off of Tower Road onto 74. So if you can imagine driving south from Panya Boulevard into where the hotel district is, you've got left hand turn lanes. There would not be enough room for trucks to to back up sort of backward north from 71st. And that would then impact the bridge that the bridge overpass where the line goes over Tower Road 69th Avenue, again allows for that through connectivity. It avoids the stacking issues. It will be a signalized intersection at Tower Road. And I'd also just point out that as part of the GDP amendment process, there is discussion about the applicant actually making transportation improvements to the intersections at 69th and Argonne, as well as at 69th and Tower Road to improve safety. Okay. Thank you. At. I guess I'm looking at the subdivision map and I. I just don't see I guess I don't see the sense of that. The 71st 69th Avenue being a thru route. Are we? We're going to punch it through to Aurora. Because it connects to High Point Boulevard at the Aurora city line. It would be no longer or shorter than 71st. So I'm a little befuddled. The left turn stacking cutout on Tower Road, it looks to be the same length turning left from tower to 71st as it is tower to 69th. So I guess I'm a little befuddled in the long run that this is not something that I would base, you know, a decision on. It's a it's an agreement between two private parties. It's not involving the city. But I just find befuddled by. So if you can shed light on it. Really, that's great. If not, we should move on. I just. Is there an option to share the screen? Again. Thank you so much. I just want to clarify to what Brian was speaking to. Here's the 69th Avenue connection. And these were really I mean, we spent hours and hours and hours with daddy trying to understand how to move traffic along here. Obviously, I'm not a traffic engineer either. I'm a planner. And so I'm going to do my best to explain and reiterate what Brian, which was speaking to you. But essentially what you get on 71st Avenue is a private roadway, right? That's just servicing Pepsi and Daddy's priority. One of their priorities was to make that through connection, that it wasn't going to be just in and out. But there was an opportunity to navigate traffic, not only for Pepsi to use, but for to connect across to what potentially would be 71st Avenue or 70 I'm sorry, 73rd Avenue across into Adams County as well. And then the intersection here, this is where Brian was speaking to you. The way that the the trucks lining up as they're coming down, pioneer would just cause too much of a congestion here and the ability to to make those left turns versus the ability to take a left turns here. And then again, as Steven Wilson mentioned, there's going to be a signaling that's going to be in place and that's already plan at 69. And that also created that as a priority over 71st. And lastly, the stacking of vehicles. This allows for the stacking vehicles, the length of that within Pepsi's property as they as they wrap as the trucks would wrap around here, which didn't didn't given just sort of the footprint and the layout of the building as proposed, which is very strict, as I as I learn, based on their operational needs, it wouldn't been a lot like they wouldn't have had enough room to do that on 71st. Okay. I. I guess I'm still scratching my head 69th as I'm looking I'm looking at that on my screen here and 69 Wiggles and whines to High Point Boulevard and then it goes up. I know that's Dunkirk. And then over again on 70th and then up on Himalaya, seems to be 71st, goes right into the plant and that would be where you want the trucks to go rather than winding through 69th and High Point. Yeah. And as Brian mentioned, that was that was our first and initial consideration. But it just no matter how much we tried it, it wasn't working. Okay, technically. Thank you, Madam President. Driven out there lately or had to go down Tower Road or once you get off Penn Yan Boulevard, it is a very short stretch of road and you could see very quickly how the trucks would start to stack up. That's right. Coming off and then impede traffic both on Tower Road. That's right in on Pena Boulevard as well, trying to get off on that off of that off ramp that definitely. I'm glad you're asking the questions. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Ortega. Thanks, Ben and President Lilly, I wanted to ask a question about you had mentioned that. Pitney Boulevard was one of the preferred routes to take to sort of keep that traffic out of the neighborhood. Mm hmm. And I don't know if we have anybody here from the airport. But I think we do. I remember we are going through a process of adding additional lanes because of concerns that traffic that's not going to the airport. We actually had to pay some fines to FAA because that road was built with airport dollars. And I'm just wondering how we're encouraging people to use Pinners that are not airport traffic. Right. That would would be using that corridor to then, you know, come into this area. And I get we want to keep traffic out of neighborhoods. But at the same time, I don't want to make I don't want to create more planes for the airport either. So is there anyone that can speak to this issue? I think Brian or Jen. I will I will do my best to answer it. And if I do something incorrect, then somebody behind me is going to kick me. So. We had discussions with the airport about the use of Panya and about the funding question and improvements to Panya. Ultimately, how those discussions were resolved is that because of the planning process that the city is going through right now, it was not the appropriate time to decide whether or how Pepsi or any other property owner along Panya would contribute to resolving that situation. The reality is that Panya was built with interchanges that serve the properties around it, and it's a public highway. And so that, you know, in working with through the airport and the city attorney's office, it was determined that this was the best approach to take with both truck routing and with addressing the issues of hand. So I think this is something that warrants having some input from the airport attorneys to make sure that we're not putting the airport in a in a box, if you will, as we encourage more and more development out in this area. I know it has been anticipated that we have airport development, and it may be that, you know, if this facility is going to be shipping out product to other cities, other states, it may be somehow deemed as an airport related operation. So that's where I think having that clarity from our our city attorneys from the airport may be helpful because I know that we don't want to get in trouble with FAA as as we've seen in the past, where we had to pay fines. And I'll go ahead and unless Brian. You I was gonna say I mean I've spoken to airport attorneys about this I don't know if any member of the city attorney's office who's present here would like to weigh in on it. But yeah, I did. I mean, so I've had extensive conversations with Josh in the mayor's office about this, and I'm blanking on Josh's name. Lepley Yes. And so, you know, in talking with Josh right now, we have traffic on Penna that is not sitting in county related, it is not airport related, it is commerce traffic. We're not currently it's not a toll road. We're not restricting Adams County, Arapahoe County Commerce City, Aurora from utilizing Pena Boulevard. And I would hate to see us restrict a large scale workforce development employment center in the far north east by holding ourselves to a different standard than what the airport is currently holding other municipalities to. And that hasn't been a conversation, I believe, that long ago when we explored the conversation about a toll road, we knew that that was going to restrict growth in the far northeast, and that wasn't anything that the airport wanted to do either. And so the airport has been well aware of this process as it's been going through, you know, the different channels. Are they going to come forward and publicly say, yes, we want you to do that? No, they're not. They're going to stay silent on it. But unless you've got new information that that's where we had left the conversation, I don't have near. And for me, I've just been struggling with trying to figure out how to answer your question. And I know I should have an answer. I was the transportation commissioner that involved in the project office, but I don't have the specific correct answer to your question. The more general answer to the question is that application. Of user fees have been evaluated for Pepsi Center, as you know, in. The for the for Pena Boulevard in general. But there isn't going to be a move to apply user fees for one specific user. So there could in the future be. A reevaluation of whether there. Should be user fees for for Penn. Boulevard. For all commercial uses or for commercial uses of a particular type. But the airport is not going to institute. Specific restrictions for one specific user. I get. That. Yeah. But I guess as we continue to encourage more development on airport property. It appears as though this is something that we're going to need to figure out how to tackle as as we attract more and more commercial or industrial development. I'm I think this is a great project for our city. I think it's a great project for the far northeast area. But I think we we just have to be really clear that, you know, we've we've crossed all the T's and dot it all the I's. And Shannon, I understand you have that. Expertize that you bring to the table. Having worked with CDOT and being involved with a lot of our big projects that we have in the city. But I just know that in the past we've had to pay fines because people driving on the airport on Pioneer Boulevard that were not going to the airport, we got dinged for it. We the airport. And so I just hope there's some way as as we encourage more development out there, that I heard you very loud and clear that there would be fees attached to the project. Is it you made reference to fees. That there are. Not user fees currently for the use of any boulevard. That there could be a general. Reevaluation of that in the future? The Chip Projects Office. Actually has a regular check in meeting with the airport administration to talk about sort of all the issues about real estate development. I will put that on the agenda for our next meeting, just to ask if, you know, if they're considering. This. In the future. I guess the other question to ask is, as we're moving forward to add more lanes of traffic to Pioneer Boulevard that. As I understood it would otherwise accommodate. Traffic that is not going to the airport. How? You know, like, what's the timing of that? And then how do we see that getting us out from, you know, being fined by FAA? So anyway, that would be part of those conversations with the mayor's office. But I appreciate everyone attempting to answer my questions. Thank you. Sorry, I can't be more specific. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for those questions. And I hope we get to that point that we have more development in the far northeast, that we have to entertain some of those fees for the use of our roadways. That would be great. Not seen any other questions. The word we're within our meeting right now, sir, and the public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 352. I want to go ahead and I'll make my comments first about that. This is in the far northeast and this has been a long time coming. We had great community engagement with the Far Northeast plan when we went through that initial process. We reconvened the same community members because they were very well versed in what the far northeast area plan and the intent was. And we reconvened those co-chairs and they did a really great job of through Montebello 2020, through Montebello Organizing Committee, through Girls Trek, through Montebello, walks through the Green Valley Ranch Citizens Advisory Board, through a variety of civic minded and community based organizations, came together and really made recommendations that we held Pepsi to a high standard. We held the the potential use. We vetted all of the different options and talked through it with the community. And we wanted to be cognizant that we didn't want truck traffic going through the residential areas. Now, do schools change do churches change locations? Yes, they do. We know in Denver public schools that they're currently closing schools because they're not seeing the enrollment numbers that they used to have. And I would ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this far Northeast Amendment, because it will bring almost 500 high paying jobs to the district. And we have a plan in place to reduce the negative effects of that development in the community. And I would ask my colleagues to support this far northeast area plan amendment this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22. Council members say to Barker, You're a little late on the queue, but go ahead and get your comments in, please. Thank you very much. I am currently housing Pepsi in my district and currently live in a neighborhood surrounded by these job providers like Purina, Manna, Pro and Pepsi and Coke. And the list goes on of people or companies that we've sacrificed our communities to. This is it feels incomplete. It feels like we're prioritizing the business over. The bike impaired experience in these neighborhoods, the residential experience. I have a camera outside my home that captures how many semi-trucks go down my street. They're not allowed to go down. And every day I count hundreds of them. And so I'm very concerned about this and definitely don't think we have enough information about the agreements, about the stakeholders who are affected at the schools in this location. And so for tonight, I'll have to abstain, but wanted to make sure that I explained on record why I don't feel like this is complete and why I feel like there is potential harm or unintended consequences of not fully fleshing this out before we support it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman CdeBaca. And I'll go ahead and close out the comments. I'm going to tonight vote on my vote with my community and that there is no residential community of Denver residents in the area. And I'm carrying forward the will of the district 11 residents who fully vetted this process. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, Dash 352, please. Black. I set about to abstain. Clark. I.

The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 3-29-22.","Here is a concise summary of the key points from the presentation:

- This was a public hearing on approving an amendment to the Far Northeast Area Plan to accommodate the relocation of a new Pepsi bottling facility and distribution center to the area.

- The amendment changes the land use designation to allow for manufacturing/industrial uses, adjusts the mobility network, removes plans for a light rail station no longer anticipated, and designates the area for employment center development. 

- Community outreach was conducted through reviving the original steering committee from the 2019 area plan adoption process and holding public meetings.

- Key community feedback addressed workforce partnerships, transportation/truck routing, trail/open space connections, and ensuring promised development standards carried over.

- The amendment is found consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and Blueprint Denver guiding plans. 

- A property owner raised concerns that impacts to his church and school tenants from anticipated heavy truck traffic on 69th Ave were not fully evaluated before selecting that truck route.

- Pepsi explained their rationale for preferring the 69th Ave truck route over others analyzed and committed to measures like truck routing agreements, roadway improvements, and electrifying their fleet to mitigate impacts.

- After discussion, the amendment passed Council by a vote of 10-1 with 1 abstention, advancing the Pepsi development but not finalizing specifics like the truck routes which require additional approval steps.

The city is proposing an initiative to establish an affordable homeownership program by leveraging surplus public lands. This takes advantage of new laws enabling low-cost transfers of public land for affordable housing development.

The program aims to create affordable for-sale homes near jobs and transit in amenity-rich neighborhoods that would otherwise be unaffordable for many residents. Specific projects outlined include:

- 19 affordable condos to be built in the Phinney Ridge neighborhood
- 8 affordable townhomes in the Loyal Heights area

By utilizing underused publicly-owned sites, development costs can be reduced to extend the impact of affordable housing investments. The affordable homes created through this program would remain affordable long-term via community land trusts to prevent displacement of residents over time.

The core objectives are increasing affordable homeownership opportunities in high-opportunity areas, preventing displacement, and maximizing the public benefit from underutilized land assets.

Guzman-Lopez Would you please put Council Bill 380 on the floor? Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council vote three zero. So as of 2019 be placed upon final consideration, do pass. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill 380 is opened. May we have the staff report? Welcome back. You're welcome. This is a second one. But let me get out of this 1/1 and. Okay. So this one is a legislative rezoning. It is for the University Park neighborhood, and it is to rezone from urban edge single unit D X to urban edge single unit D several properties in the university neighborhood university. I'm sorry, University Park neighborhood. So it's approximately 1051 properties, about 183 acres. The reason, again, the rezoning is from urban edge, single unit D X to urban edge, single unit D and the applicant. Here is Councilman Cashman. So what the effect of this rezoning would be, too, would be to remove the suburban house form from an allowed building use. So a little bit of background. Back in 2003, there was a quick wins to that did address oversize homes or additions to homes. And then in 2010, we modified that. And then we, we developed the urban single unit, d-essex, which does allow both the suburban and urban house form. Effectively turning back the clock to pre nine 2003 standards. And so this is an attempt to take us back to some of the wins in quick wins to where we were paying more attention to the form of the homes being built. So the suburban house formed the issue with suburban house forms that it's two and a half storeys or 30 feet in height or up to 35 feet if you have a wider lot. And it allows you to build up that form from the front of the lot to the rear of the lot. There's a ten foot bulk plain on the side and then a 45 degree angle where the bulk plane curves over the property. And this gives you an idea of the form that could be created under that built building form. So as you can see, it kind of doesn't fit with the area. So the Urban House form is that two and a half stories, but only in the front, 65% of the lot. And then a one story part of the house in the rear. 35% of the lot can only be one story or 17 feet. And this gives you an idea of what that bulk plane, it looks like for that building form and does fit a little bit better with the existing homes in the area. So. The existing zoning in the area is ESU X to the north is more single unit to the south more single unit. There is some multi unit to the east and to the west and then some mixed use and multi unit that's higher near the do campus to the west. So the land use is mostly single unit residential land uses, mostly through the center of the area, but again, multi-unit and retail off to the east and then the campus to the west. So some of these photos give you an idea of the existing homes in the area. Some are single story, some are two story. The zone district does allow that two and a half story. So Pre-Application review of this started back in December of 2017. And then there was an extensive public outreach by the councilman and the neighborhood organization, and there were two meetings, some mailings, a couple of open houses and a survey on the web. And then the proposal was submitted in December of 2018. In April of this year, planning board unanimously recommended approval. And then this was seen at the Land Use Committee on April 23rd and then first reading on May 6th. And then we're here today. There is a letter of support by the University Park Community Council and eight other comments supporting the proposal. You know, their letters, one letter of opposition and one letter simply just asked some questions about the application. So because this is a legislative rezoning, there are three criteria consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, and furthering the public health, safety and welfare. So the plans that are apply are Plan 2040, Blueprint Denver 2019 and the University Park Neighborhood Plan of 2008. So 2040. Current plan tells us to enhance our neighborhoods through high quality urban design and use urban design to contribute to economic viability, public health, safety and environmental well-being, neighborhood culture and quality of life. And to preserve the authenticity of our neighborhoods and celebrate the history, architecture and culture of our neighborhoods. The neighborhood context is urban edge, which is predominantly residential. Typically low scale single and two unit residential with some small scale multi-unit embedded in the area. The place type is residential low, which is again predominantly single in two unit uses, small or medium lots with lower median building coverage and buildings generally no higher than two and a half storeys in height. The street types in the area Yale Evans are residential arterials. St Paul McTell. I love for residential collectors. All others are under the ignited locals. As far as the growth area blueprint Denver. This is another of those all other areas of the city seeing 10% of new job growth and 20% of new housing growth. University Park Plan was adopted in 2008 to perpetuate and enhance the integrity of the neighborhood. It has always been, according to the plan, a variety of architectural styles. But there was concern at that time that the new homes were not consistent with the overall fabric in terms of open space, tree canopy lot coverage, building orientation and building mass and building heights. So the plan did talk about single for the single family portions of the neighborhood, preserving the single family nature of the of the area and respecting the urban design and architectural character. And so the proposal to rezone from the assumed text to the study fits that very well. So staff does believe this is consistent with current plan 2040, Blueprint, Denver, 2019 and the University Park Neighborhood Plan by using a standard zoned district where furthering the uniform application of our zoned district citywide and by and we're furthering the public health, safety and welfare by implementing our plans and also furthering the general welfare of the University Park residents by removing a building form that they've identified as problematic and protecting the overall single family residential character of the neighborhood. So with that, staff recommends approval. Thank you very much. We have eight individuals signed up to speak this evening on this item. So I'm going to call the first five up if you want to come up to this front bench and then you'll be a little bit closer when we call you. So the first five I have are Jessie, Paris, Sherman, Sekou, Carolyn Eder, Candace Christian Christensen and Rosemarie Stoffel. Jesse Paris, you're up first. Jesse Paris, represented for Denver Homicide, a low black star action movement for self-defense, and positive action camera for social change. And I was on top of the ballot for at large this past May 2019 election and will be back in 2023. Again, I was against this because a lot of these rezonings involve a lot of displacement and gentrification. But I'm real good friends with this councilman at his district. So I trust his judgment and trust that he will do the right thing in regards to this. So with that being said, we're in favor of this. We need to maintain the character and and architecture of our neighborhoods. So. Yeah, we're in favor of this, I guess. Thank you. Next up, Chairman Secret. That's German so-called black star action movement, self-defense. The city is suffering from an identity crisis. And our communities no longer represent who we are. As Coloradans. And when we take the opportunity to go back in our history to reclaim our identity, it means and blends the old with the new in a way that's harmonious. And so we commend Councilman Cashman for coming with a old school solution to a contemporary issue as we recapture who we are in the city. And contrary to popular belief that we need to be something other than who we are. As a lifetime resident, I'm proud to be a part of the city, its heritage and its culture. And this is where I choose to live, and this is where I choose to die. It don't get no better than this. And so. I hope. That other members of council will. Pick up on this idea, especially in the neighborhood that I was born in the Five Points, and I'm currently living on the East Side in Park Hill as I'm doing right now. Isn't this. I don't know what this is. And I remember back in night and there I would do a little research in 1990. It was a quiet in the city that you had to bill Brick. That's it. Because that's what the city was committed. And that was the best architectural designs and depth and sustainability of housing that we got housing now that was built by brick that's going to be here for the next 200 years. But this stuff that they build it now on flood and when planes. That paint is already fading. In Council District with nine and eight. I'm looking at this. And I'm saying, well. I wish the airport was back. That could stop this. Because now we don't even know who we are. No, we don't. And the people come and have no respect for our culture whatsoever. They think we're a country with this world. Well, if we all of that and you all are distant, why are you here? So why are you here? So there has to be a reestablish of respect for the local history. Just like you respect New York City. You can come here, you can respect a mile high city no matter what the income is, because this is who we are and this is how we like it. Thank you. Next up, Caroline her. I'm Carolyn Etter. I live at 2278. South Milwaukee Street. Thank you for the opportunity. Can you pull the microphone down just a little bit? Thank you. Thank you. There you go. He's taller than I. Thank you for this opportunity to share with you a little. History about. Zoning. 17 years ago, and none of you were on council at that time. There was a issue having to do with the zoning ordinance that had just been passed, and it was clear that there needed to be some changes made to what was. Called the long house form. It had firstly affected the. Single family neighborhoods. Throughout the city by. Impacting the privacy and openness of backyards. The Quick wins. To committee was appointed. So that. Members representing the broad community. Could take a look at this issue and make a recommendation to. Council as to what. Should be done. The committee was made up of realtors, developers. Historic preservationists and neighborhood activists. I was asked to chair their meeting and at the first meeting. We agreed to something that almost no one had ever agreed to before. And that was that we would not. Disband. Until we had reached consensus. Now think again about the group. Of people that were. Gathered. And arriving at consensus was. Clearly a challenge. The goal was to assure that larger homes could still be constructed. But the light and openness of. Backyards would. Be protected. After lengthy consideration and committee members arrived at. Consensus and quick wins to was moved to council and was passed. I urge you to support the proposal that is front in front of you tonight. Thank you for the opportunity. To talk with you. Thank you. Next up, Candace Christianson. Hi, I'm Candice Christianson of 2320 South Madison Street. I am the current UPC president right now and I was attracted to this community organization because of its outreach organization and very active members like Carolyn, who's just speaking. There's an old and strong and extremely active R.A. and it has been an advocate for and with the city and its work. We have many members who've worked citywide with you all. It traditionally works in partnership with the city, in advocating for our neighborhood as the issues arise. And when this issue was brought up to the community council, we very quickly reached out to Councilman Cashman about looking at this rezoning issue as it became as we became aware of it. As has been noted already in the presentation earlier. The PCC was active in the 2010 zoning code update and highly involved with that. We worked to get a small area plan in 2008 and were involved in the initial rezoning of this area with the long form house. And as discussed earlier, this was a part of our general meetings at three different general meetings of the neighborhood organization. We had a survey on the website, a couple of open houses. One of the reasons that I'm speaking here tonight is I live in the areas that were being considered for this rezoning. And one of the things that I want to kind of bring and draw your attention to is the idea of living within these icy canyons without access to sun exposure. One of the things that is the criteria in looking at this tonight is the public health and safety that was discussed. And as we look at work as a city to reduce our carbon, our drain on resources and reduce our carbon footprint, I think one of the things that we must consider is solar access for solar panels, heating homes, maybe even heating water and the ability to grow fruits. Vegetables have permeable surfaces, and then also just have our privacy in our backyards and have space to gather and enjoy our neighbors. Thank you so much for listening to us all tonight. Thank you. Next up, Rosemary Stauffer. And then our last three can come up to the front bench Patrick Cashion, Megan Bettinger and Jeannie Tubb. Go ahead. My name is Rosemary Stoffel and I live at 2275 South Monroe Street in University Park. We assumed that we wouldn't see more long houses in our neighborhood. After quick wins, tours passed. So we were very surprised. I only found out that two had recently been built. As far as we know, these are the only ones constructed since 2010. We initiated this rezoning effort to make sure that more are not built. Although we actively participated in the 2010 zoning code update process. We and CPD overlook the fact that the little X in the EFC would x zoned districts could be a problem. We see the removal of the X as a tweak or as one planning board member said at our public hearing the correction of a mistake. Our goal is to take away the suburban house form option and return the protections granted by quick wins to the rights given to neighbors for privacy and a sense of openness in their backyards. It is not taking away square foot square footage potential, although square footage would not be impacted in this rezoning proposal. I'd like to repeat a comment made by another planning board member that zoning is not a property right and that maximizing square footage on a parcel has never been a property right. He added that it is not a diminishment of property rights if you even get ten or 20% less floor area. He termed our proposed rezoning a thoughtful, judicious way of matching the forms with the character of the neighborhood as we Gaza City. I hope that the notion that maximum square footage equals maximum value becomes more nuanced. Our outreach, our I.R.A. outreach included a mailing to every property owner in our ESU, Dickson districts. It explained the rezoning effort and included a link to a survey on our website. We received 67 responses with 65 in favor. Councilman Cashman held two open houses with city staff, and presentations were given at three neighborhood general meetings. We appreciate CPD recognizing that this was an issue that needed tending, and thank Councilman Cashman for taking this on as a legislative rezoning. Please vote yes. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Patrick Cashin. Patrick Carson, 2160s South Milwaukee Street. I'm the chairman of the University Park. Or. Zoning Committee of the. And all I want to highlight tonight a couple of some of the zoning parameters that are evident in both the urban and suburban forums. Denver Zoning controls a lot of things, but in both of these urban districts, the footprint setbacks, which is the distance from the property line to the structure, the allowable height and the number of stories are the same. There are two important differences between the these two districts. The location of the two storey part of the structure, as you've been explained to. And this is a. Result. Of the other. Parameter which is different, which is a bulk plane. The bulk plane basically defines the building envelope for the property in the suburban district. The second floor part of the structure is actually narrower in a in a zone lot in a urban form, you can basically have a two storey structure from setback to setback in a standard 50 foot lot in the suburban form. That second floor has to be narrower. So the parameters are similar. If you have different size, lots of the lot is narrower or wider or longer. So basically all we're asking. For is a two storey part of the structure to be real allocated to the front to 65% of the lot. And I urge you to support this. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Megan Bettinger. Good evening. My name is Megan Bettinger. I live in the University Park neighborhood at 1820 South Columbine Street and have lived there for 15 years. I'm here today to speak in favor of changing the zoning code, eliminate the building of the suburban house, also known as the Longhouse. I would like to see the zoning code change from city to city. I would prefer to not have the longhouse form allowed in my neighborhood. It has the potential of impacting my privacy and my backyard enjoyment. In addition, the longhouse impacts the look and feel of my neighborhood, which I feel is already under stress due to new building and the destruction of many historical and significant homes. Is my understanding that the Urban House form restricts the two storey development to the front? 65% of the lot and requires at the rear 35% be limited to one storey, thus allowing for backyard enjoyment, sunlight and privacy. It is also my understanding that the total square footage of both home styles is similar. So given that I personally cannot see an advantage to building a longhouse as they are, it's unsightly and uninteresting in my opinion. I am in agreement with my R.A., the University Park Community Council, that the longhouse should not be allowed in the University Park neighborhood. In our fast changing city, I feel that we as its residents have a choice and how we want the city and our neighborhoods to look and feel. Allowing the building of long houses absolutely changes the charm of my neighborhood and therefore I speak in favor of eliminating the longhouse form in University Park. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Jeannie Tubb. Good evening, Jeanne Tubb. Let's give you my address to 601 South Saint Paul Street on my street. I have two houses between me and a long house. I see a two story wall over my fence. Scoring the entire length. And its two properties are between mine and the other. The neighbor next to it has an ice field in their backyard with the kids play equipment all winter long. The person on the other side with the bank of Windows have had to put in new blinds, put up a screen for their barbecue area. You can see every square inch of their house in their backyard from the longhouse with the bank of windows. She has and she's written a letter. Jody Thompkins, about the effects on them. The other side of her is another long house, and she sees the back of the longhouse. So she feels she's in a canyon between two long houses, one that takes all her privacy to windows. The other is. A two story wall with very few features. That would be more appropriate for an apartment block. The neighborliness side of it. Has really been reinforced by the fact. That I can pop my head over the fence and say, Hey, Kerri, do you want to trim this branch together? We've got this tree overhanging each other's property or he was just in hospital. How are you doing with a two storey rather long house? You have to walk around to the other side and make an effort to figure out what's going on with your neighbor, who they are. So not only does it stop the filtering of light. But that sense of community that I feel is very important to. University Park. There's a lot of. Opportunity with building and prices and scrapes that can be done to. Continue to build long houses in our neighborhood, which I feel seriously affect the character of our neighborhood. In the neighborliness, the light. Filtering through back the various backyards and the feel of the neighborhood, as well as the type of trees that can be planted with about a five foot setback. You can plant some aspen or birch, but it also affects your design of greenery. So those are some key factors that I would appreciate it if you would consider. Thank you very much. Thank you. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council? All right. Seeing no questions. A public hearing for Council Bill 380 is closed. Comments by members of Council Council in question. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm appreciate the neighbors who brought this issue forward to me. And I've sponsored the legislative rezoning in hopes of preserving and reinforcing historic patterns in the university community that make backyards urban sanctuaries, where homeowners and their families can relax in the sun and tend to the gardens that put fresh food and fresh flowers on their tables. When this was first presented to me as as Mr. Phil said, we were reminded at Planning Board that maximizing your square footage is not a zoning right. However, it was something that I wanted to understand and wanted to judge the impact. And as Pat Cashen indicated on the suburban form, while you can build two stories front to back, that second story is narrower than the first because of the bulk playing on the urban form. You get to build the full width of your second story. And so the modeling that was done shows that the square footage is is right on similar if not actually a little bit greater with with the Urban House form. I believe the proposed rezoning is in the best interests, the best long term interests of this community. It preserves the ability for families to grow and provide the space in which they can enjoy the various generations living together. And it still preserves that neighborhood character. And especially, I appreciated Janey's comments about the ability to really grow community by connection with your neighbors. So with that, I'm in full support of this rezoning and hope my colleagues will join me. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Flynn. Thanks, Mr. President. I hit the button right after you had asked me if there are any questions. I actually had a question. I don't know if you would allow that. Go ahead. Okay. And maybe Councilman Cashman could be the person to answer this. As I looked at the two building forms and read through the staff report and the presentation and the letters that accompanied it, I was wondering. It seems to me that a long house can still be built in the Urban Forum. But what you're saying is that the rear, the rear portion of the rear, 35% has to be restricted to one story. So the effect of it isn't to increase the backyard space or the lot or decrease the lot, decrease the light coverage, but to decrease the height in the rear. Am I right about that? Yeah, I don't. The term long house specifically has come to refer to those two storey homes. Build two stories front to back. The reason two to limit the growth to the construction to one story isn't so much to deal with light coverage because that's covered in other parts. Sure. But to increase privacy, since you don't have those long walls overlooking a backyard from the second story and it allows for more sunlight to filter through to the neighboring properties. Okay. So a house could still be as. Long. As an urban house could still be as long as a suburban house, but not as tall in the rear. Correct. That's my understanding. I see. Teresa. Okay. Thank you. That's the clarification I was looking for. All right. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Seeing no other comments. Madam Secretary. Raquel. Cashman. Oh, yeah. I. Black Brooks. I. Espinosa. Swain. All right. Gilmore. Herndon. Can it. Lopez. All right. New. Mr. President. Madam Secretary, please. Because voting announced the results.","A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for multiple properties located in the University Park Neighborhood between I-25 and Harvard Gulch in University Park. Approves an official map amendment to rezone properties from E-SU-Dx to E-SU-D (removes suburban home building form as an allowable use), for multiple properties in the University Park neighborhood in Council District 6. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 4-23-19.","Here is a focused professional summary of the key points from the presentation:

- This is a legislative rezoning proposal by Councilman Cashman for the University Park neighborhood to change the zoning from Urban Edge Single Unit D-X to Urban Edge Single Unit D on approximately 1,051 properties covering 183 acres. 

- The effect would be to remove the ""suburban house form"" building option that allows 2.5 story houses to be built across the full depth of the lot from front to back. 

- Instead, it would only allow the ""urban house form"" which limits the 2.5 story portion to the front 65% of the lot, with the rear 35% limited to just one story (17 feet tall).

- This aims to preserve backyard privacy, openness, and sunlight access for neighboring properties by preventing the suburban/long house style that neighbors feel is incompatible with the existing neighborhood character.

- Extensive public outreach was done including neighborhood meetings, mailings, open houses and an online survey. Strong support was received from the University Park Community Council and local residents.

- Staff finds the proposal consistent with adopted plans like Blueprint Denver by preserving the intended low-scale residential character. It furthers public welfare by implementing the neighborhood's vision.

- Planning Board unanimously recommended approval. Staff also recommends approval of this legislative rezoning to preserve the intended single-family residential patterns in University Park.",0.8375,"Your role is to comprehend presentations thoroughly through logical reasoning about the core ideas and contextual factors first, without imposing premature formatting constraints.

If I understand all these funds have been decreased from years past, if anyone's here with the prior information, you know, and then Councilwoman Ortega just wanted to point out that there's CDBG as well as 1087. I don't know if you want to consider that one as well. Typically it's just the home and the Harper fans. Okay, great. Thank you. Can you speak to the councilman's question? Yeah. So basically, do you know why 16 numbers for home Hoppa and CDBG from HUD? I do. I do. Good evening. It's Susan Lee from the Office of Economic Development. I've got the annual numbers right here, Councilman. Great. We'll start with CDBG. Last year, CDBG was 6,531,000. This year at 6 million 602. So it's actually up just a slight bit. Keep in mind, however, that the historic trend has been significantly. Down. From 2011. We're down about 17%. On the home funds, which are exclusively, of course, for housing. Last year's numbers were 2 million 363 638. This year's numbers are 2 million 362 617. So down very slightly, a few nickels and dimes. But again, for historical. Context. Since 2011, the home funds are down 38%. And lastly on Hopper, a little bit more encouraging news. Those numbers are much more stable. It's a relatively small grant. Last year was 1 million 562 737. This year it's 1,000,007, 86, 90. So it's actually up 12% this year. All right. So thank you for that information. You're welcome to sort of be aware of how the funding has changed over time.

Oh, excuse me. Resolution 318 51. Addressing the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska's Bristol Bay and urging the Trump administration to undergo the appropriate environmental review economic assessment in consultation with the public to protect the wide ranging interests in the region, including that of Seattle. Business Community Councilmember Words The floor is yours. Thank you. Council President. First, I will move to adopt resolution 31851 second. And so I'm going to I'm going to read some things into the record that may sound a bit wonky, but I do want them on the record because we did put a lot of work and worked with the advocates and thank them. Who gave us public comment here today? Because this is important. A lot of what I was going to share, the advocate shared. But I wanted to focus on one thing and then I will go into my prepared notes. I think it's important that the people here today in the city of Seattle recognize why protection of Bristol Bay is so important and relevant, not just to the Puget Sound or the Salish Sea, but the city of Seattle. We are looking at a 3.3 billion in seafood income alone in the Puget Sound. It provides, as you've heard from one of the advocates, well over 3000 jobs. And also this industry generates 580 million economic impact to the state of Washington. Also, I want to thank the mayor's office who will be signing on as I will move on later when I do the amendment to support this resolution. The Clean Water Act requires the Army Corps of Engineers to identify the least environmentally damaging, practical alternative before issuing a dredge infill permit. Pebble Limited Partnership, a mining company, intends to mine Bristol Bay, Alaska for copper and gold. It's also known as Pebble Mine. This partnership is part of Northern Dynasty Minerals, which is a Canadian based company in Vancouver. As you heard, Bristol Bay is home to the largest salmon fishery in the world. Native communities and environmental advocates in particular have a well-founded concern regarding the significant impact on the habitat and therefore the wildlife in the fishing industry that depends on a thriving habitat. The Corps contracted out to a company called AECOM, a California based engineering company, to assess an environmental impact statement. AECOM has regularly performed EIA services to and for the core Pebble Mine included in their recent mine plan investments to protect Bristol Bay to reduce environmental impacts. However, ACORN has stated they need financial information to fully determine if the company is financially capable of carrying out this massive project. On this proposed mitigation actions. The request for financial information has been denied by Dynasty Minerals. Again, Dynasty Minerals is Pebble Mine's partner in this project and the Corps have decided to continue with the permitting process anyway without getting the financial information requested by AECOM. The permit is on track for completion by January 2019. As you heard me share this morning, and you heard one of the advocates state. This project and this issue has been going on since 2008 and has also spent time in the federal courts. I take seriously the huge risk posed on the Bristol Bay Habitat, native communities, the fishing industry and consequently Seattle's economy. I'm introducing this resolution calling for a suspension on the federal permitting process to allow stakeholders an opportunity to fully evaluate the environmental and economic impact of the Pebble Mine plan. The resolution request the Office of Intergovernmental Relations Air to communicate the resolution to the federal government, including the White House, EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Department of Interior, and, of course, Senator Patty Murray. And Senator Maria Cantwell. So with that, I'm done. And then I will I will go ahead and do it, and then I will go ahead and do another adopt. Very good. So. So anybody. I didn't. If there's any if there any more discussion. A vote on the amendment. The resolution, but is there an amendment? Okay. So I have to do that too. I just want to have one of my colleagues had anything they want to say. Any other comments on the base legislation before we specifically move to the amendment? Mr. Chair. Yes, because we're a mosquito. I'm sorry. Thank you. I just wanted to echo my support for this resolution. And thank Councilmember was for bringing it forward and thank all the individuals who came forward to testify. My support for this is rooted in wanting to make sure that we protect both the environment and good living wage jobs. My family is in Homer, Alaska. My uncle and his family have been able to have a good living wage job fishing in Bristol Bay and fishing salmon every year and every year the salmon stock, it's smaller and smaller and every year the fish get smaller and smaller. We have to both protect the environment and protect the industry so that we can have good living wage jobs and we can have the ability to feed our community around the world, as you mentioned. I want to also acknowledge that this is about making sure that we think creatively about how we protect that fishing stock going forward and do everything that we can to stop this mine. When you are in Alaska, you see stickers. You see bumper stickers on almost every car saying, Stop, Pebble Mine. My Uncle Fish for many years on his fish. His boat was called the breaker because his sons were Brady and Corey, if you combine their name and now both my cousins Brady and Corey Fish in Bristol Bay every summer, this is how they now raise their two children each. And this is how they hopefully will have a good living wage job. But we have to make sure that this industry is sustainable, that we protect the environment, and that we prevent the Pebble Mine from coming in place. I believe we can do both. We can protect the environment as we protect this good living wage job industry. And hopefully future generations will have the ability to fish in this bay like my cousins currently do. Thank you, Manager. Thank you. Customer. I'm a skater. Okay, so let's just walk through the amendment first. That's an easy one, so. And I'll, I'll move. It comes from work to lighten the load a little bit. Okay, I'll move to amend the resolution 31851 by simply adding the mayor's concurrence on the be it resolved and signature lines so moved and second it to amend it as I stated all those in favor of the amendment please. What I. I oppose the ayes have it councilmember words. We want to see some closing remarks on this resolution. And I just want to say before you say that, thank you, thank you for working with the communities. There's some pretty strong language in here about conflicts of interest and what this industry means to the great state of Washington, etc.. So thank you for putting forth a I think a real significant piece of legislation comes from our worst of clause years. Thank you. Following up on what you said, council president, I very seldom do this, but I will say this on the record and looking at the legal ramifications that this has gone through, I'm very disappointed in EPA and Scott Pruitt. And of course, this isn't this decision by EPA to withdraw this respective permit when they're on track to look at these these impacts stopped in 2006 with this current administration. And I think there's something really wrong when the lobbyist for Pebble becomes the acting EPA person and that those are all political issues. This project wasn't stopped because there is scientific data or concerns or more opportunity for consultation. It was stopped for purely political purposes and sometimes things like that happened and we can sometimes work our way through them. But the damage is here to this to this area of the world we'll never get back. And so that's what I struggle with. I'm sure that's what the advocates are saying, and that is certainly what we heard from the Native American community as well. So with that, President Harrell, I moved to adopt resolution 31851 as amended. It's been moved in second. And I mean, before we vote, I want to thank members of the community for your strong testimony to advocacy as well, those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended. Please vote i. I. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries. The resolution is adopted as a minute and the chair will sign it. Thank you. Yay! Yay! Other business. Councilman Gonzalez. Thank you. I mentioned this morning during council briefing that I need to move to be excused from for council on November 5th, 2018, so that I can attend the court hearing on the consent decree. Second to move in. Second, and the Council Planning Czar be excused for the November 5th, 2018 meeting. All those in favor say I am. I oppose. The ayes have it. She is excused. Any other business coming for the council? If not, we stand adjourned. Everyone have a great rest of the day.","A RESOLUTION addressing the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay, and urging the Trump administration to undergo the appropriate environmental review, economic assessment, and consultation with the public to protect the wide-ranging interests in the region, including that of Seattle’s business community.","Here is a focused professional summary of the key points from the presentation transcript:

Report from Public Works recommendation to find that excavations are immediately required for the general health, safety and welfare of the city and provide and approve a discretionary permit to excavate in Santa Fe Avenue between Pacific Coast Highway and Willow Street Districts one and seven. Thank you, Councilman. Yes. All right. I just had a question as to the outreach. For the businesses that are out there and then what the timeline will be as to when it will begin, when it will begin. Honorable Gonzalez That's a great question. We have asked Tesoro, who was the oil company, who is the owner of this pipeline, to have a 24 hour phone line available for any questions. And also, they have told us that they will be notifying all the residents and businesses when they start or when that comes to to do this . They've told us or guaranteed us that they've done this numerous times in the last ten years, that they had no problems. The way they do it, nobody will notice it. And it has minimal impacts to all the residents and and businesses. Okay. Thank you. Councilmember, you're on. Good. In regards to frequency, though, how often does this occur? Are you talking about the frequency of the holes or half when they do this to us? Does the company go about doing this kind of project? They're telling us that they need to do this every three years. But at the same time, when they drill these half inch holes every ten feet on center, they're going to fill it with materials that it's strong enough. But also they don't need to come back and we re drill it. So they're going to use the same holes, the locations, and be able to probe it. So the material they put in will be able to to have their probes basically penetrate that material and detect their pipeline if they're sound or not. Now, should they find a major issue with any of those pipelines? Is it going to be their responsibility to either repair it and replace it or that the street would. Correct if if in doubt in a case like that, if they find that they need to repair the pipeline, they still need to get a permit from us. And in that instance, we can impose conditions to fix the street to our new standards, which is slurry sealed from curb to curb. Since this condition that they're working in doesn't constitute that. It's it's very minimal and there's no nexus. We cannot ask them to do that. But any time they open the street with any kind of trenching, then we can ask for not only to fix their pipeline, fix the trench, and also fix the pavement on top. Now, I'm assuming that you have a map of where all these pipe pipelines will go through the city, correct? Correct. So when they do their these projects, they tell you in advance what areas they're going to be going into units on some of these holes to check on their pipes. Well, they they need to have a street use permit whenever they are in the in the public quite a way to perform any type of work. The reason we are here tonight before you is because of the moratorium. These two streets had slurry seal in 2014 and paving in 2010, 2013, I believe. So they're within the five year moratorium. That's why they're here. Usually drilling a half inch hole would not constitute the staff bringing this item before you because there would be past the moratorium. But the answer to a question is yes, they will have to get a permit from us to utilize the public right away. We have to make sure that they have proper traffic control devices so traffic can go around their activities. And we approve those traffic control plans ahead of time for issuance of the permit. And that's why I'm bringing it up now to turn to the disruption that it might have in the neighborhoods and to the businesses along that strip. So. Just want to make sure that those individuals who are affected by it are well aware of what's taking place and why, so that there's not a pushback from neighborhoods and businesses that say, why are you doing this again? Especially within the within them that that period of time, that five year plan. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Thank you, Mr. Malloy. Is there any member of the public that wish to address the Council on item 18 seeing none. Members. Cast your vote. Motion carries. We had heard item 19 earlier. Is that correct? Correct.

- The city council is considering approving a permit for Tesoro, an oil company, to excavate small half-inch holes every 10 feet along Santa Fe Avenue between Pacific Coast Highway and Willow Street in Districts 1 and 7. 

- This is required to probe and check the condition of Tesoro's underground oil pipelines that run through these areas every 3 years.

- Tesoro has assured the city that this process causes minimal disruption and they have done it many times before without issues for residents or businesses.

- A 24-hour phone line will be available for any questions from the public during the work.

- If any major pipeline repairs are needed based on the probing, Tesoro would need to obtain a separate permit and could be required to repave streets per city standards.

- The council is being asked to approve this permit despite a 5-year moratorium on road work in these areas, as the small half-inch holes are considered low-impact.

- Concerns were raised about ensuring proper notification and managing potential disruption for neighborhoods and businesses along the affected streets.

- The city has maps of all pipeline locations and will require Tesoro to get permits, submit traffic control plans, and follow protocols for working in public rights-of-way.",0.8049999999999999,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, underlying context, and core intentions first through unrestricted reasoning.

I'm sorry. Where are we? 13. Mr. Ross. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. As you know, many, many of our residents throughout the city of Long Beach and throughout the state are now hit with the influenza virus. I understand that this is one of the more severe strains and many people are being adversely impacted. I wanted to bring this forward, along with Councilmember Neal, to have the health department discuss the public severity of this year's flu season, the importance of getting vaccinated, and to provide us any city resources available to to residents to stay healthy. I'd like to turn this over to staff. Thank you, Councilmember. We'll have a report from our director of Health Services, Kelly Collopy, as well as our health officer, Dr. Mitchell Kershner. Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the city council. As you probably heard, it's a big flu season and so it's not too late to get your. It's not too late to get your shot. We've had five, five fatalities in our city. And from from influenza, it's been hitting a much younger population than we've seen in the past. It's not just in older people's. It's not just hitting older people. We're finding it. You know, the median age is in the thirties. Those that are really being hit hard tend to have more underlying conditions diabetes, obesity, those kinds of things. They're showing up in our emergency rooms as the health department, we received 8000 doses from Los Angeles County of the vaccine. Of those, we distributed about 5000 to our community partners, which are nonprofits. They include organizations such as the Children's Clinic, St Mary's Mobile Clinic. And so they they provide that. They provide the shots and then they report back to us and how those shots are used. In terms of then, you know, what's available. Moving. Forward. The county or sorry, the city is providing free clinics. We are providing a free clinic this Thursday morning at the health building at 25, 25 grand. We'll be providing another free clinic Friday. Afternoon at the health building. And then on Saturday, between ten and two at Houghton Park, in conjunction with a. Affordable Care Act registration opportunity. So there are free opportunities out there. We have given over 2000 free immunizations so far. A thousand or so at the Health Department and another 1000 at other events out in the community. So we're doing our very best to bring to bring access. I do want to turn over the the time to Dr. Kushner as he's got a little bit more. About. The effectiveness of the vaccination and why it's important to get it. Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. City Council. As our director mentioned, there's been five confirmed deaths so far. And to put this in perspective, in the our influenza activity is widespread throughout California, throughout the whole state. There have been over 200 confirmed deaths of influenza in California at this point currently. Almost all the all the deaths and most of the confirmed cases of influenza have been influenza type A H1N1. This is the type A influenza that first hit the scene in 2009, 2010. The city of Long Beach had no fatalities from influenza over the last two years. Back in that season, we had a total of eight fatalities. So having five already at this point sort of points to the seriousness of the widespread activity. There are currently five ICU hospitalizations currently in our Long Beach hospitals. The H1N1 strain is included in this year's vaccine. We have started vaccinating since October of this year. We there is still plenty of flu in the state and in our city. The health department continues to offer flu vaccine. And basically, I'm urging residents that it is not too late to continue to receive the flu vaccine and to be protected. I will also say out of the five fatalities, all even though it's a younger age, as was the case in 2009, 2010, all the fatalities included younger people, but they all had underlying conditions such as diabetes , heart disease, etc.. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. And I just had a quick question, Mr. Vice Mayor, if I may. The community free clinics. Yeah. Will we be providing Felipe Reef flu shots at those clinics? Yes. Yes. The extra additional clinics that we've added at the Health Department and in Highland Park will be free and open to everyone. Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Any public comment on the item? Saying None up. Yes, go ahead, sir. Aaron. Aaron Day. Now, when I was 35 years old, and that was while I'm 74 now, I was living in Los Angeles and they had the the flu. Well, they actually had the flu going around. And I caught it. And that was the London flu. And as it turned out, you see, I didn't I didn't watch myself. And so as it turned out, 35 years of age, when I caught it, I almost died. And there was a young man across the street from me. He was 29 years old and he did pass away. Now, when I talked to a lot of people, now what I hear, hear them say is, oh, when I take that flu shot, oh, I get the you know, the reactions and all that. And so many people don't want to take that flu shot. And I know this year last year in October, when I got my flu shot, I was really feeling good that day because I felt really great. But later on that evening, I had measles and I felt really bad. So I ended up going home and slept and I slept the rest of the evening. I got up and had dinner, but then went back to bed. But I don't know. One of my brothers also, he doesn't want to take the flu shot because he still has that reaction. So I think that has to be emphasized also that, you know, some people will get that reaction. And so it's those people who don't want to take their flu shot. So that's what this economy.

Okay, let's move to committee reports. Please read the first agenda item. The report of the Governance, Equity and Technology Committee Agenda Item one Council Bill 119 427 relating to the regulation of the for hire industry, removing certain considerations between an exclusive driver representative, representative and the Director of Finance, Administrative Services and many sections 6.3 10.7 35 for code and repealing rules and regulations to the extent they are inconsistent with this ordinance. Committee recommends the bill passed. Thank you very much. I'll say a few opening words about what this bill is doing and then certainly turn it over to Councilman O'Brien, who shown your strong leadership in this area. So our goal in this legislation has always been to put the city of Seattle in the best position to address the issue of what we consider fair compensation to all TNC taxing for hire drivers without compromising the ability of these companies themselves to thrive in a competitive marketplace. In light of ongoing litigation, we are amending ordinance 124968, which provides council with most flexibility and options directly and efficiently to address the issue of driver compensation. The ordinance we passed in 2015, as many of you know, have been has been tied up in court. And our introduction of this bill, 119427, we think is common sensibly allows us to look at all options on the table regarding driver compensation without any more additional litigation delays. Again, just by way of background, in December 2015, you may recall that we passed an ordinance again under Councilmember Bryant's leadership and many of us looking at these issues relating to the regulation of the transportation and for hire industry and under which for hire drivers could determine whether or not to engage in collective negotiations over various terms with companies who contract with those drivers, examples being Uber, Lyft and and taxi companies. And among other things, the ordinance that we did pass elicited certain subjects to be collectively negotiated, including best practices relative to vehicle equipment standards, safe driving practices, criminal background checks, the nature and amount of payments made to or withheld from drivers hours and conditions of work, etc.. So I was one of the many council members who supported this. And again, the legislation today are just removing as a sub subject of bargaining the nature and amount of payments received by or withheld from drivers. There's a few other technical corrections, but nothing substantive in nature. So that's what we hope to do today. And Councilmember O'Brien, I hope I left you something to say with there. I'll turn it over to you. Council President, you did a great job of summarizing that. So you didn't leave me much to say, but I appreciate your support and strong words for this. I also support this legislation and I'll just reiterate that, that by taking this action, we still, as a body, reserve the right to to set fares and standards like we do for other parts of the industry. There's no plan at the moment to do that, but it's something that we might consider going in the future. But again, as you said, just to reiterate, this still leaves most of the terms of employment or work, I should say, for these independent contractors to be subject to the collective bargaining agreement . It just takes this one item out, as you mentioned. Very good. Any comments? I mean, our colleagues and I'll just say sort of in closing that as many of these TNC companies sort of struggle or are in many cities throughout this country and actually across the world with what a regulatory. Framework looks like. I'm really optimistic that we can figure this out in Seattle. What's fair to both the drivers, those, whether the part time or full time and to the companies themselves to allow competitive choices that we could figure out what a healthy regulatory scheme looks like here. And and again, maybe other cities in this country could sort of follow our lead. And that's the work we're going to do this year. And I look forward to it. So. Can I just ask question about the schedule? What do you anticipate and when do you think we would have something for review? Yeah, I know I should have talked that much and I was going to keep the question. I'm optimistic that first quarter this year we'll be firing up the committee and looking at these issues. We're still struggling with some issues on how to get some of the data that we want and the executives on board also assisting us , trying to get data on the types of rides and the number of rides in certain areas of the city, because there are other issues in addition to the composition of the drivers that we're concerned about with how our streets look. So but I anticipate first quarter of this year, we'll be doing some work on it. Okay. Having said that, please call the role on the passage of the bill. Make sure. Johnson Whereas O'Brien President Harrell five in favor nine opposed the. Bill passed and show sign it please read the next agenda item. The report on the Sustainability and Transportation Committee Agenda Item to cancel 119 415 relating to city streets. The committee recommends the bill pass.",AN ORDINANCE relating to the regulation of the for-hire industry; removing certain considerations between an exclusive driver representative and the Director of Finance and Administrative Services; amending Section 6.310.735 of the Seattle Municipal Code; and repealing rules and regulations to the extent they are inconsistent with this ordinance.,"Here is a focused professional summary of the key points from the presentation transcript:

- The legislation removes consideration of the ""nature and amount of payments made to or withheld from drivers"" as a subject for collective bargaining between transportation network companies (TNCs) like Uber/Lyft and their drivers.

- This amends a 2015 ordinance that allowed TNC drivers to collectively bargain over various terms of their work, including payments, hours, equipment standards, etc. 

- The change is made in light of ongoing litigation over the 2015 ordinance, giving the city more flexibility to directly address fair driver compensation issues without additional court delays.

- However, most other terms of TNC driver work arrangements can still potentially be subject to collective bargaining negotiations.

- The council hopes this legislation will put Seattle in the best position to establish a balanced regulatory framework that provides fair compensation for TNC drivers while still allowing the companies to operate competitively.

- Work on developing a full regulatory approach for TNCs, including potential payment standards, is anticipated to ramp up in the first quarter of 2019.

- Key contextual factors include struggles nationally over how to properly regulate the emerging TNC industry, lack of comprehensive data on Seattle TNC operations, and concerns over street impacts beyond just driver issues.",0.0,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, underlying context, and core intentions first through unrestricted reasoning.

Greg Morrow, Director of Community Corrections. So other than these appointments tonight, are there any other vacancies that will be coming up in the immediate future? Yes, Councilwoman.

We do have four vacancies on the Community Corrections Board aside from the ones before council tonight. Okay. And if you could highlight whether Romain, if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself. Good evening. Romaine Pacheco, director of Boards and commissions and community outreach for the mayor. So of the four vacancies that are still yet to be filled, are there specific categories that need to sort of be checked off in order to appoint people to those seats? Yes, Councilwoman Ortega, the ordinance is prescriptive in terms of who it is that can serve on the Community Corrections Board. We actually have two vacancies currently. There are two other appointments that have been made that are awaiting the process through city council. But currently we have a vacancy for a representative from Denver Public Schools. The other is for an expert in criminal justice. Okay. And the two that are pending. What are those categories? Representatives from the Department of Safety and a local elected official. Okay. And local elected doesn't mean somebody serving on this body. It means somebody that can be serving in the state legislature. That is correct. Okay, great. I have no further questions. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. And I believe before we go too far down the path of questions, I need a clarification either from legal or our Madam Secretary over there. Right now should only be debating the postponement. Take the vote on the postponement, and then we can ask questions if it's not postponed. About the actual board and and things. So right now only discussion on whether to postpone or not. To re refer. Correct? I'm sorry. I keep saying postpone to re refer. So. So. Okay, so. That was helpful to me to know how to vote. So that's why. Just to clarify, before we get too far down the rabbit hole, these are discussion on the postponement, not on the bill. Councilwoman CdeBaca, you back up. No, no, no. Okay. All right.

Okay. Hold on. There's been a motion in a second. Councilmember Mongo. First, I want to thank our department and our city management for looking after the the health needs of our employees and their families. This is a very, very important matter. I think what's also an important matter is for us as a city to acknowledge that this is a $4.2 million annual increase over last year, according to staff reports that I've been reading. And if I'm incorrect in that, I'd be glad to be corrected. But with that, I'd like to see in the next several months that the Budget Oversight Committee start looking at this in advance of two weeks before our October enrollment. Both cost to employees and the city have increased over time, and we've shared that. And I think that we need a more comprehensive discussion about what options we have and what can be done. In six years we've experienced a $9.3 million increase, but in this last year, we've experienced a $4.2 million increase, and this only covers approximately 3900 employees in the city at this time. And so I think we just need to have a good amount of time in committee to discuss that. And so if council that the Vice Mayor Lowenthal is open to that, I'd like to request of the Human Resources Department city manager's office to prepare a report with the historical data and options that we have to ensure whether it's healthy lifestyle plans for our employees or Biggest Loser projects that other cities and counties have taken on to reduce those ongoing costs over time. I think this is a very important matter and needs to be discussed. It is $4.2 million increase, and I think that that's a big component that wasn't that wasn't put in the fiscal impact as much as you have to do the research to find that. So. But thank you for providing all the information. I think you've got an excellent job and a thorough job to be able to get to this point, to start the discussion. And I'd hope that Councilmember Lowenthal would take that on. Thank you. Councilmember Price. On that note, it does seem that, you know, the data that Councilmember Mongeau and I are referring to looks like it spans a period of time starting in 2009 until the president going into 15. And it looks like at some points there was a rise in the costs and at some point a decline. Can you, Ms.. Mills, maybe can you comment on what it is that is the cause of the current increase? Yes. Well. We have two plans. One is a PPO plan, which is a self-funded plan, and the second is an HMO plan, which is a fully insured plan. So on a fully insured plan, of course, we simply pay the rates to the provider. On the self-insured plan, we can have some variation from one year to the next, depending on how many large claims we might have. So that can have some impact. I would also say to speak to Council member Mungo's question. We do. And Cheryl is actually pointing out to me the Affordable Care Act could account for about was it 12.7? Or. 4.8% of the increase is actually the Affordable Care Act. So there are a lot of fees and. Taxes that the city is required to pay. And those were all folded in on the HMO side and the PPO side into the rate. So that accounts for some of the increase this year. And then we we do have a wellness program that's built into our plan. So we're certainly very mindful of trying to help our employees be more healthy and all in an effort to reduce cost. In the case of the prescription drug plan, one of the highest increases is prescription drugs, those specialty drugs. So we've put some plans in place in order to monitor those and make sure that they're being used in the best way possible and most cost efficient possible. But we can certainly provide a lot of detailed information on the plans. Dr. Bronson. Yes. I wanted to follow up on all those questions. I think your remarks were were pretty much on point. Councilmember Mongeau, I understand that the rising cost of health care has been a problem or been an issue for municipal government for many, many years. What I guess the question for staff is with this plan, what is the projected increase in the term of this current agreement? Generally there is that there's a built in factor of X percent a year of cost going up or down. Is that that factored in here in any way? Cheryl murray, our h.r. Officer will answer that. For the projected cost for the increase on the benefits plan for this year, the increase is roughly about 4 to 6% increase. Okay. And what does that mean in real dollars? In real dollars, as she stated, it has gone up from last year, approximately $4 million. Okay. And is is. And we understand under the Affordable Care Act, cost were supposed to stabilize. We re experiencing that at any way. We haven't gotten to the stabilization portion yet. We are required to pay the bakery fees, which we have done for the last two years, last year and this year. Coming up in 2016, we will be responsible for paying a reinsurance fee that's incorporated into our rates. Thank you so much. Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal. I wanted to refer back to Councilmember Mango's comment, and I would be open to having that in the budget oversight. Is that a request to the makers of the motion to add that report? I wouldn't add it to the motion at this time, but more just a friendly request. I know that you manage the agenda of that committee. I would like to pass the item as it is in line. So we will go ahead and add that to the Budget Oversight Committee agenda. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. I don't have anything. I apologize. Any public comment on this item? See, now there's a motion on the floor. Please cast your votes. Councilman Andrews. Motion carry seven zero. Thank you. Next item.","Recommendation to authorize City Manager to execute the renewal of contracts with Anthem Blue Cross, the City’s Third Party Administrator for the Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and the Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) group health plans and Medicare Supplement plan; United Healthcare Medicare Advantage Plan; Scan Health Plan for the Medicare Advantage Plan; Delta Dental for the fee-for-service dental plan (DPPO); Medical Eye Services (MES) for the vision plan; CVS Caremark as the Prescription Benefit Manager (PBM) for the Prescription Drug Plan; Standard Insurance Company for life insurance and Long- and Short-Term Disability; and Union Mutual Life Insurance Company (UNUM) through Larry Lambert & Associates Insurance Services for the long-term care benefits; execute a contract with Delta Dental for the closed-panel dental plan (DHMO); and any subsequent amendments necessary to maintain current benefit levels and remain in compliance with state and federal laws on all plans.

The presentation covered the recommendation to renew contracts with seven healthcare providers to maintain current benefit levels for the city's health, dental, vision, prescription, and disability plans covering approximately 3,900 employees. The key points raised were:

1. Cost Increase: The renewal represents a $4.2 million (4-6%) annual increase over the previous year, contributing to a $9.3 million increase over the past 6 years. 

2. Cost Drivers: Major factors driving the increase include requirements under the Affordable Care Act (estimated 4.8% of the rise), higher costs for the self-funded PPO plan due to large claims, and rising specialty drug prices in the prescription plan.

3. Cost Mitigation: The city has wellness programs aimed at improving employee health to reduce costs. It is also monitoring specialty drug utilization for cost efficiency.

4. Further Review: Council members requested a comprehensive report examining historical cost data, projected future increases under this renewal, and potential options like employee wellness initiatives to manage the rising healthcare expenditures more proactively going forward.

The council approved the contract renewals 7-0, while also directing the Budget Oversight Committee to schedule a detailed review of healthcare costs and cost-containment strategies.",0.7400000000000001,"Approach each presentation by thoroughly reasoning about the core ideas, logical flow, and contextual factors first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Agenda item one accessible 119 451 really into land use and zoning w a moratorium on the filing, accepting acceptance, processing and or approval of applications for development in areas currently used as mobile home parks, declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date all by three fourths vote of the City Council . And I apologize. I was not clear on my order of the agenda. Councilmember Swan, you have the floor. Thank you, Bruno. And and let me just say, I don't blame you all for not knowing that there was not the legislation because this is parliamentary procedure. Why would you know it unless you absolutely have to? And even then, it can be very confusing. Thank you. So everybody who's been paying attention to the question of the al-Shabaab mobile home crisis knows what this is about. But I just want to do share to do a three quick stories of what we've heard from our community members at Halcyon. And one of them is Renny Hagan, who's a retired bartender and member of Unite Here, a local aid, who told us about being homeless for years, having lived in a tool shed with no heat or electricity or running water before finding a home at Halcyon, where she now tends a garden and grows vegetables for her neighbors. She told us she would likely be homeless again if the developers succeeded in evicting the mobile home owners. And she says, for seven years I've had the security without worry, and now they're going to take it away. Eloise MIKKELSON, whom you heard from just now, is the retired machinist and member of the Machinists Union, is a painter , musician and grandmother who has lived at Halcyon for 16 years. She says this is a caring community. We look out for one another. Some of us really would have no other place to go. You heard from Wesley Shearer, a former Teamster, who is raising a granddaughter who has special needs. Halcyon is a neighborhood where Wesley and his family feel safety and trust, he says. Help save our community because that's all we have. We know that what happened, as the committee members have said, was this property went on the market for $22 million. Garland based corporate developer named Blue Fawn filed pre-application. The residents have known about this because they got letters in the mail and they got organized. They got they contacted my office and we had an incredibly moving committee meeting on Friday, January 18th, where we had all these testimony and well, not only the residents, but so many of their supporters, some of whom we spoke to, they demanded that council take action. As it was said earlier, this demonstrates what you can accomplish by building a movement. And when that movement has its own voice in City Hall, this is what you can accomplish. You can actually win victories. And let me just say also, it is nice that Yudof is now saying that they will ask you as bank to sell the property to someone who wants to rent it, run it as a mobile home park. But the residents of Halcyon, as those of us who have fought for housing justice for years, no talk is cheap. The residents were promised that their homes wouldn't be saved in the past, but then they were surprised by a notice on their doors last fall, saying that the park was being sold. So we know that we know not to trust empty words. We know we have to continue fighting right the way. And we also know that because of our activism, Blue Farm, that developer has backed off for now. But we know better than to take promises and intentions at face value when a 22 million property sale is on the line. So if you have intent to keep this property as a mobile home park, then they will have no problem with council passing legislation for flowing from this moratorium to designate this region, this property with the manufactured home park designation. And as we've said before, Seattle will not be the first city doing this. The city of Portland has already done that. The Portland City Council unanimously voted last summer to do have a manufactured home mobile home park designation. They are mobile home park communities because there was a widespread demand from from ordinary people. Let's preserve for existing affordable housing. I want to do first of all, I want are a lot of people talking, but I wanted to first of all, congratulate the residents of Halcyon themselves. Can you please give yourself a big hand? And look at this Seattle Times cover page. This. This my dear friend and fellow activist. This is a testimonial to the kind of power you can build. When we get organized collectively and this has happened because we did that not because any one person championed your cause, but you do need your own voice. As at City Hall, as Linda Chase in the article says, there are million there are a million sites where developers can build. There are only two mobile home parks in the city. This is housing for people who don't have a lot of money. This is working class housing. Let's preserve it. And as HBO, they can said in the article, it shouldn't take a crisis for you to do something. It shouldn't take people with gray hair crying on your shoulders while these people with gray hair are done crying. They are now fighting. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien, for agreeing to co-sponsor the legislation. Thanks. Thanks also to Kendall Freeman and Denver Doan, who did a lot of the work on this and also getting arrested as usual, the council's central staff director. Special thanks to Nick Jones from my office, who spent a lot of time with you all. He's right there. And Jonathan Rosenblum and Saja Soma. And I wanted to join the others who have already said in thanking Unite here. Local eight OPIO Local eight. I am Local 751. The Puget Sound Advocate for Retirement Action, the Vietnamese Seniors Association, Trinity Methodist Church, the Faith Action Network. Reverend Angela Yang of the Bethany United Church of Christ. So many spoke in support of the preservation of this affordable housing. I really thank everybody. I also want her to know that not Paul Bergman is your long time member of the labor movement who's been here at every meeting with you all. You have a lot of support, but let's not stop here. Let's win this moratorium and let's make sure we keep fighting. I do have some closing remarks at the end before we take the vote. Very good. Thank you, guys, from Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. Councilmember Swan, thank you so much for your leadership on this. But I really want to give so much credit to the residents of Halcyon for your work to make this possible. In addition to everything that Councilmember Simon said, we have a lot of work to do to protect the remaining two mobile home or manufactured home parks in Seattle. And we have a lot of work to do to ensure that we have enough affordable housing for everyone in our city who needs it. And one of the things that you reminded us all again in your testimony today and last week was this is not just about housing. This is not just about a roof in a wall, but it's about community. And the power of your community has really showed up in amazing ways. And as we continue to build more and more affordable housing, we need to make sure that we're also creating spaces where communities, powerful communities like yours can form, because that's what we need in our city. So thanks for your leadership and work. Unless you're any other comments on the base legislation. I believe Councilmember Johnson has an amendment and we could come back to the base legislation for comments as well. So, Councilmember Johnson, you'd like to describe your amendment. Thanks. Appreciate that. Council president. As my colleague saw this morning, and for the benefit of the public who've heard this a couple of times, I'll just repeated the amendment that I'm bringing forward this afternoon would make a change to the fifth section of this bill, and it would insert two key concepts. The first concept is that a set of recommendations will be developed by the Office of Planning and Community Development and the Department of Construction and Inspections about what a set of long term proposals could look like for something beyond the moratorium that is being proposed today. And secondly, that that legislation will be transmitted to the committee that has jurisdiction over it, which is currently the planning land use and zoning committee. So those are the two substantive changes to the amendment. I'm happy to answer questions, but I know that our clerk would like me to read the official movement into the records that we have this official in front of us and that I will do. Now I move to amend Council Bill 119451 by substituting Section five as presented on the proposed amendment in front of you. Second, as. A council member, Johnson has been moved on. Second has made the amendment. Are there any questions? Just on the amendment only. Any questions on the amendment? Or would you like say, any closing remarks on the amendment? Councilman Johnson Councilmember comes from words or some remarks comes from awareness. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank Councilor Swan and her staff for bringing this very important issue to city council. And I also want to thank Councilmember Johnson for working with me on doing the making this this amendment. I am proud to co-sponsor this amendment. And I also want to thank, of course, the residents and the 47 people that showed up today and on January 22nd to let us know about the concerns about what goes on in the manufactured home mobile park. Some of the comments that I'm making now I made this morning, and we want you to know that we understand how important it is for this city council, any legislative authority to look at protecting the stock of homes that is manufactured homes in mobile parks, and that we know how important it is that we protect the use of such property. We had an opportunity to look at the law and run these issues by law. We had an opportunity to review the legislation to protect the use of such property over 30 years ago. We had an opportunity to look at the Lynnwood model and the Tumwater ordinance and to understand how the federal courts have upheld the city's rights, the legislative rights to protect the use of such property. Our goals here today are to address the lack of housing for our elders, disabled and marginalized communities. We believe that this is an emergency. Things today are not like they were 30 years ago. Obviously, I think it's important that the people that showed here today, particularly the residents, that this has never been a us against them attitude. This has always been about that we care that we want to know the facts, we want to the legal posture, and we also want to know where we are on solid ground to make sure that it isn't just a moratorium, but that we work towards protecting the land and its use. I want to share that something today that I read and actually last night. And I thought about you folks. You know, being on this job, you make difficult decisions. But this was not a hard one for any of my colleagues, quite frankly. But I want to share a quote, and it's really important for me to share this. Democracy cannot survive in a swamp of mutual contempt. I don't know. This country can survive if we all continue to despise each other. You don't have to change your mind about something. You don't even have to like me. You just have to realize that the person you're talking to is a human being. And sometimes we don't do that. So this issue today has always been about being supportive of particularly our elders. I've been at the Halcyon Park. My staff has been out there. Your circumstances have never been lost on us. And so again, I want to thank Councilmember Swan and her staff. I want to thank, more importantly, the residents. I know US chartered busses to come down here. I want to thank my staff who did all the research and the University of Washington, the people that we spoke to, to make sure we understood. I want to thank Legal for giving us the analysis that we need to make sure that we can make a sound decision that lasts. And, of course, I want to thank my colleagues that have come into my office to ask questions of. Councilmember Bagshaw was out there Saturday, I believe. And you really do have a council that cares. So thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Whereas. But I want to address just the amendment right now. There's been an amendment and it's been second. And I'm going to call on that vote. Would you like to see some more words on that concern? Just briefly, you know, I want to offer that as part of public testimony was mentioned, that people are going to be keeping a close eye on me and my committee. And when we're planning to take this up, it's our intention stated in this proposed amendment that we ask for a preliminary list of options to be delivered by April. So if in case people aren't clear enough that we're keeping this as a front burner issue, we're expecting at least a draft list of recommendations to come to us in April with the goal of adopting something before the end of our sort of policy calendar year, which is generally in the September or so time frame. And that's going to include a broad list of options. Many folks have talked about the Portland model, which allows for current property owners to transfer their development rights to other properties. There have been lots of discussions about the access to funds out of Olympia for people to be able to purchase the the land that they sit on for what would effectively be a home ownership opportunity, an edge away type situation. There's a lot of options available to us, so we're going to be discussing this more and looking for recommendations coming as soon as April. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. Okay. So it's been moved on second. And all those in favor of the amendment as articulated by Councilmember Johnson, please say I, I, all the polls say no live. The ayes have it. So now we are back to our base. Legislation as amended would come from our backs. I'd like to say a few words. A quick thank you to all of you. I did get a chance to visit on Saturday again, and I just want to very respectfully say thank you for coming and putting your arms around each other because you've created a caring community that really is a. Model for others. And I'll be honored to be. Voting yes for this moratorium and working with Councilmember Johnson to find the options that will really protect you long. Term. Thank you, Councilman Bagshaw. Consumer. Herbold Thank you. Just really quickly, I want to just sort of give a nod to your vigilance as somebody who used to herself be an organizer with the tenants union, as Ashfield Dickens was once. And I think Reverend Rich Campbell, I don't know if he's still in the room, was a founder of the tenants union. Vigilance is really important. And a lot of times, so many times the folks who are out there in the community in this case, in in your community or in other cases in apartment buildings, really know more about what's going on than than city government does. And so we really rely on you and your expertize and what you're hearing on the ground from your property managers or or from what what you're seeing from talking to one another. I think that's really important. And thank you, because it's really what's. Allowed us. To act. If it if it was not for your vigilance, we would actually be very limited in how we could act if this had gone on much further. So thank you. Thank you. Okay. I will say a couple of comments and then Councilmember Swan and ask that you close the debate on the issue. I'll simply say, number one, thank you. Thank you very much. I think that your story has resonated throughout the city, and I think that the entire city sort of looked at what you're going through and what you shouldn't have to go through. So I'm I'm excited about the discussions that will take place in a Councilmember Johnson's committee. I also heard that there was a park that has not been kept up to the standards that should be kept and some other things. And so I'm going to anticipate that during our budget deliberations, we'll also look at not just fighting for status quo, but what we can do to be a better partner to you. You are fine residents and fine Seattle folks, and so it's our honor to work with you. Thank you again. Thank you, Councilmember Swan, for your leadership in bringing this to the city's attention. And with that comes from everyone, please close the debate. Mr. President, may I make a comment? Oh. I. Timing is always off. But, Councilmember, I'm a skater. Thank you. I'm sorry, ma'am. Thank you. And I know council members won't want to close. I'll just say a few words. You know, I want to lift up some of the comments that Councilmember Johnson also mentioned in terms of the longer term vision, as we work on a comprehensive plan, it must be comprehensive for every family, for every retiree, for every artist , for every activist in Seattle, so that we have affordable housing for those who are currently here or those who've retired here, and for future families who we want to welcome here as well. I think this conversation today is just another reminder that we need to make sure that we're not only investing in more rent restricted, affordable rental units, but that we're creating more affordable homeownership options for everyone, including mobile units, including first time homebuyer options, including the ability to turn apartments like mine into our first time homebuyer options, and creating more affordable units as we create solutions to address the restrictive zoning that has limited our ability to have homeownership options. I think that we at the city level have been pushing our friends at the state level as well to get additional revenue in hand so that we can build quickly and respond more effectively to the fact that we don't have enough housing in the city, housing for our lower income and working families. And we don't have the opportunity to have lower cost homeownership options through affordable condominiums. This has resulted in people getting pushed into the streets and being people getting pushed out of our city. So I look forward to working with all of you as we talk about scaling up the type of housing that we can create in our city, scaling up to make sure that we're more inclusive city, creating more affordable housing for all working families, and that we look at this through a holistic approach to make sure that we are not responding parcel by parcel, but that we have public policies that reflect the values that working families and retirees ought to be able to live in the city. I'll also be working with you as we respond to the question of why the good sister who just left. She asked, Why are we in the situation where we don't have enough affordable housing in the city? And part of the reason why is because we've been we've had our hands tied for far too long with restrictive lawsuits and dragging seats. We have not been able to respond to the crisis of housing and homelessness. And I think what you're seeing here is not just a response to, say, protect the existing housing, but actually make sure that we have permanent, affordable housing for everyone. So let's make sure that this is the impetus that we need, as someone said, so that there's not an island of affordable housing in the mix of expensive housing and that we actually create affordable housing throughout the city. I'm excited to work with you on some of the pieces that Councilmember Johnson mentioned regarding transfer rights, regarding home away opportunities, and I'm going to be introducing legislation in the next few months that will be the tenant opportunity to purchase act so that when apartments like mine get sold while I'm living there, we get notification so that we can have the opportunity to come together and purchase together and we can have access to those resources to make sure that folks have the opportunity to stay in place so that we can afford our homes. I'm really excited to work with you on all types of affordable housing and to to use this as the impetus for longer term, more robust solutions across our city. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can someone get a counselor on this one? Thank you. So we we know that we have come this far to win the moratorium, but as you yourself have said, that is not going to be enough. We need to make sure that the manufactured home park zoning designation goes through and that is not going to be automatic. We are going to have to fight for it. And let me tell you, I've been I've been through this routine many, many times in five years now, where it starts a fight, the fight for some sort of justice, whether it's housing, justice, rent or just as a workers, justice starts with ordinary people demanding it. One or two councilmembers supporting it. A lot of you know. Pushback from a lot of corporate politicians, but when they recognize they cannot, then it's all where we always wanted it. So let's be very clear that we are not going to have to we're not going to be able to stop fighting just because we hear a lot of grand speeches today. We know what we're up against. We're up against a city hall that is primarily still let's let's be sober and not complacent, primarily still dominated by politicians who are, you know, serving corporate interests for the most part, and then are pushed into doing the right thing. So let's make sure that we keep building our movement to do the right thing. I really thank the Association of Manufactured Home Owners. I specifically wanted to thank Island Park for all the organizing effort she has done. Not just but Colin, not just in this battle, but you've all already fight fought a lot of battles. And I really urge you all to continue your work in forming your own homeowner's association. In reality, this homeowner's association will be like a branch of the tenants union because you are fighting for working class home ownership, similar, similar to tenants union, fighting for the rental rights of working class people. I really wanted to also thank the Tenants Union and by Seattle and Devon Southern Air who spoke, which really shows that we need to unite our working people, whether they are homeowners or renters. We need to unite us. We need to get united because our enemy is not each other. Our enemy is a corporate developer dominated city, a billionaire dominated city, as Imogene said. And also the fact is that, you know, a lot of politicians will talk about humanity while whose humanity gets lost in all of this. The humanity of ordinary people gets lost. Because when we lose our affordable housing, when we lose our rights, it's our humanity that is put to the test and that, you know, put to question. And that's why we should continue fighting. We should not apologize for fighting because that is the right thing to do. And let's wear it like a badge of honor. But any of my I was going to close debate. But implicit in your comments were, I think, baseless insults. If anyone liked to respond to it, I'll I'll let you respond. Otherwise, I'll just call for the vote. So. Okay, so we're going to call for the vote. Please call the role on the passage of the amended Bill. Herbold II. Johnson Suarez Macheda I O'Brien sir want. I. Beg John President Harrell all right.

This City Council meeting focused on passing emergency legislation to impose a moratorium on development applications for two remaining mobile home parks in Seattle, in order to preserve this critical source of affordable housing. Several mobile home park residents provided powerful testimony about how these communities provide a caring, supportive environment and affordable homes for retirees, disabled individuals, and working families. 

Councilmember Kshama Sawant championed this legislation after residents organized when a $22 million sale was announced that threatened to displace them. While celebrating this grassroots movement victory, Sawant emphasized the need for further permanent protections like a manufactured home park zoning designation. 

An amendment was passed to require recommendations by April on long-term solutions beyond the moratorium, such as options used in other cities to facilitate resident ownership. Other councilmembers affirmed their commitment to preserving affordable housing and empowering communities.

However, Sawant cautioned that continued activism would be needed, as the council remains influenced by corporate interests. She urged residents to stay united with broader tenants' rights movements to fight for the rights and humanity of working people against profit-driven displacement.

In the end, the amended moratorium bill passed by an 8-1 vote after robust discussion on both immediate protection and developing more comprehensive affordable housing policies for Seattle's communities.",0.0,"Approach each presentation by thoroughly reasoning about the core ideas, logical flow, and contextual factors first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Only answer preceding resolution 28885 to the extent inconsistent committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Casmir Muscovite, you are the sponsor of this resolution and are recognized to address this item. Thank you, Madam President. This resolution moves us towards a goal that I have been asking for since becoming budget chair. And I think it's really important that we look at the details in the proposal that was sent down. I want to thank Council Member Herbold for flagging this in our earlier conversations as well. One really important thing that you will see here is the amendments that we have made to Resolution 31954. Each year the council goes through a budget process, and even years like this one, we endorse a budget for the auditor. This provides some guidance, but no concrete stability to departments. I'm really looking forward to making sure that we provide concrete, transparent, accountable information that can go between branches of government and can be shared with the public to flesh out a process in the next few months here that I hope will work for long term planning and long term stability as we seek greater outyear forecasting to allow for the Council to deliberate on items in front of us so that we can make sound financing, sound financing decisions, in particular during this economic downturn that we're in. Moving towards a shorter budgeting process makes sense to be able to do a truly reflective two three to truly reflect economic conditions. But we also must continue to have biannual budgets and seek further analysis for outyear conversations around our budgeting to ensure stability and transparency with the public. Those are the amendments that we've included today. Appreciate all of your support on that and look forward to working with you as we finalize details on what that process will look like. Thank you so much, Councilmember Musketeer, for that description of this particular resolution. Are there any other comments on the resolution? Councilmember Verbal, please. Thank you. I really appreciate Jerry Mesquita for bringing forward her amendment. This amendment address my concerns about the diversion proposed by the mayor to not just establish a one year process for 2021, but also repeal the resolution that was adopted back in 1994 to establish a two year budget process. A two year budget process provides counsel and the public greater transparency, as well as a better opportunity to plan for four out years. So keeping that as the default process makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the focus on and Councilmember Morales I'm sorry, customer mosquitoes amendment on increasing transparency for both the council and the public. And I also want to give a shout out to central staffer Tom Meisel. I know the he wrote a budget a budget issue paper on this. And I definitely appreciated the analysis that he did that made me think twice about the the mayor's resolution. And I lost track of it. The good work that he had done in that in that budget issue paper. And again, really appreciate chair Ms.. Ada bringing it back before us. Thank you. Thank you.

The city council was considering Resolution 31954 related to the city's annual budget process. The main objectives were:

1. Move towards a one-year budget proposal for 2021 instead of the typical two-year budget cycle. This would allow the budget to better reflect current economic conditions during the downturn.

2. However, maintain the default of biennial (two-year) budget cycles going forward to provide stability, transparency and better long-term planning abilities. 

3. Increase transparency and opportunities for the council and public to have input into the multi-year budget forecasting process.

The reasoning behind these initiatives included:

- Adapting the 2021 budget timeframe to the volatile economic situation.
- But preserving the two-year budget model long-term for stability and robust analysis of out-year impacts.
- Facilitating coordination between the executive and legislative branches on budgeting.
- Allowing the council to deliberately consider long-range financial decisions.

Relevant context:

- Councilmember Mosqueda, the budget chair, sponsored this resolution aligning with her priorities.
- Herbold raised initial concerns about deviating from two-year budgets, addressed by amendments.
- Council staff analysis informed members' perspective on the budget process changes.

After discussion, the amended resolution passed 8-0, allowing a transparent one-year 2021 budget within the preserved biennial budget framework.",0.8761904761904762,"Approach each presentation by thoroughly reasoning about the core ideas, logical flow, and contextual factors first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Yes, we discussed this when this bill came to committee, and I guess we didn't.

But what this does is require that reports from the Department of Excise and license are brought back to City Council on how this common consumption program is working. It's expected to be a sort of a pilot program for several years, and if there were major problems by seeing the reports, it would allow us to address any of those issues immediately.

The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 10-23-19.","Here is a concise summary capturing the main objectives, proposed initiatives, reasoning, and relevant context from the presentation:

The City Council meeting addressed Council Bill 19-1110 related to establishing an entertainment district with a common consumption area licensing program. The key points were:

Objectives:
- Adopt Council Bill 19-1110 to create an entertainment district pilot program allowing open consumption of alcohol in designated areas. 

Proposed Amendment:
- Councilwoman Ortega proposed an amendment to require the Director of Excise and Licenses to provide annual written reports to City Council by April 15th each year starting 2021, detailing the operation of the entertainment district and common consumption licensing program.
- This allows monitoring the pilot program's progress and immediately addressing any major issues that arise.

Reasoning:
- The entertainment district is expected to operate as a pilot for several years initially. Requiring annual reports to Council enables oversight and the ability to make adjustments if needed based on how the program functions.

Relevant Context:
- Clarification from Councilman Flynn that the proper motion was to order the bill published, not adopted initially.
- Procedural discussion on rescinding the initial motion before the amendment vote per Robert's Rules.  
- The amendment passed with 13 ayes.
- The final motion to order Council Bill 19-1110 published as amended also passed with 13 ayes.

The Seattle City Council addressed Agenda Item 4, which was Council Bill 119077 regarding the Capitol Hill Housing Improvement Program. This program, chartered by the City of Seattle, previously could only operate affordable housing projects within Seattle itself. 

The approved bill allows the program's director to enter into agreements permitting it to pursue affordable housing projects outside Seattle, in other cities and areas of King County. For several listed cities like Bellevue and Federal Way, the director can directly make these agreements. For unlisted cities, the Council must first adopt a resolution allowing the director to enter an agreement for that specific city.

My name is Stephanie Geller, Brant Serra. I am your administrative services director. And first of all, would you like an update on the score? Yeah, it's 98 to 79 with 3 minutes left to play. Is that us? Yes. Oh, so just had to get. That off sometimes. Those last 3 minutes. Those last. 3 minutes. But it's a 19 point game. So go warriors anyway. I know you all expected to see Paul Comer here tonight. He has a grievous and tragic family emergency that he had to attend to today. And we're all keeping him in our thoughts. Meanwhile, I'm here today to kind of go over some of the things that he shared with me. He very much wanted to discuss with you the recruitment process that he had envisioned for the city manager, recruitment for you all. And and also take some input regarding the attributes you would all like to see in your next city manager. Now, because he could not be here tonight, he would like to schedule individual meetings with all of you to take your individual input. But to. Council. Member de song. Point of order you might want to. When you ask us for attributes, give us, you know, indications as to what we are not technically allowed to legally allowed to say in terms of attributes. Well, certainly so. That is sexual harassment. Training, by the way, is scheduled for June 30th of this month. The same with women. Oh. And and your discrimination training and bias training. That is actually this month, coincidentally. But absolutely, we would like to to stay clear of any attributes that would steer towards any bias in race, sex, age, any protected classifications, including disabilities. And we're looking for specifically experience and focus education requirements, perhaps that sort of nature. And again. Mr. Camara would like to meet with all you all individually to discuss this, but this is your opportunity to to speak with one another. And so I wanted to make sure that you had that opportunity tonight. I would also. There is a recruitment process, timeline I did that was made available to you, I believe. If it's not, I can go over that with you. It's pretty basic. What he had envisioned was to discuss with all of you sort of your vision of what is what you would like to see in the brochure. The brochure is actually just a marketing tool. There's not a lot of words in it, but it's a it's a very targeted document. And the council input is needed to identify and highlight the most important operational, financial, strategic priorities for the position. And the most critical candidate attributes is what he had stated. He would also like to have a town meeting before the brochure is collected and and the h.R. Staff is going to assist him in that endeavor and we can schedule that. The last piece of the public outreach before the brochure is actually printed is a survey via SurveyMonkey and an example that was provided to you. And if you would like to make any comments or corrections on that, you can let me know or you can. I believe that there's there was a copy given to you and it's pretty basic. It's just basically discusses what a council, what a city manager's main priorities, what they want the priorities to be. And that is going to be posted on our website and until the actual recruitment closes. So it's not only going to be used for the development of the brochure, but it will stay open. The survey will stay open until the actual recruitment closes so that you can take a take a sort of a gander at what the what the public saying about what they want to see in their city manager. When you get to the selection process, after the brochure is printed and distributed for a certain period of time, their firm will then collect the data. And they were they'll go they will sort of make lots of recommendations on who they think are the top candidates. In addition, what we have done in the past and what we recommend is all the resumes that we receive will be put in a binder for you so you can see them all. Nothing is going to be held back from you. You're going to be able to see all of them. In the past there was a binder kept on the third floor, so any one of you could check it out and take a look and sort of make notes and and decide which candidates do you really want to see . And then in closed session, you can discuss the top candidates and decide who you want to interview after you've put it into a long list. Then we would have panel interviews and that's with you, and that's a panels of your choosing. And it can be up to three different panels and those who can be community members, business leaders, any sort of nonprofit groups that you think would be vital to have in a in a. In a screening sort of process to really about the candidates. And so after that, the list gets smaller and you guys make your decision in closed session and hammered out. That's basically what members were. Do you have comments you'd like to share at this point? Well. What was that? What was the process you're looking for in terms of actually. We're just looking for input or feedback. If you'd like to discuss it today and give me some feedback today, that would be great. Normally I'd be Paul and he'd be talking to him, but I'm here now and you're welcome to talk to me about it. So I'm happy to start. Sure. I'm I appreciate that all the applications will be collected so that we can all review them and give feedback and then discuss it and decide who we're going to interview as a support that process. Personally, I will be looking forward to hopefully receiving some applications from current employees and Allen meetings. Thank you. Adama? Yes, Vice Mayor. I at the risk of. Well, I'll say this anyway. Is is Mr. Chmura going to be back? Does he have a second? Because if the situation goes longer than he anticipates, does he have someone who. If he's planning on coming back, he's going to be back in the Bay Area tonight, actually, today or tomorrow. He needed to be with family today. Thank you. Thank you for. Making sure that we have. Yes. Yes. No, he he he will be back tomorrow. And he he tried to call me a couple of times today, and I told him he needed, you know, just be with your family right now. Thank you. But he will be back tomorrow. In other comments, remember. Oh. I have to go that way. I won't cut you off. Oh, no, it was. It was a. It was on the consent calendar. I didn't have an opportunity to speak and the discussion was closed really fast. So. Thank you for. Thank you for. Thank you. So thank you for stepping in for Mr. Kummer. I appreciate that. I like the idea of the town hall meeting where we, the public, can have some input. I also like the process that we we did the last time we recruited where we had various panels and then we had a panel that the council was able to appoint, you know, one or two community members to that panel. So we had a wide range and, you know, and a diverse. Group of community members that can evaluate. And I think they all came up to a unanimous decision. So hopefully we'll have the same thing. I like the idea of having individual meetings with the council members so we can share some of our thoughts on where we want to move forward with the city. You know, I'm pretty open. I think I said this before, you know, whether we're you know, whether we get, you know, somebody that's experienced or whether we get somebody that's, you know, hungry and new, whether we get someone that's, you know, ready to take the next step. That may not be a city manager right now. So, you know, I hope that we do have a wide range of of applicants and experience. This is an exciting time for our city. So, you know, we're growing and, you know, we have a lot of opportunities and there are a lot of people out there that are, you know, ready to take that next step. So I would encourage them, you know, us to try to recruit them. You know, I'd like to see us, you know, if I had a preference. There's somebody that has knowledge and experience in the Bay Area. It doesn't have to be in Alameda, but at least the Bay Area as opposed to Southern California. But, you know, if there's a star down there that that's ready and that that understands our culture and, you know, understands our region, then that would be helpful as well. That's kind of all I really had add to add at this time. Mm hmm. And I apologize if earlier you didn't feel. Like it passed unanimously. So it's for everyone. Member Congress we'll try to make it up to you. The. I think that. Thank you very much. And I'm excited to get started with this process. One of the things that I've thought of and I'll refine my thoughts more before I meet with Mr. Chmura, but I'm looking for a city manager who can work with the Council of strong individuals, strong personalities, strong opinions. And I think that this is perhaps the most important decision this council will make, because we are at the brink of doing a lot of exciting things in Alameda, and we need someone who can run this city well now with an eye to the future. And and it's also important to me to have someone who will work equally with all members of the city council. And the while, I am certainly supportive of having various panels have an opportunity to meet and interview. The ultimate decision, I feel, has to rest with the city council because the city manager is one of our our direct reports. And I think that's a a responsibility that we don't see to others. So anyway, that's I think that's. A good start for the evening. And I do appreciate the vice mayor raising the question of Mr. Cameras. Eventual or coming up soon availability because I think we also made clear in the selection process that it was him not his partner, that we wanted for Alameda search member Daisuke. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I think I'm just going to say some thoughts in how you, you know, put that paper. I'll leave that to you. But there are several. I think everybody every council member in every city says that their city is unique and clearly every city is unique. But, you know, I think most of us share the same types of cost centers when it on the budget side. Most of us share, you know, the same thoughts on staffing ratios, etc.. But there are uniqueness to Alameda that I think many places can't point to. And I think it has to be part of the decision making process. For example, not the organizational structure with regard to Alameda Point, as well as the fact of Alameda Point as a large brownfield redevelopment area. That's a uniqueness that many cities don't have overall, not just the construction entitlement related issues, but also, you know, that the way in which that connects with federal laws, etc., and state laws. And another uniqueness is, is the city of Alameda is electric utility AMP. Many cities don't have their own electric utility. The what I'm getting at, though, is what I want to hear is how city managers or or assistant city managers are dealt with similar. For example, while many cities don't have a standalone utility company. Many cities might have their own wastewater or water treatment, whatever, as a standalone enterprise fund generate. So so same of this same type of issues of ratepayer issues of of of assets, stranded assets. The same type of questions arise in those scenarios that would also apply to experience with with electric company. So, so what I'm getting at is even though not every candidate is dealt with, might have dealt with base closure, look for kind of proxies that come close to it. So a proxy the base closure might be. You know, a large infill brownfield redevelopment project, a multi-year project. So so look and again that back to the the Enterprise Fund of of of amp look for you know what what kind of proxies my might shed some light in terms of someone's experience in handling that managing that. So I think that's the thing that that crosses my mind. So even though people might not have managed or been a part of the governing board of Electric Company. You know, figure out ways to the I we as a council and a community can kind of pass out where there might be some crossover relevant crossover experience. Thank you. Any other comments? So I appreciate staff attaching all these copies to what other cities have done and as well as Alameda. And so I'm expecting that we will be given a draft and all of us will be able to give feedback and and that of this team or of Avery will somehow be coordinating with all of us for feedback. And if you look at the one from Alameda, of course, it's stated at this point, but a lot of it is still very valid and done nicely, I think. Thank you for sharing it. Right. And I would like to roll ahead with the SurveyMonkey survey, and we can do that and then right away. So if that's good with you, I'm going to had an exciting. Moment with that. Any concerns you see with the question? So if you can come up with. Oh, no, you were given. The fact that were talking about those. Yes. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Yes. I mean. Yes. As written, I'm sorry about that. Scientific, but it's not that scientific. It's not that scientific. But makes it unpredictable to add comments. Yes. So yes, which is fine is electronic. We can disseminate it into the community, can be aware that we will be using an electronic survey member Ashcraft. And what's the timeframe for when our one on one interviews with Mr. Cameron will. In the very near future because we want to move this along so we will probably contact you next week. Okay. Thank you. Before July. Yes, thank you. All right. Any other comments on that item? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. City Manager Communications. You're up. All right. You're a nun, madam. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Or communications? Not agenda. Thank you, counselor. Referrals? None. Wonderful council communications. At this point, council members can address on any matter, not on the agenda. And Brody. Thank you, madam. I have two quick ones. This morning I attended the Alameda County Waste Management Authority meeting of the Programs and Administration Committee. And I guess I would say nothing of note that impacts alameda was discussed and last Friday I had the honor to attend the Boys and Girls Club annual meeting and recognize Linda Callaway.","Recommendation to Provide Input to Avery & Associates on the Qualifications of a City Manager, the Recruitment Brochure and the Selection Process.  (Human Resources 2510)","Here is a concise summary capturing the main points from the presentation:

The presentation was given by Stephanie Geller, the Administrative Services Director, in place of Paul Comer who had a family emergency. The key objectives were:

1. To discuss the recruitment process and timeline for hiring a new City Manager.
2. To gather input from the City Council on desired attributes and priorities for the next City Manager.

The proposed initiatives and process include:

- Developing a marketing brochure highlighting operational, financial and strategic priorities based on Council input
- Holding a town hall meeting and public survey to get community feedback 
- Reviewing all applicant resumes and creating a long list for Council
- Using panel interviews with Council, community members and others to vet candidates
- Council making the final hire decision in closed session

Key points of reasoning and context:

- Alameda is a unique city with aspects like Alameda Point redevelopment and its own electric utility (AMP) that require City Manager experience/proxies in managing similar complex situations
- Council wants broad candidate pool including internal staff, diversity of backgrounds and experience levels
- Important to find a City Manager who can work well with the current Council's strong opinions while staying neutral  
- Ultimate hire is a critical decision as Alameda is poised for major changes and initiatives
- Council will be heavily involved, with Mr. Comer meeting members individually before drafting brochure

Thank you, officers. Okay. And this is city attorneys. Yes. Good evening, Mayor and Council. I'm going to do a very fast staff report at this hour. We appreciate. That. This ordinance proposed in front of you tonight seeks to clarify housing laws for the city of Alameda. There has been there are a lot of federal and state laws that apply here, and there are also a lot of civil laws that may apply here. But this law attempts to put city of Alameda housing laws in clear terms. It essentially creates three components, and much of that is not subject to serious debate with respect to whether or not it has applicability in in a rental community. The first of the first of which is disruption of housing services. There is substantial civil law out there and also state and federal law that requires non disruption of housing services, such as disconnection of utilities or lockouts unless it's authorized by a court of law. This ordinance here makes that explicit in the city of Alameda with respect to tenant harassment. This law spells out certain behaviors that are clearly outside the pail and make them prohibited. The third component with augments state and federal laws with respect to discrimination. It specifically indicates that whether it's disability, age, housing status and perhaps most importantly, source of income, these categories cannot be bases of discrimination in the city of Alameda. I want to point out that source of income is the one area where probably the most substantive change is being proposed tonight. That particular change, its source of income protect this source of income protection will protect, for example, persons receiving subsidies such as Section eight. That protection does not currently exist in any other source of law. And so the Council will be making a significant substantive change here. And there has been two cases litigated, at least in the state of California, one by the city and county of San Francisco, one by the city of Santa monica. In both cases, California courts have affirmed local jurisdictions right to prohibit this type of discrimination and the ordinances before the Council for your consideration. I'm happy to take your questions. Any questions of staff? Councilmember Desai So. Currently isn't it correct to say that when a landlord accepts a Section eight tenant that they are also entering into a contract with the housing authority that, among other things, stipulates that the landlord is going to provide a unit that's going to meet certain standards established by HUD and managed or monitored by the local housing authority. Yes. Yeah. So so here's the question then. So that the changes that were contemplating then. Are we not then saying that? That landlords have to accept Section eight. I mean, because if they have to accept Section eight and it's no longer a voluntary thing. Then aren't we saying that landlords have to adopt or accept the the standards that are stipulated in HUD? Not necessarily Councilmember de Song. What landlords have to do is to essentially not discriminate on the basis of source of income. So, for example, a landlord could say, I want a tenant with a particular credit score or I want a tenant with a particular income to debt ratio, or I want a tenant with a particular background, for example. No, no unlawful detainers. All of these are legitimate bases. What a landlord could not do under this ordinance to say to say, my rent is $2,000 a month. I will take 2000 from any other source. But I if the two part of that 2000 comes from federal government subsidies, that's no good to me. That is the one behavior that this this particular source of income discrimination prohibition will seek to stop. Mm hmm. But couldn't. A tenant. Advocate, legal advocate. Take up a case of a Section eight household who thought that she or he was discriminated against because they were Section eight, even if there was no language that says, you know. You will not discriminate against Section eight. It's just the point at which the prospective tenant had indicated that her or his source of income was Section eight. And so by not. Getting the unit could detect. Could that then set up a situation where that tenant was saying, well, I'm going to make a discrimination case? It is hypothetically possible, though, under existing law, for example, let's say it's a male tenant and the landlord sees the male tenant and then chooses to rent to a female tenant under existing law. This tenant could choose to sue for gender discrimination, even though the landlord may have chosen the female tenant because she's got a much better credit score. So it is hypothetically possible, though, it would fall into the same paradigm that is today with respect to other categories of discrimination. Any other clarifying questions? Okay, let's go to public speakers. Okay. Alan T Cherry Johansen, Madeline Howard and Laura. Regina. Eleanor Schweizer. I'm actually going to talk really fast because I have several really questions. So my reading of the court cases regarding Section eight in terms of discrimination is that you are indeed required to enter into the agreement. You have to sign it. And according to the legislation analysis for the Section eight, the LED the bill that's going through the Senate and may have been defeated. They also said, yes, you will have to sign the agreement. You can't say I would accept the money, but I must sign the agreement. So probably want to double check that the burden of proof for a landlord who is abused by a tenant is a much higher bar because that involves termination of tenancy and that involves the whole unlawful detainer. So both parties should be really held to the same civilized behavior without having to resort to threatening to terminate tenancy and going through all of that. So every place in this where it talks about the landlord as the offending party really should be either person. Everybody should be civilized. I asked the question I did not get an answer in regards to if a landlord or some other authorized person while lawfully entering a rental unit sees damage in the area that they're in. They see the door has a giant hole punched in it. They see the toilet cracked. Can they document that? Can they act on that knowledge because it says harassment, says you cannot collect evidence and I just need clarification that that is indeed. Yes, you can document it and it's totally a cool. That would be great. So otherwise everything else in this. Totally support. Thank you. Speaker Sherry to him. Of. Good evening, everybody awake? I am speaking right now as Sherry Johansen for Alameda. Progressives and the Alimony Progressives have worked with our allies and this council to extend renter protection to most of the residents of Alameda, including tonight's ordinances. We agree with with Councilman Odie that housing is a human right. We would like to keep our neighbors and our friends and our families, our children in Alameda and help prevent this epidemic of homelessness that we have in the Bay Area. I am hoping that this ordinance and I'm not a lawyer and neither is anybody on the Alameda Progressives Board will extend the protections that we have fought so hard for to as an umbrella for residents who do not have the income, who are disabled, who may be in Section eight or may be covered under the housing authority , because these evictions and harassment we had harassment of for 70. So I'm glad that that's taken care of as extended to to the entire rental community in Alameda. So we are in favor of this ordinance. Thank you. And Madeline Howard, then Lorna. Hello again. I'm Madeline Howard with Western Center on Law and Poverty. I also live in Alameda. Thank you to the city attorney and to the council for this ordinance. I strongly support it. This is incredibly important for to protect our most vulnerable residents. And I also wanted to point out that as I'm sure the city attorney is aware, there are increased obligations under a new state law that we sponsored AB 686 that requires the city to take affirmative steps to end segregation and to promote integration. And this ordinance would be an important step towards that goal because people with housing choice vouchers are disproportionately people within protected classes, people of color, people with disabilities, as you've already heard. So allowing these members of the community to have increased protections would be an important step towards that goal. Thank you. Mr. Sheen. Good evening again and thank you very much to the mayor and the city council for voting today on an emergency ordinance. And my father and I are very grateful, as well as many people in Alameda who rely on Section eight. I'm sure they do appreciate it as well. Thank you for closing the loophole and doing the right thing. And a second, thank you to the city council for this ordinance. You did a tremendous work here, and it's very important that this ordinance is enacted, because today I think that the Alameda Housing Authority addressed that issue, that people in Section eight might be discriminated against. Well, the way to close this and to, um, to protect them from discrimination would be to enact this very ordinance. And I can tell you that during the last two years ordeal, I scoured the Craigslist numerous times. And what I find deeply offensive is when I look at it and it says, no dogs, no Section eight. Full stop. This should not be allowed. And I think this is very well the ordinance is very well worded. I think it will allow protection to the most vulnerable people and I encourage the city to vote for it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Uh, is there a speaker? Correct. Okay. Um, council. Council member. Only did I see your handout. Sure. I'll go first. Um, as a result, we did include immigration status in here. We believe that's fully protected because. It has a David choose. Okay. Also is thank you for bringing this forward. I mean, I trust our city attorney a judgment over anyone else's in this matter given, you know, he's litigated in this matter and worked in a city that has sworn to protect tenants. And you probably even may have worked on that case. I don't know. So I'm fully prepared to support this. And it's about time. Set in motion. Well. Sure. Second. Is there any further discussion? Can I just ask a quick question? There was a the speaker asked a question. You were nodding your head, but he wasn't looking at you. He was looking at us. Can you just answer that? Yes. With respect. Yes. With respect to the question of whether a landlord could legitimately go into a unit to document actual legitimate damage, the answer is yes. Thank you. All right. So we've had a motion. Did we have a second wave of discussion? And Councilmember. So just some quick points. I believe the city of San Jose had passed a similar ordinance last month and I think there are certain provisions in it where. A certain there is language about a fix up period. So if someone found a Section eight landlord to be not compliant with whatever. Rather than go immediately to litigation or encourage that that that some kind of fix it period was adopted. The other thing, too, was that there was a delay in implementation for 60 days. So that so that the so that stakeholders, both sides, all sides could understand what was the ramification, clear ramifications of this. So I'm wondering if that was something that anyone would be interested in. I will just. Say that? Well, first of all, this would need a second reading, correct? Yes. So it does. There's 30 days and it comes back and there's certainly time for some landlord education. I would hope that the prohibitions in this ordinance are the sort of thing that a landlord wouldn't need to be told are wrong. I do know what Miss Ritchie was referring to about Craigslist ads, but that's one of the places where we're doing enforcement. We might you know, we might look. But I would think that the the time it takes to enact the ordinance for it to go into effect would would address the need for landlords to be educated. My thought. Okay. Any further discussion? Well, I'm just going to assume if we approve it tonight, there's 60 days before it goes into effect. So it does. Right. All right. Any any action we have has that. 30 days before the second reading and then 30 days before it goes into. Effect. From my position. That. It's 45 days. So the second reading will be two weeks from now and then it'll be another 30. Days before that. Okay. I'm not inclined to add another 15 to that. I was just going to say I am a big fan of conversation and education, but I think where we're actually trying to stop discrimination, the idea of holding off and stopping discrimination for a few more days so that we can help people understand that they shouldn't discriminate. If that's if that's really needed, then we should figure out how to get this happening. So. So you agree with me? Okay. My my concern isn't only that this is a discussion about discrimination, but this is also a discussion about HUD standards that some smaller mom and pop landlords might feel that they have to they might not be inclined to get in volved in the program because for whatever reason, they might feel that previously they might have felt that it was bureaucratic. But by virtue of adopting this now, they might feel like they have to, but not quite recognizing that if they adopt this program, then they're not only that, one of the implications of that is also having to then adopt. Certain standards that we might have that that HUD or the local housing authority might have. For example, I think one of the standards that our housing authority has is that, you know, as part of Section eight, you know, every unit has to have a 60 B 65 degrees between the month of October and May. Not only does every unit have to be at a minimum, 65 degrees between October and May, that. If if the heating unit or air conditioning unit breaks down. A temporary replacement. One of those things that you bring in is not allowed. So it's these kinds of details that I think people need to be aware of when they're entering into the Section eight. And I think it takes time for people to understand that. But I don't know. I mean, I. So I, I'm I think you raise good points. I also am, as was noted earlier in the previous housing item, there will be workshops in September and October and we can certainly ask staff now that we know. And Mr. Katz from the Housing Authority is nodding in agreement in the audience now, and the workshops really are excellent and informative, and they also videotape the one at the library. So even if you can't be there in person. But I think those are valid concerns to raise. But I think there are ways that that can be addressed in educational forums. So I know Mr. Odie and Councilmember Odie made a motion to approve this. Did I have a second? I do. Okay. Councilmember Vela seconds. So all in favor of this ordinance amending the municipal code i. I opposed. Abstain. Okay. So that motion passes for in favor of one abstention. Okay. We got to move along, people, because we're only going till midnight. So we've got one more regular calendar item, which is six F and that's also your. Is also me. All right. This to make this one fast as well mayor and council the proposal in front of you tonight requests that the city attorney's office is staffed with a prosecution unit consisting of one city prosecutor slash attorney and one paralegal investigator. The proposal will allow this unit to work with the district attorney's office, our partners at the police department, fire department, code enforcement, in order to enforce the various laws that this council has adopted, and as well as having the opportunity to enforce state laws. And one of the most important things I want to point out and maybe a few important things that one in in order for us to do prosecution, we do it in the name of justice. So there is not a particular group or a particular agenda that this group will be undertaking.","Introduction of Ordinance Amending the Alameda Municipal Code by Adding Article XVIII to Chapter VI Concerning Fair Housing and Tenant Protections by Prohibiting Unlawful Tenant Harassment, Disruption of Housing Services and Housing Discrimination including Source of Income. (City Attorney 2310)","Here is a concise summary capturing the key points from the presentation:

The presentation covered a proposed ordinance to amend the Alameda Municipal Code by adding fair housing and tenant protection provisions. The key components are:

1. Prohibiting disruption of housing services like utility disconnection or lockouts without court order. This codifies existing civil laws.

2. Prohibiting specific acts of tenant harassment. 

3. Prohibiting housing discrimination based on protected classes like disability, age, housing status, and notably source of income - a new substantive change to protect Section 8 recipients. Courts have affirmed cities' right to prohibit this discrimination.

There were questions around implications for landlords accepting Section 8, such as having to meet HUD housing standards monitored by the housing authority. But the ordinance simply prohibits discriminating against applicants due to their source of income being a housing subsidy.

The ordinance aims to protect vulnerable residents and promote integration as required by a new state law. There were concerns about providing an education/grace period for landlords, but the staged approval process allows time for that before implementation.

Ultimately, the council voted 4-1 to approve the fair housing ordinance, taking an important step to prohibit housing discrimination based on source of income in Alameda.

The presentation also briefly covered staffing a city prosecution unit to enforce adopted laws without targeting any particular group, working in partnership with other agencies.",0.8550000000000002,"Approach each presentation by thoroughly reasoning about the core ideas, logical flow, and contextual factors first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

I am not reading that one. Councilman Lopez, will you please read proclamation 158? Thank you, Mr. President. Will do proclamation number 158 series of 2016 in support of National Native HIV AIDS Awareness Day and National Women and Girls HIV AIDS Awareness Day. Excuse me. WHEREAS, approximately 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV and more than 50,000 become infected with HIV every year. 26% are between the ages of 13 and 24. Female youth accounted for nearly 2000 of all youth living with HIV. And. Whereas, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment at the end of 2014, more than 12,900 people were reported to be living with HIV in the state of Colorado. And. Whereas, HIV and AIDS has affected the city and county of Denver more than any other area in the state of Colorado reporting the most persons living with the disease, most HIV or AIDS related deaths, and 40% of new HIV infections in 2014. And. WHEREAS, the continued spread of HIV in the American Indian and Alaska Native communities poses a significant risk to the public health and well-being of these communities. They are the third highest rate of new HIV infections in 2014. Whereas when compared to other ethnic groups, American Indians and Alaska Natives are ranked fifth in estimated rates of HIV diagnosis and have poor survival rates after HIV diagnosis. HIV infection was the ninth leading cause of death among American Indian and Alaska Native youth, aged 25 to 34 in 2010. And. WHEREAS, approximately one in four people living with HIV in the U.S. are women, cases disproportionately affect African-American and Latino women, who represent 28% of all women in the U.S., but account for 80% of HIV cases among women. And. Whereas, the city and county of Denver recognizes to continue to work to bring HIV and AIDS awareness by groups such as to Cultura. Children's Hospital Immunodeficiency Program. Sisters of Color United for Education. Colorado Organization for Latino Opportunity and Reproductive Rights. Denver Indian Center. Denver. Indian and Family. Denver. Indian Health and Family Services. Lakota Way. Healing Center. Sister Nations. Color Guard. Branching Seeds of Resistance. University of Denver. Graduate School of Social Work and Servicios de la Raza. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one, that the Denver City Council proclaims March 10th, 2016, to be known as National Women's, National Women and Girls HIV AIDS Awareness Day. And March 20th. 2016 as National Native HIV AIDS Awareness Day. Section two that the clerk of the city and county of Denver shall attest and affixed the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that copies be transmitted to Café Cultura and Servicios de la Raza. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Your motion to adopt. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council proclamation 158 series of 2016 be adopted. It has been moved and seconded. Comments. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. It's been a an honor and a tradition to bring this proclamation to the council chambers, because this issue in this proclamation represents an issue that affects every single human being, every single country in this world. But especially in this country. Latinos, African-Americans and and Native women. You know, I think we've made a lot of progress. In terms of what we can do to build awareness. To have access to education. To proper health care. Access to reproductive health. But also. I think it's. Access to areas where we are definitely underserved. And we definitely have challenges. You know, I. I know we made a lot of progress. But we have a lot of work to do. These are mothers. These are sisters and daughters. And these are. Folks who need our help. And we have. And I believe I. Without getting in too much of the politics and the nitty gritty. I think we have the resources and access and power in this lifetime to bring this disease to a to an end. We absolutely do. And we put the kind of resources we put into national security. And called this a national security risk. This would be cure. We shouldn't have to have bake sales or small fundraisers for an epidemic like this. And it's these kinds of proclamations and these kinds of efforts that help remind that to folks who are blessed to have access to health care and education and reproductive services. It's a blessing, but there's a lot of folks that don't. And so this proclamation is dedicated to those efforts. It recognizes and honors those efforts. And I just have to say thank you to all you todos. Thank you to all you caseworkers. Thank you to all you folks that are inside the households of our neighborhoods, making sure people understand this issue and how to prevent it. It's absolutely preventable. So without further ado, Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support this proclamation in the spirit of this proclamation, asking my colleagues to do the same. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I just it's hard to repeat all of what Councilman Lopez has said, because he pretty much took, you know, the words that I would want to share. I think the most important thing is the work is not done yet. There's still a lot more to do in this arena. And I am grateful for all the service providers we have in the Denver community that work with people in Denver who are dealing with this situation. I serve on the board of a nonprofit that provides housing for people with AIDS. And, you know, HUD got to a point where they created a separate designation for funding called funding because the need was so great. But I look forward to a day when we don't have to have this proclamation and we have found a cure and we don't have to have people dealing with this disease. So thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega and Councilman Lopez. Rebecca. I keep forgetting main points. You know, in recognizing that it affects that this is disproportionately affecting women and the fact that we need to have to increase access and education. Let me make sure that the word is out there and it gets out that you men have to also take responsibility as well, too. You young boys got to protect yourself as well, to his credit. You contract it, you spread it. This isn't this. This disease does not discriminate. It doesn't discriminate based on sexuality, gender, race, anything. And the young men and men also we also have this responsibility as well to it's on our shoulders. And I wanted to make that point as well, too. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Any other comments? One, five, eight. Scene nine. Madam Secretary. Rocko Lopez. I am new Ortega Sussman Black. Hi, Clark. Hi, Espinosa. I. Flynn. I. Gilmore. I can eat. Mr. President, I. Councilman Espinosa. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you. Madam Secretary. Please close the voting now. The results. 1212 eyes one five has been adopted. Councilman Lopez, there's someone you like to invite to the podium. Yeah, there is a there's a couple of people. One of them, Jaylene Salazar, who is with service services, La Raza and anybody else who if I didn't realize I supposed to call it, make sure they come up. And. Ah, yeah, that's right. I was going to call on him. I was going to pick on him. Ira Cruz, who is with Garfinkle Dura, who is a constituent of mine and also a. College colleague of mine to. And Gillian, you're a college colleague of mine. That's right. A colleague of mine to. Awesome. Cool. So first of all, thank you to city council and especially to Councilmember Lopez for continuing to support this this effort. Right. I think it's been three years. Four years. We've done a proclamation for four years. Yeah. And I wanted to recognize some other organizations who are who are here as well. We have a Lakota Way Healing Center as well. Representative, somebody from from that organization would like to to come up and join us. We appreciate that. And there are so many other organizations that were involved in putting this proclamation together, as well as just to organize the Rise Up event. It's our seventh annual Rise Up event that we've organized for the last four years. We've been at the Denver Indian Center, and it's definitely been a great opportunity for people, the community, to come together and learn about how to protect themselves, how to how to be able to kind of look at it holistically as well and be able to support one another in our efforts. And with with the rise up event, we've hosted free HIV testing provided usually by Servicios BI Sisters of Color, United for Education, as well as the Children's Hospital Immunization Immunodeficiency Program, Chip. And, and luckily we have haven't had very many positive tests come back. I remember a couple of years ago we had a young man from Longmont, 18 years old, who found out he was positive and wouldn't have otherwise known if he hadn't come to the event. And so I would echo the sentiments of Congress, Councilwoman Ortega not having to have these kind of proclamations and events. But in the meantime, we continuously have to do that. So with that, I'll go ahead and hand it over to Jaylene and Cindy if they would like to offer some comments. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Angelina Salazar and I work with services at La Raza, our HIV program, where we day on a daily basis work with men, women and youth who are living with HIV. So I wanted to thank, on behalf of our positive community in Denver, thank each and every one of you for recognizing the importance of this issue. As you both have said, you know, we've come a long way. We have a long way to go. It starts with you all as our leaders. It starts with you all as our community. And so we're in this fight together because it is the future of our generations. It's pretty alarming to see the rates of which youth 13 to 25 are being diagnosed with HIV. Women, youth, people of color. I mean, it's it's scary. And so we need to take our own efforts in really protecting ourselves and others, as well as doing our best to educate our community to minimize the stigma of HIV. That's a huge piece. I think if we were to do that, we'd be able to understand one another, be a little bit more compassionate, and really be able to to minimize the risk and incidence of HIV across all of our communities and across the globe. So I thank each and every one of you. We'd love to invite you on this Friday to come to our Rise Up event at the Denver Indian Center. 6 p.m. There's free food again, free testing. We'll be doing free HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea testing as well. We want to keep our community safe. Please. So come and join us now to share some spoken word with you. Even educate each and every one of you. Teach you something about HIV that maybe you didn't know before and can spread the message on to a niece, nephew, child, even your own parents. So we're not too young. We're not too old to learn about this epidemic. And let's make a change for the better together. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening. My name's Cindy Rice. I represent the Lakota Way Healing Center. We are located out of a church, the Four Winds. Church on Fifth and Bannock. My voice kind of sounds a little harsh. Approximately. There are over 506 federally recognized tribes. And of those. Tribes, a lot of the Native Americans. Come from the reservation and they, they migrate here. Um, we come from the social, economic standpoint because we deal with people that are drug addicted, whether that's intravenous drugs or they suffer from alcoholism, homelessness, the whole factors that perpetuate this problem. And from our standpoint, we recognize that on the reservations prior to them coming here, the reservations are so distant from the cities or health care in general. Some of the youth and some of the people affected with HIV and AIDS, they don't they don't get the help that they need. Sometimes the nearest health facility is over an hour away on the remote areas of the reservation. So yeah, education. Is part of it, but part of it. Is access to the facilities. Again, we get some of these people here from the reservations and when they come here, their problem is adjusting to a city environment. And so. With that. Statue, statistically 1.7. A million Native Americans nationwide are infected with HIV and AIDS. And so we do what we can to promote it like our I had said earlier on a holistic standpoint. So we support HIV and AIDS National Recognition Day. And we thank all of you, chairwoman and chairman, for recognizing this proclamation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Councilman Lopez, for always bringing this forward. We are moving on to the resolutions. Madam Secretary, will you please read the resolutions.",A proclamation in support of National Native HIV/AIDS Awareness Day and National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.,"Here is a concise summary capturing the main points from the presentation:

The presentation focuses on proclamations issued by the Denver City Council recognizing National Native HIV/AIDS Awareness Day on March 20th and National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day on March 10th. The proclamations aim to raise awareness about the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on certain communities, especially Native Americans, women, Latinos, and African Americans. 

Key points:

- Over 1.1 million Americans are living with HIV, with over 50,000 new infections annually, many among youth.

- In Colorado, over 12,900 people were living with HIV at the end of 2014, with Denver seeing the highest rates statewide.

- Native American and Alaska Native communities face high rates of new HIV infections and poor survival rates after diagnosis.

- Women, particularly African American and Latina women, are disproportionately affected, accounting for 80% of cases among women despite making up only 28% of the U.S. female population.

- The proclamations recognize local organizations working on HIV/AIDS awareness, testing, and support services.

- Speakers emphasized the need for continued awareness efforts, education, access to healthcare/reproductive services, and reducing stigma, despite progress made. 

- They expressed hope that dedicating more resources could help end the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which impacts all communities regardless of gender, sexuality or race.

- Local organizations provided testing at an annual ""Rise Up"" event and shared perspectives on challenges faced, especially by Native American communities lacking nearby healthcare access.",0.0,"Approach each presentation by thoroughly reasoning about the core ideas, logical flow, and contextual factors first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Questions or comments by members of Council. Council Member Sandbach. Did you put on 386? Correct. This is 279. Okay. So this one is an issue. Thank you, Mr. President. This one is an issue for me. I'd like to call the vote on this because a National Western Authority is something that I had been involved in way before even getting elected. And there was a huge fight from community to have representation, voting representation on the National Western Authority. In the last few months, we've lost our voting member who is a resident of the neighborhood, and we sent multiple applicants to boards and commissions to fill that seat. While I don't have any objection to the individual who was appointed the voting member as a person. I think that we missed the intent of that seat to have resident representation because the individual does not live in our neighborhood. The other person being appointed is a non-voting member of our neighborhood, and I think that's incredibly problematic and not true to the intent of this seat. So I will be a no on this, and I encourage my colleagues to honor the neighborhood and the intent of this position as the only neighborhood or only resident representation on this board and vote no on this as well, and send boards and commissions back to the drawing board to ensure that we have resident representation as a voting member on this board. Thank you, Councilmember. Next up, councilmember talks. Just a question. I don't see groping in the room. I don't know if you. Have any information. About this particular bill. And if you could go over to the iPad is the presentation. Oh, sure. Skye Stewart from the mayor's office. I have not been totally involved in this, but are happy to try and answer questions for you. Here is the. It looks like the. Residence that was in terms of women concerned about providing them as well to keeping her place for them. As well. As the resident board. Member. I believe that is correct, yes. So we're looking at every almost scenario as a community member, board. Member, but the non-voting one in. So I'm talking off the top of my head here, so I probably will need to get you a more complete answer. But the way the framework agreement set up this or before that, there is a nonresident voting member and then a community member that does not necessarily have to be from the neighborhood but should represent a certain perspective and not just the seat that Curtis house is filling. And then the neighborhood seat is a non-voting seat. So there would be no voting member who a resident of the. Parliament for the various functions. I believe that is correct. But I would really have to check back with our remaining moments in a long time, because I look at that framework agreement. And. I think concerned about that too. I have no objection to this House actually, which. Is a phenomenal individual and a. Great board member. But I do concerned that it could getting compared to a. Community block. When there's no other. Residents from the neighborhood also on the board. So I'll be in the room as well. All right. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Hines. Thank you, Mr. President. And Mr. Reid, thank you for your. Willingness to field these questions, even though. This isn't totally your wheelhouse to see. You know it is. Is this the board or a third of the board members are District ten residents. I do not know the answer to that off the top of my head. So I am excited. I guess I believe that that's the case. So I'm excited that a district that has an outsized sense of representation for the board and I would share some concerns as well that someone from the neighborhood is it that this opportunity has become part of the has been saying nothing about us without us? And I would like to see that at least one member of District five of that specific community is is represented. So thank you, Mr. District Councilmember. Councilmember CdeBaca. Thank you. Mr. President, I have a proposal. If Sky is able to make the has the authority to accept it. Is it possible to flip these two appointees? Because one is the voting, one is the non-voting, one is a resident, one is a nonresident. Is it possible to appoint Mr. House as the non-voting member and the other person as the voting member? So again, the roller coaster ride of memory on the framework agreement, I believe. Well, so let me start first by saying that we would have to take that through a process that needs to happen for more efficient appointments. Romanian media involved. And we would need to talk with the mayor. But I believe the answer to that is no, because the non-voting member serves specifically has to be a neighborhood resident. I would again have to go back to the framework agreement and check that. But if I remember correctly, that is the case that there has to be a member of that neighborhood in that seat as a non-voting member or in this House would not be able to be put into that seat. Anything else? Is it possible for you to verify who is being replaced? Because although Jonathan Zobayan is on the board, he is not a resident of the neighborhood. He's a property owner in the neighborhood, but not a resident. And and I would be curious to know if he's cycling off or who is cycling off, because there are three other people that we know of who are cycling off. So I don't have that information in front of me. If you want to hold on voting on this one, I can see what I can do to get that if you want to come back to it. But I don't have it in front of me right this minute. Thank you. All right. Council member, can you. There are few more people in the queue sky. And my intelligence. Firm. Yes, go ahead, counselor. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate some of the questions being raised. I actually have a question about the third appointee. And this happens to have a success. I can't remember if I voted against this Pakistani person, but I know history concerns about the individual who informally got to the staff position immediately when they left. The employment being put on the board did not feel appropriate to me at that time having that continue. So it seems to me like it might be. This is a great example. We've made it a long time without committee, but I think we should send this committee for some discussion. I mean, it just seems like we can get more information on the current membership as a whole. It's very difficult always talking about an appointment without understanding the other members of the entire board. That's the practice that we now speaking on. When we're making council appointments, we never leave them in a vacuum. We uniformly serve. And so I think it's not about the individuals per se, but it is about what's the overall balance of representation, of importance of this body in particular. I'm afraid of the fact that given some of the economic impacts that are happening, you know, understanding how this may affect the national progress in terms of larger staff, it just seems like these are pretty important appointments at this moment. So I would make the motion to send this back to committee. And in generally speaking, I don't think we have to have a date associated with that because I don't know how that's going to be done this year. But if I can have a second, I will make that most of the sentence. That's all right. Madam Secretary, do you need anything else for that motion to be referred to through? And I'm seeing Councilmember Ortega as seconded. That you're a voice that Councilmember Ortega so that we have you on record on voiced you. So yes, I would like to second that. I think it's important for us to have complete information. And I've texted a couple of people just trying to clarify whether or not Mr. Zuckerman has left. And so I think it's important for us to have complete information on where we are with all those positions. Okay. And Councilmember Torres, I still have you in the queue. Are you okay with the referral to committee or if you want to jump in as well? Okay, then let me go over to you. Go ahead. Thank you. I am fully supportive of the Reform Committee. What I am remembering was I actually made the request. Of. The National Center to see. Someone from. The native community. And so I appreciate that this house was put forward. What I see as community representation. So I think there could be greater accommodation. For community representation and. Right. Councilmember, can each and every forward vote when you were. Like three or four. Yes. A specific request which is that if we can have this information provided by running for office and the information circulated well before committee, I think it's time to have a challenge getting responses from the information office. And I think it's really critical that we not wait until the committee date to begin answering some of the questions . And so we request that that information begin getting gathered in there, because it's possible that there could be some discussion and perhaps even, you know, the administration may decide to withdraw its proposal. So I don't think that our work needs to begin in subcommittee, but with that. Thank you, Councilmember. All right. Secretary, let's vote on the motion on the floor to refer. To the committee. Who am I. With? Hi. You're fine. I can eat. So I thought I said about coffee. I. Cashman. Councilmember Cashman We couldn't be more different. Ortega I know. I. Council President. Of Surgery Christos Boateng, announced results. 1339. Council Resolution 279 will be referred back to committee. All right, Madam Secretary, if you please, for the next item on our screen, it is called out by two different members. This is 386. So, Councilor Canete, you ought to go ahead with your comments.","A resolution approving the Mayor’s reappointment and appointments to the National Western Center Authority Board. Approves the Mayoral reappointment of Kelly Leid and Mayoral appointments of Ernest House, Jr. and Gabriela Acevedo (as a non-voting neighborhood resident) to the National Western Center Authority Board for terms effective immediately and expiring 12-31-24, or until a successor is duly appointed. The Committee approved filing this item at its meeting on 5-12-20.","Here is a summary conveying the core objectives, proposed initiatives, reasoning, and relevant background for the presentation:

The presentation focused on the appointments to the National Western Authority board. There were concerns raised by several council members about ensuring proper resident representation from the impacted neighborhoods on the board.

Specifically, the key issues were:

1. One of the proposed appointees (Mr. House) does not live in the neighborhood, whereas previously there had been a resident voting member representing the community's interests. Council members Sandoval and Torres objected to this, arguing it goes against the original intent of having direct resident voting representation.

2. There were questions about which current board members were cycling off and being replaced by these new appointees. More clarity was needed on the overall composition of the board.

3. Council member CdeBaca proposed potentially swapping the voting/non-voting roles of the two appointees if that was allowable based on the requirements.

4. Council member Kashmann raised concerns about appointing someone (the 3rd appointee) who had previously worked for an organization and then was being appointed to that organization's board soon after, citing potential conflicts of interest.

The core objective was to ensure the National Western Authority board had proper community representation, especially from residents directly impacted by the National Western projects and initiatives. 

Based on the lack of clarity around current board composition and representation, as well as the concerns raised, Council member Kashmann motioned to refer the appointments back to committee for further review and discussion. This was seconded and approved to allow more information gathering before confirming the appointments.",0.6799999999999999,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, key points, and underlying context first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Agenda Item number eight Resolution 316723. Affirming Seattle City Council's commitment to high quality, locally produced broadcast news to effectively inform the public in the case of emergencies. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended, with councilmembers Gonzalez and Burgess and Swanson in favor of Councilmember Bagshaw abstained. So I have Councilmember Gonzales as the chair, but I'll let Councilman Gonzales or Councilmember Swan decide how they like to proceed on this. I think since we have some amendments, there's a couple of different ways that we can proceed on this. We can first consider the first, have Councilmember Sawant give a description of the resolution that she co-sponsored, along with Councilmember Herbold, and that we discussed in my committee hearing last week. And then perhaps it would be best at that point to consider the amendments if a council president. You're amenable to that. That's the I would suggest proceeding. That makes absolutely good sense to me. Councilmember Swan, she'd like to describe this resolution. Thank you, Fresno. I'd like to thank all the activists from ISC and IBEW 46 who were instrumental in bringing us this resolution. They represent workers in television news in general and at King five in particular, where they are involved in contract negotiations at the present time. And thank you, member Gonzalez, for coordinating this through your committee this year as IFC and IBEW negotiate a contract that defends their members, all the workers in the field, they're also being forced to defend the public in general and our rights to locally produced news with social values such as essential emergency notifications. That is because the whole television news industry is changing, and many of these changes are natural, inevitable and even desired. Because as technology changes, I think we need our infrastructure to evolve. Part of the change is the change in the function of airwaves from broadcast television to wi fi. And these are positive reflections of technological advancements. But some of the changes are motivated purely by a drive for greater profit by private corporations rather than for any public good. And that technological changes are being used as an excuse or a cover to bring in undesirable changes. Let's be clear that privatization and consolidating the media by corporate conglomerates has nothing to do with technological innovation. Unfortunately, what's happening is that more and more media companies are being conglomerated into a few mega-corporations. Here in Seattle, King five has been bought by a conglomerate called Tegna Inc. to maximize their profits going five. Tegna is attempting to shift away from professional, locally produced quality news and replacing it with rebroadcasting nationally produced news bits. This is bad for quality unionized jobs at King five, but it is also bad for the quality of the news coverage for the people in Seattle. In particular, we should be concerned about their future reliability and ability to report necessary information during disasters or other emergencies. If this trend continues, especially in the context of the FCC public airwaves auction this summer. To be clear, this is a resolution, and through this resolution, the City Council does not have a legal mandate on Tegna Inc. or any other body to act in public interest. But it will register the formal opinion of the Seattle City Council in support of the workers in broadcast media and in support of the public interest in the media, and in a way that the activists from IOC and IBEW can immediately use in their contract negotiations and in their ongoing struggle. And for this reason, I think it is very important, please, to support this resolution. This resolution passed through committee. And I thank all the organizers, again, who are standing up to powerful media conglomerates for the public good. Thank you, Councilmember Swan. Before we get into the any possible amendments, are there any other comments from the as far as the base legislation is concerned? And Councilman Baxter, I believe you would like to propose an amendment. Thank you very much. I would move to amend Resolution 31673 by substituting version three for version two. Is there a second on the amendment? Second. There is a second. Okay, so why don't you discuss why you would like to do this and what it sort of adds or detracts. All right. Thank you very much. First, I do want to acknowledge the hard work from IBEW 46 and also the I had C 600. And there's absolutely no doubt in my mind that the direction that we're going with this resolution is the appropriate one. But my concern was in being accurate in our language and using the act, the accurate language in the resolution about channel sharing. I am not debating at all by my amendment whether or not amateurs should be providing our network news. Absolutely not. And also, I will be the first to confess that I'm an amateur when it comes to it language. So I asked for some help from one of the experts that I really appreciate. So what I was what my amendments do is clean up language that I want to make sure that the were accurate when we're talking about channel sharing. We recognize that the advances in technology in the amount of spectrum that's required to broadcast a television signal has decreased because of the changes. We also recognize that there is space that was formerly reserved for one television channel. It can now fit multiple channels. So I don't want to debate whether or not the FCC encouraging TV is the appropriate thing to do or whether we've got corporations that are greedy. What we do know is that channel sharing approach will free up spectrum for wireless spectrum that could be used for other purposes. That is my goal and my intention here in the language is simply to be accurate upon the language that is being proposed. Because I do want to make sure that just as we are providing for professional clarity, using professionals when we broadcast that we too are expressing ourselves clearly and accurately in our resolutions. Thank you very much. Any responses or concerns? What would you like to respond to, Councilman? Bank shots, amendment or would anyone else like to speak to it? I would like to speak to her, but I wanted to see if other council members want to go before me. Well, I'll I'll give a I'll give a shot at it here. Number one is I do appreciate the fact that this was provided by the customers want I think weeks in advance and that she was very transparent in going about it and talked to labor. And one reason why I'm supporting the base legislation is because for me it's all about jobs, it's about local jobs, it's all about the integrity of the reporting process. And so I think that I'm very happy that customers want brought forth the resolution, that the new language is somewhat technical, and I appreciate that. Councilmember Bagshaw went through the great pains of talking, I believe, to our share loss of technology and other technology folks to sort of describe what's happening in the FCC world and what's happening with the spectrum. And I just I'm not comfortable supporting it. So I will be voting against the amendment and sticking with the base legislation unless the chair, in her opinion, feels as though it is neatly aligned with the point of the resolution. But absent that sort of strong endorsement, at least from my standpoint, I'll be I won't be supporting the amendments. But again, I'm all ears from all of my colleagues. If I may, and Councilmember Gonzales. And I'll let you speak. Sure. I'm I'm I'm also not going to support the amendments. I think that while I understand Councilmember Bag Shaw's perspective, as I think I see them reflected within the additional whereas clauses, I do think that the language that is removed from the resolution ends up in a resolution that I think doesn't hit at the heart of what the resolution is intended to address from the advocates perspective, and I think from the sponsors perspective, which is to really put a focus on not just how we do this technologically in terms of what spectrum and what's broadband and all of those other fancy words that I'm going to stop throwing around because I probably am using them incorrectly , but really focuses on the value of making sure that whatever those channels are or whatever those channels may be that they are, that there is a priority placed on making sure that they are not privately owned and that they maintain integrity of the publicly owned broadcast waves. And so I want to make sure that the resolution stays true to what I think that purpose and that intent is, and for that reason will not be supporting the amendments. So I have a quick question here and maybe this just to our clerks. I can count votes. Perhaps it would be just better if I withdraw this amendment and we vote on the bass. Okay. Well, that could save some debate time. And before I relinquish Florida councilman, she wants to if she has any closing remarks, I want to thank all of the folks that came out or even from Portland for your great testimony and your support. It really means a lot, at least to me. And I'm sure my colleagues, we listen to community members and leaders in these areas and so thank you for being here. Councilmember Swan, you'd like to say any closing words before we take a vote? Just that it's really a positive thing when elected bodies hold themselves accountable to working people and not to telecommunications corporations or big business of any kind. So I think this resolution will be a good step forward and help workers specifically in their contract negotiations. Thank you for that. Any other further comments from my colleagues? Okay. To be clear, the amendment has been withdrawn by Councilmember Bagshaw and she said she can count votes. Okay, let's proceed. Those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i. I. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries and the resolution is stopped and the chair will sign it. Very good. Agenda item number nine, please. Please read it into the record.",A RESOLUTION affirming the Seattle City Council’s commitment to high quality locally produced broadcast news to effectively inform the public in the case of emergencies.,"Here is a focused summary conveying the core elements of the presentation:

This presentation covered a resolution affirming Seattle City Council's commitment to supporting high-quality, locally produced broadcast news to effectively inform the public, especially during emergencies. The key points and context are:

- The resolution was sponsored by Council Members Sawant and Herbold, driven by activists from unions representing TV news workers like IBEW Local 46 and IATSE Local 600.

- The concern is that media consolidation by large corporations like Tegna Inc (which acquired KING 5) is leading to a shift away from professional, locally-produced news in favor of re-broadcasting national content to cut costs. 

- This is seen as detrimental to both quality journalism jobs and the ability to provide reliable emergency information to the local Seattle public.

- While an FCC spectrum auction enables technological advances, the unions argue corporations are exploiting this to prioritize profits over public interest obligations with locally-relevant programming.

- The resolution doesn't legally mandate actions, but formally voices the Council's support for broadcast media workers and the public's interest in local news coverage.

- Council Member Bagshaw proposed amendments to clarify technical language around channel sharing and spectrum usage, but withdrew them due to lack of support prioritizing the resolution's intent to back local news integrity over consolidation.

- Ultimately, the original resolution affirming commitment to local broadcast news was passed, with the Council siding with the unions' arguments against corporatized media models.",0.8750000000000002,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, key points, and underlying context first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Communication from Councilman Andrews, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Council Member, Super Knob. Vice Mayor Richardson recommendation to request the city manager to assemble a business retention team to develop a strategy and identify all available benefits and opportunities to attract and retain. Molina Health Care's key operations and health care services in the city of Long Beach. Thank you, Councilman Andrews. Yes, thank you, Mayor. I want to thank the vice mayor Richardson and Councilwoman Gonzalez and Councilmember Supernormal for their support in this item. The Molina health care has been a wonderful partner to the city of Long Beach. And while we do not know whether that whether their next steps are, I will decide them in the attempt to have our city reach out to Merlino and see what assistance we may provide within health care. As one of the top ten employees in our city and we always talk about think high and we always talk about hiring local and being business friendly. Any retention term team that will truly reflect that? I have a brief staff report, but one of my staff members. Honorable Mayor and members of the City Council. Councilmember Andrews is requesting council support in assembling a business retention team for Molina Health Care. What first began as a clinic in Long Beach serving low income patients over 35 years ago, has flourished. Into a Fortune. 500 company pioneering the health care field, servicing our community and many others nationwide. Of the top ten employers in Long Beach Molina Healthcare is one of three companies hiring locally. Being that job stability and local employment are priorities for the city, it is imperative we take proactive measures to assist and engage in discussion with Molina health care regarding its future. In lieu of Molina's recent challenges, both the mayor and city manager have been in contact with Molina efforts we recognize and appreciate and assembling a business retention team. We are requesting the involvement of all necessary departments, agencies, leaders and officials to explore every option that could assist Molina health care in remaining in the city . If there is an opportunity to expand, we want Molina to expand here. Most importantly. We want to retain Molina health care here in Long Beach, servicing our communities and hiring our residents. This concludes my staff report. Our team will be happy to answer any of your questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. No, I like to have the mayor speak on the side of me, if you don't mind. Thank you. I just wanted to add a few things. I appreciate the councilman's efforts in and out of staff. I know that there's been a lot of conversations around this. I just wanted to add that I've been in close contact with the incoming and the new CEO of Molina Health Care. Mr. White and I actually spoke just yesterday here at City Hall, and he wanted to be clear in our conversation, and I'm clear with him that, you know, MOLINA health care is 100% committed to Long Beach and Long Beach is 100% committed to Molina health care. And so I felt very strong and very heartened by the conversations and the leadership of of of the new CEO. They love and value Long Beach and they value their employees. And I just want to thank him and his team for for being great partners. And I appreciate Councilman Andrews, his efforts as well. I think anything that we can do to continue to work with Molina health care and ensure that they have the resources that they need to be competitive, we will continue to do and will and in addition always want to do more. And so I just wanted to thank the council, but just make sure that the public also knew that we're very active in conversations. And and I believe that health care will continue to be a strong partner in Long Beach. So thank you, Councilman. Thank you. Yeah. You know what's good? Well, I do when I go through the the speaker's list here. So. Councilman Gonzales. Yes. Thank you to Councilmember Andrews for bringing this forward. And I see Mark and Isaac here as well from Molina Health Care. And I want to thank them. And Steve. That's right, Steve Neal. Hello, Steve. I have glasses on and I still can't see. So I want to thank each of you for being here. You know, Molina, health care would a large employer in our city. And so having an ability to have this retention team that can work together to ensure that whether community or whether a business is thinking of expanding or even divesting, investing, reinvesting again into our city, that we have as much of a presence and we have a much of a plan put together to ensure that they continue working in the city of Long Beach as much as possible. I know that this was a hard pill to swallow for a lot of us, and I know change is always difficult. But at the same time, this is a fantastic corporation that we want to keep here in Long Beach. I would also like to ask, just in general with business retention, you know, just keeping I know that our economic development does such a great job in making sure that we have line of sight to that, but maybe highlighting that a bit more. So we have even better line of sight and better communication so we as elected officials can assist in any way possible. Sometimes we get in the way, I will admit. But sometimes, you know, if we can assist in any way, that would be great. And so I think the Economic Development Department, I think Molina Health care and I think Councilmember Andrews for bringing this forward, I look forward to future discussions. Mayor. Thank you. We have Councilman Pearce. Great. I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. And I think everybody from Allina health care for being here today. I do look forward to hearing from you guys. And I know that you guys have continued to invest in the city. And while we're talking about expansion and providing health care in other areas of the region, I have no doubt that, you know, your home in Long Beach is one that we feel very proud of and that we're working really closely with you guys. And so I just look forward to hearing from you all and finding out how this team can really, you know, what are the challenges that we're trying to address and how we can really make sure we're focusing on those real challenges and but still allowing us to focus on providing services as much as possible to so many of the seniors and so many other people in our residents that benefit from your services being here. So thank you. Vice Mayor. Thank you, Mayor. I wanted to thank Councilman Andrews for asking us to sign in on this. I also want to acknowledge you and your team. I think this presentation, the fact that we can highlight that this is the ninth largest employer in our city, really justifies why we have this agenda item today. I think when it comes to employment, when it comes to, you know, retaining talent and retaining business interests in our city, this is a strong message that we're sending. The fact that the entire city council's queued up to speak on this, I think sends a strong message to incoming leadership and to the existing employees that actually work for Molina health care and live here and count on it. I've got a Molina Clinic in my district. I think it sends a strong message that we're all hands on deck and we do want to support the success of that business and see a continuing partnership in our city. So, so congratulate so thank you for bringing this forward. And I want to sort of monitor the progress of this and make sure that we we do keep Molina in Long Beach. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Councilman Ringa. Thank you, Mayor. I'm a little confused on the on the sale. I'm not really clear as to what the purpose of this item is being brought forward here. Why it's being brought here for there may wait here, as the mayor said. I think that the organization is already committed to Long Beach and it's going to be staying here in Long Beach. The way I read this item is that there's a concern that maybe Molina health care is going to be leaving Long Beach, and we should create this committee to look at how we can keep them here. I'm not sure what that would entail. Would that entail some tax incentives without taking some kind of breaks? Some additional. Monetary concerns that they would have to keep them here and keep them from moving. So I'm not real clear in terms of what this means or what the purpose of it is. If it's an opportunity for us to look into maybe helping them. As I heard earlier today, getting in a parking structure or providing some kind of land use assistance, I could see that. However, they are a private business and and as a private entity, they can do pretty much what they want in regards to either staying or leaving. It's not up to us to decide that. And I would I would be concerned spending public funds, public moneys to retain a private organization here in Long Beach when actually they could do whatever they want. It's their prerogative whether to stay or not. But if it's true that they want to stay in Long Beach, then I don't I don't see the concern with this with this item here, because they already are committed here. So what is it that we are trying to do here? I've heard two words that that they have a concern to me, and that is that one is that this is a proactive effort to help keep moving health care in Long Beach. And the other is is is this a preemptive effort to keep building health care in Long Beach? So those two words are somewhat confusing in the sense that if it's a a proactive effort that they ask has well in health care, asked for assistance, in wanting in having them stay here in Long Beach. And therefore, we're creating this committee to help to see how we can do that. And if it's and if they didn't, then why are we doing this? And if it's a preemptive effort, what is it based on facts that they already are making some moves to leave Long Beach? And we want to make sure that we keep them here by creating some kind of effort that will help them reconsider and stay in Long Beach. So there's still some there's still some unanswered questions that I have in regards to what is the total intent of creating this this committee to look at the health care. And finally, the thing that I see here is it's creating the president for other businesses who might say, I want to leave Long Beach, but if you help me, I'll stay. And then there we go. It starts. It starts a slippery slope where we have other kinds of businesses wanting to have that kind of that same assistance that we give to one entity. So we're going to do two for one. We have to start looking at giving it for all. And I'm not sure that that's the direction that I want to take on this. So I'm looking forward to some further discussion you'll find. Thank you for those questions and I'll have my chief of staff. John, would you please elaborate on that, please? Sure. On the mayor, council members, what? There is no insider information or anything like that. I think that just as an observer. Councilman Andrews, there's a lot of residents of the sixth District who are firmly in health care. John and Mario represented sort of the heart and soul and a very unique relationship with this city and with their departure. As we know, corporations typically are courted and have other business decisions that are part of their profile. So there's a shake up that took place. We're all aware of it. There's assurances that they have no intentions of leaving. However, 400 employees were placed across the bridge. And we we have some vacancy rate in corporate buildings here in Long Beach. And the item calls for outside of the city support as well. And so as we look at the health care debate on a national level, we are also having a debate at the state level and how we can work with strategic partners at the county and at the state level to do everything that we can. Because as it shows here, there's there's only a handful of companies that actually reside in Long Beach that do business here. And everybody from states, governors and mayors and whatnot are trying to attract and retain corporate presence in their cities because it creates a lifeline, because those employees then get coffees and dry cleaning and all the things that that are in ancillary businesses that are supported. So I guess the the intent really in being proactive is that we don't allow an opportunity for 400 more employees to reside here in Long Beach. The preemptive nesses that is to allow other stakeholders, as well as the city of Long Beach, to be a partner with us to make sure that they continue to have their their their national headquarters here in Long Beach. That was that was the intent behind it. We have the same assurances that the mayor has received, but it's just making sure that all strategic partners are at the table and that we are making sure that we are provided we have outside governance trying to take companies from the state. We have other cities that are trying to take companies from other cities. And we have to make sure that we stay competitive in making sure that we provide those opportunities. Thank you. Councilmember Kasim Reed is and anything else on that? Okay. Well, I'm gonna go I'm going to have I have councilman also next. Yeah. Thank you. And I appreciate this this discussion. And I appreciate the item coming forward. This is a this one kind of hits home. It's a bittersweet because and I was around in 1995 as an aerospace worker working with my my union as a representative in 1995 when the first red team was established, when this this practice that we are looking at today was actually put into motion. And at the time, it was a. Aircraft called the empty M.D. 95 that was being proposed to be built in another state. We fought we worked with Create a Red Team, and we were able to keep those jobs, about 10,000 aerospace jobs paying aircraft jobs here in Long Beach. Since then, several red teams have been established. And, you know, Boeing went from number one employer here in Long Beach. Now they're number seven. And I'm going to challenge that number because I'm not even sure they're number seven anymore in terms of employees in the city. I think this is a and I want to commend, you know, Councilmember Andrews and the rest of my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think this is a a noble gesture. And we were all, I think, taken aback by the recent shake up within the Molina health care organization. However, I'm my question is, is similar to what Councilmember Urunga is regarding the threat. Right. And there has been no public information. There has been no indication in my that I've heard of that there is a threat of losing jobs here in the city. And so the question is, okay, what harm is it going to be to put forth a a business retention team or a red team of local, county, state officials, economic development professionals, private partners to to show goodwill and so forth, in terms of, you know, our intent in will to keep the Molina health care here, but short of a a real threat, I'm not sure that that is going to be a useful use of of of time for for what kind of strategies are going on where we are really talk about once we get to the table. Right. What type of leverage is there going to be once we get to the table? Everybody, I think if you were to go to the county of Los Angeles, you can go to the state of California. You can see. This. This body here is going to say, hey, we want to keep jobs in long. These jobs here in Molina, health care here in the city of Long Beach. So if I could offer just a a friendly solution, I don't even want to necessarily make it a substantive motion. But I think this body would be better served by pushing forth in a resolution stating that our strong support and and our will to keep jobs and work with Molina help health care to keep jobs here. I don't know that putting together a business retention team or a red team is necessarily good use of resources at this time. Like I said, I commend it. I support the the the ideal in in concept. But I'm not sure that that that that is the best use of time and resources at this particular juncture. I do recognize it is a privately traded company. It's a it's a it's a private entity. They both did made decisions to leave anyway. Right. Based on markets and whatever else. And we had every every resource in place to do that. Private companies are loyal to 2 to 1 thing, and that is their profits. And so I'm going to end my comments with that. Because I've experienced it. I've seen 40,000 plus jobs leave Long Beach, and we had the same motto in place to keep it in place. Right. And so I'm not trying to turn my back on any way in any way on on the employees or the and the good people. MOLINA Health care. I want to make sure I support the jobs here, but I want to make sure that we're smart with how we direct our staff and our resources moving forward. When I was going to finish, yeah, because I'm going to stay with it, go back. To my company name, I make some comments. Okay, if and with the friendly, I'm going to, you know, deny that because I'm going to stay with what the mayor was saying when he said he spoke with them. And they believe in what they're saying. And I think I'm going to stick with that. Well, so let me let me just let me just let me just add and be very clear and I'll just repeat what I mentioned to to the new CEO is the city of Long Beach is is completely committed to mining health care. And I and I have assurances that Molina health care is completely committed to Long Beach. And so we are partners. We'll continue to be partners. Obviously, there's I think that the interests of Council of of the councilmember, from what I understand it, is to ensure that we are doing everything possible just to ensure that we are providing our our largest private employer with as much support as possible in the employees as possible. So I understand, Councilman, you know what? Where you guys are coming from, I think the councilman's intention is to ensure that our city team is in constant communication with Molina health care. And we're doing everything we can to ensure that all those jobs stay here locally in Long Beach. And so I think that's the intention. But I also just want to make it clear that Molina is moving forward. And I think I think that the Mina family has a long history in this community and they continue to be involved in the company. So I just want to make sure that's also very clear. They are still part of of of the company. And and we're very happy to have them here. Councilman Austin. So in light of the fact that the friendly was denied, I'd like to just put forth a substitute motion to have the city council or instruct the city manager to prepare a resolution or I'm sorry, the city attorney to prepare a resolution stating the council's full support for maintaining jobs. Molina Healthcare jobs in the city of Long Beach and the city's full support to maintain a constant communication with Molina health care. And should issues come up, we will be in place to to to work with them to maintain jobs in the future moving forward. Okay. That's a substitute motion which is on the floor. Councilman Gonzales. Well, I'd like to support Councilmember Andrews original motion. And although I understand the resolution piece, perhaps something that could be of benefit is instead of maybe it's just an issue of semantics because we're calling it business retention, perhaps it can just be called the business support team because that's really what it is. And so I know retention often looks like a threat. There doesn't have to be a threat necessarily in order for us to just support a corporation. And so I think we can go back to the original motion. I think that would be perhaps a little bit more beneficial in this in the essence of this item, and would certainly put us on the map in terms of supporting large corporations for the jobs, for everything else. So that would be my recommendation. Okay. So that's going to be the recommendation to you, Councilman Andrews. Okay. Next up is Councilman Ringo. Thank you very much. Again, I don't want to I don't want to basically disparage. Whatever it is, we're putting forward the original motion. That is not my intent. I have a total, total, complete respect for Bolivian health care. There's no question the impact they've had on this city, they put us on the map, Fortune 500, company, even 100 at one point. What their their value to Long Beach is absolutely unprecedented. They are our pride and joy, but they're a private entity and we are a public entity. And my concern is that by putting together this red team, we're spending public funds for a private effort. And I'm not sure that we're in we're in line with something that we should be doing. I do support the resolution. I seconded the motion because we should let Molina health care know that we are totally concerned about their current restructuring and reorganization. That always happens with every company concerned. Ross had mentioned that, and we've seen it everywhere, across across the economic spectrum, that when a company buys out another company or acquires another company and there's always a restructuring going there, whenever that happens, there's going to be a loss, there's going to be loss of jobs, there's going to be a restructuring, there's going to be a reorganization, and there's going to be movement. Whether it's complete and total exiting the home base and going somewhere else. That's a private decision. That's a business decision. They're business decision. It would be our loss and we would be totally devastated by having that happen. And we don't want to happen. That's why this is a as it's been characterized as a preemptive effort to already talk to them, to make to assure them, to tell them that we're there for you, but they haven't come to us for that. They're not asking for that. At least I haven't heard it yet. But when that day if that day comes, we will be there for them. I'm sure we will, because we all all I've heard here is that we we love Molina health care. We want them to stay here. But that's not we're not there yet. And so we're building a red team. I know it says right here that there's no fiscal impact. There is a fiscal impact. There's going to be obviously we're going to we're going to put staff, resources and time into a rare team locations, meetings to be to be arranged materials, pre-prepared research should be done. There is going to be an economic impact. How much is it? I don't know. Maybe it's minimal, a few thousand dollars. But it's still an impact. And it's still public funding. Public funding for a private purpose. So I'm still having issues with that. I second the motion to send them a resolution strongly supporting their they're staying in Long Beach and if there is an opportunity for them that that they want to look at in terms of moving to another location, we want to be the first ones to counter anything that that that they might be hearing. If they're hearing a better land use opportunity in Texas, so be it. But give us an opportunity to counter it. And we could do it and let the the bidding begin, if you will. But I'm just not I'm just not very supportive of having public funds going for a public company, for a private company, and then creating opportunities for other such businesses who might be in Long Beach. I don't know. I'm not going to if I start naming so companies, I'll probably get into trouble. So I'm not going to do that. But but the problem is, is that there are the companies that might want to do the same thing. You know, there are other big companies. They might not be one of the top ten up here. But if you look at that top ten, you know, at least six of them are private companies. I mean, excuse me, are publicly funded companies lobby state. I'll be CC. St Mary's is a nonprofit Veterans Affairs. I mean, you know, a lot of those guys that they're they're public agencies for those we could do that we did it we did it a few years back a few years back 20 years ago with with the Naval Shipyard, with the Veterans Affairs and Navy Hospital. At those points, I could see the validity of having a red team and working with with our, our sister and brother governmental agencies or public agencies to retain their their services here . But and this this is this is a different situation. And it calls for a different approach, a different strategy. And I don't think this one is the right one to use for that one. Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I just want to take a moment and express my full and strong support for Councilman Andrews and the Molina health care team. I do understand and I believe the council is in the right place in terms of where they want to go. I want to make sure that we don't miss the forest while searching for the right tree. I think both send a strong message and we have a very capable team. We just reorganized the established economic development department, which we've been treating as sort of our red team, if you will, and if by changing language here, there, semantics here, there about support or retention. I think we can very easily say Diana Ting, who handles our state legislation and our county stuff. Our new deputy city manager. Let's get him off the bench. You know, take a look at what resources are around. It wouldn't take very much to say, let's have a discussion. I want to thank the mayor for leading that conversation. But to me, I think it's my opinion when you take that extra step of saying I'm here and so is my experts and my team. What can we do to make sure you understand that we are that you are important to us? So what I don't want to do here is send the wrong message that somehow the council is not unified. I would hope that we can support Councilman Andrew's motion here and give staff the flexibility to do more or less based on the circumstances at the table or on the ground. And even if there is no threat, it's okay. When's the last time you know someone who says, you know, I learned this from Shannon McKee? Actually, it was. When do you how often do businesses get? You know, do we approach businesses and say, how? How can we just help you do more of what you already do? Right. This is just another opportunity to do that, as far as I'm concerned. So I will just ask that we hope hopefully we can get back to Councilman Andrew's original motion. We can be unified as a city and leave some flexibility city manager and the mayor to use what tools they see fit here. Thanks. Councilman Ranga. Because Vice Mayor Richardson, I read I'm like I say, I take offense to what you said because it's not true that it's not my intent. The intent of the substitute motion is not to divide this council. We all are in unison in the praise and the love that we have for our health care. We're dealing with emotion here. We're not dealing with with whether we want or need a health care to stay or not. It's a it's a it's a process. It's a it's a a a strategy, an approach. That's all we're talking about here. We're not we're not talking about whether we vote for or against Councilmember Andrews resolution. You know, you're you're you're either with me or against me. That has nothing to do with that. Let's stop that, because that's not what this is about. This is about how do we send the message to Molina health care or to any business, for that matter, that it might be suffering from any kind of economic downturn? Just tell them to show them that we care, that we want them here, but we want them here under the the understanding that if and when they come to us for help, we are going to be there. This is not doing this motion. The original motion does not do that. It doesn't. You might think it does, but it doesn't. It say that, you know, we're afraid that you're going to leave us. Let us help. Let us. Let us work with you to help you stay here. That that's not that. I think that's a wrong approach. We don't need to do that. If they want to stay, they're going to stay. They want to leave. They're going to leave. It's a it's a business decision on their part. And all we can do at this point is try to help them stay here. We can do that. But trying to be preemptive and proactive, I think is that's the wrong message. We can work with them. We can work for them. But I don't think that we could say, you know, you're going to see him. We're going to keep you here no matter what. We're going to make sacrifices. I think that's the wrong message. Question I got one more. So, Councilman Austin. Mr. Mayor, I just had a question for you. Since you are the chief executive of the city of Long Beach, you had a conversation with the new CEO of Molina Health Care. Did you have any indication that jobs were at risk here in the city of Long Beach? From Molina health care during your conversation. I mean, I think I think we have to be honest in any conversation with any corporation. You know, you can never say never. And whether that's Molina health care or that or whether that's the ice cream shop down the street. And so I think I think you we should never assume that any job, regardless of who holds it or where it is, is always going to remain in the city. What I feel completely committed to is Melina healthcare's commitment to Long Beach. Their headquarters is here. They've got multiple operations here, and they're growing. They have a new they have the new leadership. So of course, there will be changes, but that's part of it. And I think that we will continue. I'm very confident that the partnership between Melina and Long Beach will continue strongly for for many, many years ahead. And so I am not concerned that that there is going to be some sort of large change. I think I think Melina is a great company, and I think we'll look forward to working with them in the future . Thank you. And your words right now make me validate, I think the motion to pass a resolution, a strong resolution, a strongly worded resolution stating our commitment to to helping keep jobs here should the need arise. But doesn't sound like there's a need here. And I would rather use our valuable staff resources to economic development on our business corridors and in our neighborhoods, in growing our sales tax base where we can grow that. That's where I'd like to see our economic development department and our city management team be be focused on right now, focused on developing and creating new business, new jobs, new economic opportunities. And not going after something is not moving right. So that's that's that's that's my big rationale. And members I would ask you to support the resolution, I think is a smart approach, but do as you will. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. We have a. A secondary motion and I'm in motion. I have to do public comment. So let me do public comment and we'll come back to the council. Any public comment on this? Okay. CNN So we have a substitute motion on the floor, which is a resolution of support by Councilman Austin and Councilman Ringa . So please cast your vote on the substitute motion first. Motion fails. Okay. We're now back to the original motion, which I believe Councilman Andrews accepted the friendly from Councilmember Gonzalez, which was to frame this as a business support team. Councilman Andrews, is that correct? Yes. Okay. Please cast your vote on that. Motion carries. Okay. Thank you. Motion carries. And we'll go on to the next item. Madam Clerk. I think we'll do 24.","Recommendation to request City Manager to assemble a business retention team for Molina Healthcare comprised of all necessary departments, county and state agencies, business leaders, economic development officials, and Molina Healthcare executives, to develop a strategy and identify all available benefits and opportunities to attract and retain Molina Healthcare's key operations and health care services in the City of Long Beach.","Thank you for providing the full transcript. To effectively summarize this presentation, I will first internalize the core elements through free-form reasoning, then provide a focused summary structured for clear communication.

Free-Form Reasoning:
The central issue is whether to assemble a ""business retention/support team"" to aid in keeping Molina Healthcare's operations and jobs in Long Beach. Molina is a major Fortune 500 company and one of the city's top employers, hiring locally. Recent executive changes at Molina have prompted concerns about potential shifts in their local presence.

While the Mayor states he has assurances from Molina's new CEO that they are committed to Long Beach, some council members see value in proactively demonstrating the city's support and willingness to assist Molina. However, others question spending public resources on a private company absent a specific request or threat of Molina leaving. There are also concerns about setting a precedent for other businesses to seek similar treatment.

The discussion navigates finding the right approach - whether a formal ""support team"", a resolution expressing the council's commitment to retaining Molina's jobs, or relying on existing economic development efforts. Underlying it all is agreement on Molina's importance to the city's economy and pride in having their headquarters located in Long Beach.

Focused Summary:
The Long Beach City Council discussed potential measures to affirm the city's support for retaining the local operations and jobs of Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Long Beach. While the Mayor stated he received assurances from Molina's new CEO about their commitment to the city, some council members proposed creating a ""business support team"" involving city departments to proactively assist Molina. 

Others questioned expending public resources without a specific threat of Molina leaving, preferring a resolution expressing the council's unified backing for keeping those jobs in Long Beach. After deliberation, the council approved Councilman Andrews' original motion, amended to frame it as assembling a ""business support team"" to collaborate with Molina Healthcare on opportunities for retention and growth in the city.  

All council members emphasized Molina's invaluable role as a top local employer providing thousands of jobs, and their desire to be a cooperative partner supporting the company's continued success operating from its Long Beach headquarters.",0.88,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, key points, and underlying context first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Thank you. I'm going to turn this over. I know we have a pretty large presentation or in-depth presentation. I know the council obviously had some closed session conversations on this. And so now we're having an open, open session discussion. So. Mr. West. Yes, Mr. Mayor. Council members, as we all know, the Garrison Group inherited this project from Save the Queen. The Garrison Group isn't a land developer. So what we're doing tonight will facilitate urban commons to take over the lease. They will be a land developer for those 45 acres, as well as managing the queen. And Mike Conway is going to give us the details of this restated lease and presentation. Thank you, Mr. West. Mayor Garcia, members of the City Council. This item involves the Queen Mary leasehold and staff's recommendation to enter restated lease with the proposed successor, lessee. Give us an investment group. Our current lessee seeks to assign its interest in the Queen Mary leasehold to urban commons, the proposed successor lessee and for the city and urban commons to enter a restated lease that will continue first class operations of the ship. Secure ongoing funding for historic restoration and preservation. And stimulate shoreside development. And increase the stature of this important city asset. From a visual perspective, the Queen Mary leasehold includes the ship and surrounding and rackmount 43 acres of adjoining land and 11.5 acres of adjoining water area. The leasehold includes the ship, the Spruce Goose Dome, access to the Carnival Cruise Lines dock, a joint parking garage, surface parking a sublease to a Catalina Express and a separate lease that allows limited use of the events park. Further from a visual perspective, access to the leasehold is restricted by the southerly terminus of the 710 Freeway, which is severely impacted by Port Trucking uses. And its access is primarily from the Magnolia Avenue Bridge. And as background, in 1995, the city entered a 66 year lease with Queen Queens Seaport Development Inc, controlled by Joseph Predator, who in 2005 declared bankruptcy due to nonpayment of percentage rent. In 2007, Save the Queen LLC purchased the leasehold interest out of bankruptcy. In 2009, Save the Queen defaulted on its loan from Garrison Development Group, who subsequently took over day to day management of the Queen Mary. Under terms of the bankruptcy agreement, Garrison completed over $5.3 million in capital improvements on the ship. In 2011, Garrison completed an historic inventory report, which identified over 4700 historically significant items on the ship, and they also hired Evolution Hospitality to operate the ship. Evolution has brought such signature events as chill and distinctive exhibits such as Princess Diana, which have served to increase attendance and hotel occupancy and improve the public recognition and reputation of the Queen Mary. Additionally, Garrison continued his financial investment into the leasehold by completing over $8 million in additional upgrades to restaurants, retail stores, hotel amenities, historic restoration and new exhibits. More recently, in cooperation with city staff, Garrison developed a conservation management plan and is in the process to complete a Historic Structures Report and Marine survey and another noteworthy success with the completion of the fire alarm upgrade and certification. This slide provides a partial list of the upgrades and renovations that Garrison has funded and implemented with Evolution, Hospitality and the historic resource advisor, John Thomas. And resulting from these significant capital investments. Updated, upgraded. Guestrooms and restaurants. Unique and attractive. Attractive exhibits and widely popular special events. The Queen Mary has received many awards and accolades since Garrison and Evolution have managed the Queen Mary. Additionally, Garrison has delivered on the requirements established through the Bankruptcy Court, as demonstrated in reports prepared by the city auditor. Now. I'll go through a few before and after pictures. This is the first one of the signature smoked smokestacks of the Queen Mary, which are freshly painted. State room upgrades which have improved the guest experience. Renovation of the Promenade Café, which has improved the look and feel of this eating venue. Similarly, Sir Winston's, the Queen Mary's sophisticated eating establishment has been superbly renovated, receiving enthusiastically positive reviews. Chelsea Chowder House now has a more intimate and classical dining atmosphere. The Queen's Salon has been transformed into a first class venue, and the main entrance has been spruced up a little bit and added some modernization. And one of the more overwhelming tasks is maintaining the teak deck, which is an ongoing event. But when completed, the difference is truly astounding. So Garrison's successes. So since 2009, the status of the Queen Mary can only be described as a success. Garrison has invested over $13 million in capital improvements, upgrades and restoration. Garrison An evolution has brought us Churchill, the Princess Diana exhibit and many historic restorations to original character and quality. City staff believe that Garrison has an extraordinary job of maintaining and improving this unique and world renowned icon, and with evolution as their operator, have significantly enhanced the reputation of the Queen Mary and consequently of the city of Long Beach. As staff, I would like to thank Long Win and Chuck Pomeranz from Garrison, John Jenkins and Shaun Monarch Maddock on Evolution, and John Thomas, their historic resource advisor. They have not only been great partners, but extraordinary servants, stewards of this international icon who are in the audience with us this evening. And now, as City Council considers the future of the Queen Mary, it's important to recall that there are unique challenges to both hotel operations and landside development. These challenges affect land use density, market limitations, access and congestion, all of which serves to increase the risk associated with maintaining and growing hotel revenue and successful land development. These higher risks serve to require an increased level of equity and higher cost of debt than more traditional developments. And for a bit more detail, there is essentially a single point of access to the Queen Mary, which is shared by the port and its related truckers. The Queen Mary is surrounded by water and the port of Long Beach, severely limiting the market from which to draw visitors. Any development will need to draw up from up to a 60 minute driving time in order to remain successful. Also, tidelands land use restrictions is the limiting factor which serves to further increase risk and limit development. To help gauge development alternatives. Three Demand analyzes have recently been completed and the results identified three primary uses for the land. The first being a boutique hotel to supplement the Queen Mary and support Carnival Cruises. The second is an entertainment complex for special and ongoing events with support of food and beverage venues. And the third is a Mega-Yacht marina to accommodate larger personal watercraft that have limited berthing opportunities. These analysis suggested a number of entertainment uses to be considered, which include live music themed restaurants, open air markets, waterfront activities, children's entertainment and possibly college classrooms. So today, the Queen Mary is faced with a few issues. The existing lease is overly cumbersome. Percentage rent is unreliable. Carnival Cruise Line seeks to expand its presence in Long Beach and needs additional space in the Dome. Development opportunities are limited, and certain incentives are necessary in order to compel land development. And so to address these issues, four goals were identified. Number one, ensure the continued first class operation of the ship. Number two, ensure secure ongoing funding for historic restoration and preservation. Three, Ensure a well-capitalized, market driven, high quality, entertainment oriented development. And number four, ensure the availability of the dome for expanded cruise operations that increase the passenger count and enhance the guest experience. So for goal number one, staff proposes that a restated lease require the following establish a hotel operations, maintenance and furniture, fixtures and equipment fund starting at 1% of gross revenues and increasing to 3% by year five. To fund ongoing maintenance and replacements, establish a new base maintenance plan. Establish a nonprofit foundation to assist in fundraising for historic restoration. Complete and implement the Historic Preservation and Capital Investment Plan, Conservation Management Plan, Marine Survey and Historic Structures Report and prepare and implement a transition plan. Four goal two staff recommends that the restated lease require that an amount equal to current passenger fees up to $2.15 per passenger be paid to the city to be used for capital investment and historic restoration and preservation. For the first five years, this amount passed through to the city will be fixed at $2.15 million to compensate urban commons for this lost revenue. Staff recommends a preferred annual Non-Cumulative priority return of 9% on both the initial investment and eligible capital improvements. Revised percentage rent to be 10% of operating revenue above the base rent and after priority return has been paid. Base rent will continue at $300,000 per year, increasing every ten years by CPI and capped at 40%. This reflects a 3.4% annual rate and the city shall participate in net profits of any sale or refinance of the leasehold interest to a level of 25% of net proceeds for goal number three. Staff recommends extending the term of the lease to 66 years to provide for recapitalization opportunities, provide for financeable subleases for land development, require city consent for any assignments or encumbrances. Establish a land value by appraisal and require a return on land value when the land generates revenue starting at 3% and increasing to 7% over five years. Adjust the land value every ten years by CPI capped at 40%. This also reflects a 3.4% annual rate. Require implementation of financial reporting practices as recommended by the city or author auditor and require participation, support and cooperation of the Queen Mary Task Force in Development, Design, Outreach and Entitlement. And the First Queen Mary Task Force meeting has been scheduled for January 6th of 2016. So design, outreach and entitlement will finally begin. For goal number four as a result of Carnival's interest in increasing the size of its ships, servicing Long Beach and as an incentive for the successor lessee to quickly pursue development to allocate the entire Spruce Deuce Goose Dome to carnival for its passenger embarkation and disembarkation needs. And to enhance the guest experience, Garrison conducted an exhaustive search for a highly qualified and well-capitalized successor, lessee. Garrison identified urban commons as their preferred successor. Lessee and city staff has spent the last year working with urban commons to ensure that their team are sufficiently experienced, motivated and capitalized to maintain first class operations of the hotel, continue significant capital investment and historic restoration and preservation, and immediately pursue land development. Staff is pleased to join Garrison in recommending urban commons as the successor lessee. Urban Commons has assembled an impressive team to work with the Queen Mary Task Force to begin development, design and public outreach for landside development with First Harrigan, Gensler, Architects, Burnham and Associates, John Thomas and Global Hospitality Group. The Urban Commons team is ready to meet with the Queen Mary Task Force and begin its outreach efforts. As a little bit of context, this slide shows the hotels owned and or operated by Urban Commons just in California with a preponderance in Southern California. And this slide shows urban commons development projects, which are entirely in Southern California. This is the Urban Commons team headed by Howard Wu and Taylor Woods, who assembled a formidable and local team. Urban Commons will retain evolution hospitality to ensure a seamless transition, and John Thomas will continue as its historic resource officer. As development opportunities are refined through the outreach and engagement process, additional specialized team members will be added to augment expertize in market segments identified during the engagement process. So with that, staff recommends that City Council authorize the city manager to execute a restated lease and concurrent assignment to Urban Commons LLC as successor lessee to Garrison Investment Group . And this concludes my presentation. I'm available to answer questions. Thank you. Before I turn this over to Vice Mayor Lowenthal, who will lead the conversation in a being second district and being the creameries in the second District, I want to start off doing public comment first. And so if there's any members of the public that want to comment on this issue, now would be the time. It looks. Like this. I think. Smarty pants. Jim McCabe. Many of you are familiar with me. I'm a retired deputy city attorney. Just as a starter, this agenda item is pretty glaringly in violation of the Brown Act. The the agenda item doesn't even mention the Queen Mary. If you're familiar with operations agreement 22697. That's fine. But the general public is not familiar with that. This is a clear violation of the public. Oh, excuse me. That the Brown Act and I think it should be of concern to all of you, because if it's found to be null, to not be. Sufficient, what you do tonight will. Be null and void. I am informed that the city gets rent now. That was true of the lease that I wrote and I think it is principally still in effect. Please be sure that the. City. The Tidelands Beaches Recreation will receive nothing from this lease. There is $300,000 in purported rent that goes right back into the ship that we we're giving away for 66 years. A new 66 year period. We'll never get the 10% of gross revenue rent because obviously this is a net profit situation in which you'll never get any rent until. Urban gets a whopping 9% of its return on its return every year for the next 66 years. We've been told by the city manager that this is an urban development property, but nothing in the council letter mandates that any development be done. And on the land parcel and not. There is no downside for the proposed lessee if it doesn't. This is a very sweet deal for Urban entered into with almost no public notice. I appreciate your attention. I obviously answer any questions if you want to add some. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, council and mayor and control. And I agree with the previous speaker that there was no public notice given for this item. I read through. The agenda for this week. And I didn't see anything about the Queen Mary. So I am unprepared to address anything having to do with this lease. Just reading the agenda item does not give you any clue that this is about the Queen Mary. I also have a question about the developer, the land that is going to be developed along with the ship. I heard a brief mention of the events park. And I'm wondering, is this what is often what the name of this park, as I understand it, is the Harry Bridges Events Park that is near the Queen Mary. And I would like to know if that is being included in what can be developed. As I understand it, this is part of the city's parks and recreation. Parks and I question whether this can be developed. Thank you for answering any questions. Thank you. Another one, please come down, Larry. Any other public speakers besides Mr. Goodhue? Any other ones? Nope. Okay. Mr.. Good to be the final speaker. Very good. CLERK As they address the olfactory senses, they're triggered immediately when you see a 9% return. Which is a healthy or very healthy return. In today's economy. I'd like to see what you have refused and are scared to get from the city auditor relative to having her do an audit on the city hall project or didn't even get one for the port of for the courthouse. Certainly you should get one here. And I don't know, I'm not I've I'm not a financial wizard, but I know if somebody is getting 9%. Somebody else has taken it out the rear. So that boils down to and that may be the city of Long Beach. So I would suggest a thorough audit by somebody other than willy nilly and Madoff. Madoff to. And whatever the lease has. The one thing I want to make sure that is not in there is that we don't have a flea market, a farmer's market , or an arts and crafts show. And the lease should specifically prohibit those. If you're going to spend the type of dollars that you're going to use, we don't the people that are going to spend the type of dollars sufficient to get a return for that investor, aren't interested in a flea market, an arts and crafts show or anything approaching it. So make sure that lease echoes that sentiment. Thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna turn this over to the vice mayor before I do so. Just to clarify. And I was brought up. I know, Mr. City Attorney. Now, as I read the counsel item, I know that the Queen married in the first sentence of the discussion, and it opens with that. But just to confirm with you. This item clearly meets all the posting requirements and the standard legal test. That is correct. I would disagree with the speakers of under government code section 54 nine 54.2. Agenda must contain a general brief description of each item of business to be transaction transacted or discussed in here. Clearly, the. Item being discussed is the amended and restated lease. And it provides the exact least number. Thank you. With that, I'll turn this over now to Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you, Mr. City attorney. Also want to thank the speakers for sharing their thoughts about this. I know certainly some of you have been involved with the Queen Mary, at least been interested with the Queen Mary for a very long time. And that's something that we share in common. We on the council, as well as those in the community, I have been working with the Queen Mary the entire time I've been elected to office. And so that's nearly ten years have seen. Somewhat of its entire lifecycle pretty much in the last ten years, the bankruptcy, the assumption of the lease by garrison and some steps before that. But this is a big deal for us and I know it. Mr. Conway doesn't make presentations with as much fanfare as certainly I know is involved with the moment that we are embarking upon. But it is a big deal. This is the best thing that I have seen for the Queen Mary in the entire time that we have discussed this for a decade to bring her back to her glory. She is nearly back and I have to thank Garrison for that. They've done a good job of stepping into the management role of Queen Mary and surrounding properties, even though it was not their original role or their original mission. And I think garrison for that, for stepping up and doing that. So they have brought. Back. The various parts of the ship that they have been working on and really kind of short her up. And so I'm thankful for that. They've lived up to the conditions of their lease and brought on the necessary partners to manage the hotel and restore the Queen Mary according to the Conservation Management Plan. And that's important to us. So I do think them for that. However, the Queen Mary and her surrounding property have the potential to be so much more. And given what we have done in the downtown proper to restore life and energy and vitality as well as improve the area economically, I think it's time that this type of attention is paid to the Queen Mary as well. And that's why I'm very optimistic with this new lease urban commons, we will take the next step with you and a step toward development of the acreage around the ship in a manner that enhances our downtown and our shoreline. And I think the timing couldn't be better. I'm also confident that will include our Queen Mary Land Development Task Force in the most effective manner possible. I know they had their first meeting recently, and I know they're very excited to be a part of this process. So, Mr. Mayor, I'm very supportive of this recommendation. I look forward to working with Urban Commons to deliver on the terms of their lease and the potential of this site. I also want to share that I am personally committed to the improvement of this ship. It's something that I think each of us feels to some degree, but we all have an affinity for the Queen Mary here in Long Beach, and I am very happy to see this through. Ten years in the making, from where it was ten years ago to today and where it can be. I thank you for that. And thank you, Mr. Conway. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales. I just want to thank Mike for this great presentation. I know as Vice Mayor Lowenthal mentioned, the upgrades and renovations are just astounding to see where we were at and then just the stacks alone. I mean, an incredible improvement to our beautiful landmark here. And I thank you for your work in this. I think we certainly had a long way to go. And this is timely as we are changing the downtown, as things are getting a little bit better. And yes, the surrounding does need to certainly change and we need to look beyond what we currently have. And so I want to thank you for that, for bringing that to light. Mike, I just had a question as far as additional outreach. I mean, is there going to be like a new marketing plan of some sort or how would that be? Um. Councilmember Gonzales, I think we'll start with the Queen Mary Task Force to get an idea of how we can or how urban commons can coordinate with them and the outreach efforts. So I think we'll take some guidance from the from the task force. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Richardson. I want to just take a moment to again and this is my second or third time tonight just congratulating folks on a legacy project. This is the second or third thing I've seen tonight at the council that really is fantastic work that represents, you know, not only the leadership in and our vice mayor's district, but also the great work staff has done. So I'm really excited about what's to come with Queen Mary. When I you know, I'm not from California, but when I before I lived in California, there were three things I knew about Long Beach. It was Snoop Doggy Dogg. It was the Port of Long Beach and the Queen Mary. So this is in the you know, this is this is big, right? This is this is really big. And so I want to congratulate our vice mayor in her her her hard work, the entire city council, the mayor, the task force staff . I'm really excited about what's to come. And this is going to be big for tourism in our city. Thanks. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you. I have a few questions. In regards to. The I know we have the task force in place, but what can you tell us in terms of development plans, development, desire? Given your your knowledge of the project and the partners that we're going to be working with? Councilmember Price There has been some considerable discussion as to potential uses on the site, and as the demand analyzes indicated there, it will likely be entertainment oriented. Hurst Harrigan is on the Urban Commons team. They are a preeminent consultant relative to entertainment development in the South Land and we think that's the likely direction that development will take for the land side. But we want to make sure that we don't prejudge what will come out of the task force and what will be communicated through outreach in the downtown to the Greater Long Beach area. But we expect that given the constraints of the site and the Tidelands restrictions that entertainment uses are likely going to be predominant on that land. But the actual elements we would like to get more feedback from the community and the task force on that. But you see development at that site as a. Foregone conclusion. The If I understand your question correctly, Urban Commons has been patiently waiting to start the outreach and development process. They're anxious to get started. Okay. And then I know we talked about the Dome and Carnival's use of the dome. I happened to be at a conference at the Queen Mary every day last week. So I got to spend a lot of time on the ship, as well as a lot of time talking to people whose first time it was in Long Beach , who were in the conference with me and who were on the ship for the first time. So I made a lot of kind of user observations. And what, if any, requirements do we have for the maintenance or the updating of that dome? It really does not look like it's in good shape at all. I don't think it's been cleaned in a while. The dome is under the Garrison's lease currently and there has been a request by Carnival to have the dome cleaned. Evolution Hospitality responded to that request, indicating that as soon as the event that is occurring in the dome is completed, that they would move forward and clean the dome. And are there any sort of maintenance requirements moving forward? Because, you know, it does reflect on on the city to a large extent. And to nicely. Garrison is required. Currently, Garrison through evolution is required to maintain the dome. In informal discussions with Carnival. There is an expectation that significant investment will occur in the Dome once they take it over. We can't get into detail. The city doesn't have a direct relationship with Carnival, but we expect an investment to occur shortly. All right. Well, thank you for your report. And thanks to the vice mayor for the information she's provided and the work that you've all done to educate us all tonight. Thank you. Thank you. And just to bring a little more clarity from what I understand, that as soon as chill is over, they're going to clean the dome from when, say, the the emptied out and the clean the both the outside and the inside. Vice Mayor Lowenthal. Thank you again, Mr. Mayor. I was eager to have the task force start and misspoke, actually. I only imagine that they've met. They have not met yet. They plan to meet in January, but I know they're looking forward to it. Thank you, Councilman Andrews. Yes. First of all, I'd like to thank Mr. Conway for the fine job. He's, you know, taken on with this new a vice mayor in your district. But I can see nothing but a win win for this situation. And knowing the job that you guys are going to, you know, take it from looking at the pictures that you put up here. It shows me that I can go back to the Queen Mary and get away from those ghost stories I used to hear about. So you guys keep up the good work and kudos because I will be going back with my family again. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to before we go to the vote, I'm going to make a couple a couple closing comments. There's no question that the Queen Mary is an icon of the city of Long Beach. When people think of Long Beach, they think of the Queen Mary. There's incredible history. There's incredible military history tied to that ship. There's history in the way Long Beach was developed and certainly as the way our country was developed here and in California. So when you think about the the value that that ship has, it's really you can't really put a price on the cultural icon that it really is. And so to be able to finally get to a point where we're going to look at the land surrounding the ship and develop it in a way that's appropriate, that's community oriented, that maximizes the space, but also brings more people and draws more people to the ship while reinvesting back into the ship and into and into the dome, I think is is critical. I think it's we shouldn't vote without also thinking officially a garrison. You know, Garrison came in at a very difficult time in the Queen Mary's history. The Queen Mary has had a a rough history in the last ten, 15 years. And so the fact that Garrison stepped in when they did, made the investments that they could, reinvested it back into upgrades on the ship. Now, the ship is not in perfect shape. There is a lot of investment that still needs to happen. But you can't argue that the ship today is in much better, but in a much better position and improved from a historical landmark perspective than it was before Garrison came on board. And so thank you to Garrison for those investments. And we know that now, as this transitions over to urban commons, which I've had obviously a chance to know, the vice mayor has had a chance to to meet with them. We're bringing in a group that has experience with development, and Garrison never intended to be the master developer on the site. And what we really have an opportunity now to do is to build out a part of downtown Long Beach that has been dormant, in many cases empty and with and has not met its potential. So this is an opportunity to build something spectacular adjacent to the Queen Mary. It's a chance to build something that respects the fact that the Queen Mary is the centerpiece and will be the centerpiece of this development. And we look forward to in in the coming months when the community process kicks off in January with the first meeting of the task force. We're going to engage in a very, I think, a very open and transparent process where the community can come in and be able to comment on on on the plans that Garrison and the task force are going to develop in the in the coming months. And so we we're excited to, in the future, break ground on that project and build something the whole community can be proud of. And that, of course, respects the great beauty of the ship. And so thank you, Garrison. And. And if all goes well here. Hello. Urban comments. And we'll begin that relationship. And with that. Members, please cast your votes. Motion carries. Thank you and thanks again for for that next item, please.

The presentation appears to be a City Council meeting discussing agenda items related to land use and zoning. The specific item covered was Council Bill 119664 concerning rezoning a property located at 5256 Rainier Avenue South from Neighborhood Commercial 2 (NC2) to Neighborhood Commercial 3 (NC3), as well as approving a property use and development agreement as a condition of the rezoning.

The key points were:

1) Council Bill 119664 amended the official land use map to rezone the property at 5256 Rainier Ave S from NC2 to NC3.

2) Approval of the rezoning was contingent on accepting a property use and development agreement.

3) There was a proposed amendment to substitute a new executed version of Exhibit B, which contained the property use and development agreement document.

4) The amendment substituting the executed Exhibit B was moved, seconded, and approved by vote.

5) With the amendment, the Council then voted to pass the amended Council Bill 119664 rezoning the property and approving the development agreement.

The presentation followed standard procedural flows for considering amendments and voting on legislative items in a City Council meeting setting. No substantive reasoning or background was provided regarding the specific rezoning case or development agreement details.",0.6619047619047619,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, key points, and underlying context first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Now, one councilmember has to leave a little bit early tonight. There's been a request to move one of the items up. So we'll be carrying item number 13 and then going into public comment. Item 13 Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilwoman Mongo, Councilman Andrew's recommendation to request city manager to evaluate new and ongoing revenue sources and make the necessary preparations to restore Paramedic Rescue 12 in January 2017. Further request City Manager to evaluate and report back to the City Council the feasibility of a short term and long term plan for additional public safety restorations within 90 days. Thank you. So as this is my item and I made the motion, I'll go ahead and speak first. Mayor Garcia had to step out. So first, I want to thank my COSIGNERS for signing on Councilwoman Gonzalez, Mongeau and Andrews, as well as all the council members who have expressed an interest over the years in placing a greater focus on public safety. I also want to thank the residents and the leaders who are out here tonight for coming out this evening and joining us the week of Thanksgiving. This is important and I'm great. I'm glad to see this turnout. Our public safety personnel serves more than more than 500,000 people. 5 million, 5 million visitors a year protects 55 square miles of our city, the busiest, busiest port in the West Coast and the airport. In fact, the fire department, emergency responders, some of the busiest per capita in California. Rescue 12 was eliminated in FBI 2011 budget during do due to the great great recession. That's almost seven years ago. And since since it's being eliminated, calls for service have increased by 16 and a half percent, according the fire department's presentation to the city. The increase in call volumes with elimination of resources has created the worst response times in our department's history. We are we are currently only meeting national average response times 44% of the time. Beginning in 2010, the Long Beach Fire Department had to continually restructure its its deployment strategy due to budget cuts. And since then, the number of calls have continued to grow. Response times have increased. Safety of our residents is being compromised. For example, the average of all emergency response times in 2005 was 5 minutes and 29 seconds, with 72.8% of calls. Meeting Response Standards. Ten years later, in 2015, the average of all emergency response times was 6 minutes and 16 seconds, with only 46.1% of the calls meeting standards. And that's just unacceptable. So for too long, we've been forced to cut rather than invest. And even as the local economy has improved, we were unable to bring back critical services that we need to maintain a vibrant world class city. This year, local leaders asked residents to step up and make investments in our city and county through adopting a number of new revenue sources. And because they all passed, our general fund will see benefits from new revenue opportunities. And now's the time to invest in quality public services that our residents need and deserve. We've already started to bring back some of those services we've lost due to the Great Recession, and past budget cuts will soon see those police departments south division restored with new police officers. We're seeing we've seen the fire department's Belmont Shore Station restored with Engine eight. These investments are all important because they help us work toward a safe and long, safer Long Beach. The way to improve response times, to add resources and people to respond to 911 calls for service. Remember, Rescue 12 is a benefit to the entire city, not just north Long Beach. Restoring Rescue 12 will help reduce response times throughout the city by helping other rescues in their respective areas, rather than have to wait for units to become available from across town. But now's the time to do even more. We need to push for a full restoration of public safety services and new strategy, direct to direct services to the areas of greatest need. It's time to restore Paramedic Rescue 12 by adding a ninth paramedic in the system. We can be better assured that when there's an emergency, help will be on its way faster. Additionally, evaluating the responsibility of the feasibility of long a short term plan for further restorations will ensure a path to a safer Long Beach. The public's trust is in us, and I'm committed to doing all I can to work toward a safer, more equitable city. And so I strongly encourage my colleagues to approve this motion, which does two things. It calls on the city manager to specifically take steps to to reduce, restore rescue 12 at the beginning of the year, based on the prior list set forth by our fire chief. And it allows us to further explore of public safety restorations with our police department to establish some sort of a plan to implement them. We, we, we when we want to see some balance here, we know that needs are not just in the fire department, but also in the police department. So as we, you know, further implement the fire chiefs priority list, we want to talk with and engage with our police chief about his priority list and see additional additional restorations on the PD side as well in the fleet in the future. I want to I want to recognize that Restoring Rescue 12 also puts us on a path to further restorations in the fire department. There is if we stick to the fire chiefs restoration once 12 is out of the way, you have a path to engine 17, which I know is very important to Councilmember Darrell Super now and some of the folks in central and east Long Beach but tonight is about 12 and our paramedic services that that have not yet been restored. So my question for city staff. Mr. City Manager, how would you respond to this request tonight? Mayor. Council members will be coming back with a report that provides the financial information to the city council can make decisions to begin those restorations, whether it's fire restorations and or police restoration. So we'll have a financial plan that the city council will then make decisions on how it's going to be funded and what it's going to cost. Thank you. And so that concludes my remarks. And that's my motion. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez. Yes, I think in light of many of the funding sources that we will see come down to us as we receive more information on what those projections will look like, I am supportive of this item because that was the rescue. 12 was the next immediate item on the priority list. And I think it is only fair that we respond to that and make sure that we're not only responding to rescue 12, but I assume, like Councilmember Rex Richardson said, that we will have an overall discussion on public safety and what those priorities will look like with both police and fire and even with our Marine and harbor area as well. I think that's very important. And so I wholeheartedly support this item. I think what we've done in South Division and in eight in Belmont Shore has been incredible. I look forward to seeing more and thank you both for being here as well. Thank you, Councilmember Superman. Thank you. I would like to ask for a friendly amendment. And that would be to add engine 17 to the language here. So Rescue 12 and Engine 17 are considered simultaneously. I've spoken at council on a couple of occasions expressing the need for Engine 17, how critical it is. So I'll take a little different approach tonight. If we look at the project management, management model of cost schedule quality. I think the cost has been well established that it's 2.2 million to restore Engine 17. Measure A gives this $48 million a year. So you think if you divide that in third place, fire and public works, that's 16 million. So that's 2.2 million out of that 16 million for for fire. So if we add up, let's say all of the if we take that restoration of engine eight, the second fire academy at 1.3, four, 4 million. Rescue 12 and Engine 17, I get a grand total that is only 43 and a half percent of that 16 million. I believe that is feasible cost wise if we go to schedule. I believe Chief Tory told us the last time he spoke here that he can restore this engine company immediately and schedule. When you talk about fire is it's unique in a couple of ways. It's one of the few resources that can be restored immediately. And secondly, you never know when that need is going to be. We're entering the winter season and just ironically, I believe, the duplex that burnt down across the street from Station 17 that took place in January. If we want to talk about the third item and that is quality, I've spoken of that before here and that is I think I talked about how the calling areas, the areas of the city, 17 calls on a but several other engine companies and I think it affects five different council districts. So I'll just talk about 17 specifically. They cover the four or five freeway from Lakewood Boulevard to approximately Bellflower Boulevard, and that works in tandem with Engine 22. So if there's a fire or crash on the freeway, Engine 17 would approach from Lakewood Boulevard heading south, and 22 Wood would head north from Palo Verde. And the reason that's critical to have these two engine companies work in tandem is when you get a report of a crash on the freeway, sometimes they don't know what side of the freeway it's on. And so they can kind of approach from both directions. Also, if you think of I haven't talked before about the number of structures in Engine 17 area, some actually multiple, multiple story buildings. The Holiday Inn at Lakewood and Willow comes to mind. Community Hospital near the traffic circle is in Seventeen's area. I talked about council districts five and three. I think Park Estates probably has the largest number of wood shingle roofs per capita than any other neighborhood in the city. So for those reasons, I'm asking my colleagues to support a friendly amendment or extra Vice Mayor Richardson and approve us moving forward with Rescue 12 and Engine 17. Thank you. Thank you. And I'll I'll I'll certainly take it in advisement. Here's what I would here's what I would say I admire and I know how important that engine is. And so we just restored an engine in East Long Beach, engine eight. The paramedics, we haven't yet. The fire chief is, you know, run data back in the day. And then we asked them to rerun the data a year ago after the elimination R&D about his priorities. And they came back the exact same priority list as they were back in 2011. So it came back that the priority list was Rescue 12, then Engine 17, and then I believe it was 1 to 1 and they can speak to that. But tonight is really not about like we didn't dogpile engine eight and say we need everything else at that time. We supported it everything in the order. And I'm I'm willing to add to my motion to ask staff to evaluate the feasibility of of of engine 17 or provide some sort of a timeline for 17. But this motion and I don't want to diminish that this is really about paramedic services and communities waited seven years so that that would be my response and I hope I hope that a suture request. Councilwoman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and thank you to my colleagues who brought this item. This is definitely a priority and one that I support wholeheartedly. And I know that we as a council, all of us want to see police and fire services restored, and we've been working on this for some time. So I really appreciate Councilman Richardson bringing this forward. I'm also very supportive of Councilman super nice, friendly and would hope that you would consider bringing accepting it. I can't speak for him, but it sounds to me like he's basically trying to say, can we can we find a path for both, is what I think he's trying to say rather than one over the other. But we actually have an item on the public safety agenda that was filed in, I believe it was in October. Our meeting got canceled because of one of the members not being able to be there. But we do have an item that's on file and it is asking it's similar. It's asking for the city staff to take a look at measure a revenue sources and look at our public safety priorities so that we as a council can talk about whether or not we want to reallocate the priorities that we have set under Measure A and this is a discussion that we had at the budget cycle, and I believe it's very consistent with the logic that Councilman Supernova just articulated a few minutes ago, and that is we have $48 million that we can reasonably anticipate receiving as a revenue source related to Measure A, and perhaps we need to reevaluate still within the guidelines of public safety and infrastructure where we're going to be allocating that money. We are facing some challenges in the city, as Councilman Rich or Vice Mayor Richardson has mentioned, that are new and different. And every day we are challenged with more public safety challenges that our police and fire departments are not equipped to handle in the manner that they should. We're not meeting the standards, and and that's certainly something that we want to improve upon. So I support this this motion completely, especially with the friendly. I do expect that will provide a report to the full council after we have our public safety meeting. And we're already planning on preparing a written report for my council colleagues so that we can hopefully have a broader discussion as a as a body in terms of measure a money and how we may want to allocate that money within the different public safety and or infrastructure categories. So thank you again for bringing this. And the more resources that we can allocate to public safety, I think the better off we'll be as a city. So thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. Thank you. I'm a big supporter of ensuring that our neighbors have the most safe and most safe environment. I appreciate that. Councilmember Richardson and I worked strongly on this back before the budget, and there does have to be a path one at a time. I think we are all on board. That 17 is next. And I hope that within the context of the report, at least we could get a timeline on what that might look like. If that's a possibility, I think that that's a strong indicator to the community that will help us make those decisions for the next rounds of measure funding that we have coming down the pipe. So with that, I appreciate and we'll support the motion. Thank you. Councilmember Everingham. Thank you, Mayor. I to support this motion. I think that we have a plan. When we passed Measure eight, we said that we're going to be looking at all of our public safety deployments and where we need and and restoration while the other stations and the units that we were missing or had taken away because of our culture and the economy. So I'm very supportive of this measure. And I think that if we are to be successful and we are to be within our budget, we need to stick to the plan that we set it initially and let's stick to it. So I will be supporting the original motion. Thank you, Councilmember Supernova. You know, I talked about stats and whatnot just a minute ago, and I'd like to go to the intangibles. I think by definition, that's not quantifiable. That's usually not the area I quote. But I'd just like to make one other point about Station 17 and the lack of an engine company in that house. To say that it's next to the training center is kind of an understatement. It's it's on the same prop property, basically. And this is what all of our recruits see as a working station in our city. And you think of that recruit class that we're paying, you're spending $110 million on. If there are 20 recruits there, that's $67,000 per recruit. I would like those recruits to be really enthused about working in the city of Long Beach to see that this city supports a fire station with a fire engine in it. I would like to see that we spend that money and they don't go to another agency after they've received the training here. And I think it's just a critical piece, as I said, morale, whatnot. Those are the intangibles. But I think this is the display. This fire station is a display for every one of our recruits to see working next to the training center. And that's just another reason why I think we need Engine 17 in place there. I if if my friendly is not going to be accepted, I'll go a different course. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to go to Councilman Pearce. I'll make a few comments and make it a public comment and we'll go back to council. Councilman Pearce. Thank you. I think it's great that we're, you know, have this item in front of us that we're looking at restoration again. I think during the budget process, we talked about having this come back in January and doing everything we could do to restore fire. I think that there are a lot of questions that I still have. So forgive me for going through a little bit of a process. So I have that the priority list is 17 one, two, one. Is that correct? I know our police chief is in here about 12, 17, 12, 17, one, two, one. And it's my understanding that those, as Daryl said, could be turned on immediately. Should we take a vote to restore all of those today? We could restore those. I'll turn that over to our deputy chiefs. We have Deputy Chief Chris Roe and Jim Rex McCool. Many are members of the council. My name is Jim Erickson, assistant chief of operations. As far as turning them on tomorrow, that would be a possibility. Yes, we can absolutely do that. Do we have the staff to if we turn them on, say, tomorrow or January 1st to staff all of those? The way we do our constant staffing, we would we would use overtime for that and until the recruit class graduated. But as far as staffing them, we would staff them. Yes, ma'am. Okay. And my concern is representing a majority of downtown, as we just supported a you know, one of the tallest buildings that we're going to have in downtown. Is that the response times that council, that vice mayor mentioned, 46% meeting standards. That's to the door. That's not to the 35th floor. That's not all the way up. And so how are we making sure that we're covering our downtown constituents and also we're leaving our firefighters and paramedics to impact the areas and get out to their folks as quickly as possible. So it's I'm supportive of restoring 12 because we said that we were going to do that and we said we were going to do that during the budget cycle. My expectation is that when we talk about that second part, which is staff coming back in 90 days about what it would mean that we're having a conversation about all the email money, all the funds that are coming in and really being able to act quickly to restore to restore as fast as possible, and that our fire would be able to do that. When it comes to restoring PD, I know that there are restorations that need to be made citywide, and particularly on the West Side and North Side, but also wanting to have that conversation be something that is rooted in an equity lens, that it's not just about more PD on the ground, but it's about supporting things like data and some of the projects that they're doing in New York. And how are we policing in a way that's consistent with our values as a city? So if we bring that back, I just don't want it to be a report about what does restoration look like? That was there before, but I would want to have a fuller discussion about it. So I don't know. Vice Mayor, if you have any comments on that, I just. Okay. Vice Mayor Richardson. Sure. I just want to be able to respond more directly to Councilmember Supernormal. So so I don't think I was maybe I wasn't clear before. I didn't think that it was necessary to do an accept or a rejection of the motion. I express support that. I think the motion says go ahead and, you know, explore, evaluate further restorations. I'm not saying we depart from the Chiefs priority list. That priority list calls for Engine 17 directly after Rescue 12. So I'm committed to that fully. And I have no problems or reservations with asking staff, Hey, if they find the ability to do more than rescue 12, great. I'm not saying limited. Well, I'm going to wait till councilmember spinoff is. So what? I just want to be clear. I'm not saying if staff comes back and says we can restore engine 817 101. Go for it, by all means. But the fire chiefs priority list for going on seven years, which is where you spent about a year ago, has come back and said the priority list is the priority list. And that has not changed. And I support that completely. But I think thank all the council members for their comments tonight. I'm going to make a couple comments, make a public comment, and then I'll go back to the to the actually, if the other two councilmembers want to jump back in. I think that's fine as well, obviously. Just just a couple of things. I think first is I do want to just start off by thanking, obviously, Vice Mayor Richardson, that you've been advocating for this for a very long time. And so I appreciate that in the community we've seen out here multiple times on this very issue. So thank you. A couple of things I think are important. Just in just to note, it is always been certainly my intention and I think the council's intention to be able to make more restorations on public safety side beyond the first two that were made in the first year. The budget that was passed part of of Measure A was obviously focused on a large public works program, which is beginning, which we're very excited about, but also making public safety restorations. And we've made the first two. We're very excited about those two. In addition to that, I think having this discussion around 12 is the next part of the restoration, as is the discussion that Councilman Supernova's bringing up when it comes to 17 as well as other public safety needs. So what I also am hoping for is a couple of things, I think. One, I think it's I think it's very appropriate. It's clear from the chief that rescue 12 is the next the next priority of a restoration. But it's also clear that 17 is the next priority of the chief after after that rescue. And so it is obviously important for us to begin that process of looking at 12, but also right following up behind 12 is 17. And so staff should also begin that preparation of looking at those numbers and seeing what the cost is and and how would it be able to do that or not do that? But I think we need to have that discussion. And so I am supportive of the process to begin looking at 17, I think, Councilman Shoop, when I think that's appropriate. But I also obviously I know that 12 is the next priority and I think that's got to be dealt with first. In addition to that, I think we need to here in these, you know, then when staff comes back, I think that is going to be an appropriate time to have a council discussion about what are the next priorities of both the fire department and the police department long term? What does all the revenue that's coming in mean for the city? And also what does the revenue mean when it comes to Measure eight? I just want to remind everyone, measure is not a permanent tax. So any restoration that is not public public infrastructure, we have to figure out how to pay long term because what we are not going to do and what I will not support is making a bunch of restorations and then cutting those and cutting all of those apparatus across the city. So I think the the approach that the council is taking is very smart, which is easing into the restorations while the economy is growing, while incredible projects are being developed and built across the city. So that from a fiscal point of view, we're being both we're both listening to the community and doing the right thing, which is making restorations. And by the way, once we restore Rescue 12, we're going to continue to restore more public safety, hopefully restorations. And I think that's a conversation this council supports and wants to have. But I just also caution is that we have to be able to figure out and have a plan on how to pay for these long term, which and we're talking about these next five years and then the ten years. And so that is, I think, needs to be part of this, a greater, larger discussion when we have it in a couple of months or whenever you bring it back. Mr. West. I think what everyone said here has absolute merit. I think Councilwoman Price has been very clear about her interests here, and I appreciate that. And we should discuss those. We should be discussing 17, should be discussing all the needs, but also talk about what what do we really have in terms of dollars? When will those dollars disappear and at what rate is the economy moving to be able to cover some of these expenses long term? So I just wanted to make those comments. I am supportive of moving forward on 12. So that's the next restoration, but also to begin to look at 17 because that clearly should be the restoration that we that we focus on beyond beyond 12. And so I hope that's where we end the motion ends up, is that we can find some sort of compromise to do that. Let me go back to the to the council, and then I'm going to go to public comment. Councilmember Soprano. Okay. I'd just like to clarify something here. There seems to be some language that I'm somehow deviating from the chief's recommendation. I am not. I am in lockstep with what the chief has recommended. All I'm saying is that we came out with the restoration of Engine eight and a fire academy. Those are two items. So I'm saying, okay, now the chief is recommending in order rescue 12 and engine 17. Who says we have to stop it? Why not? Item we did two items before. So let's get both of these items restored tonight. That's my point. I'm not deviating from anyone's list, but I didn't hear the chief say, Oh, you can only restore these one at a time. That's my rule. That did not happen. So I'm saying let's restore both tonight. If we're going to come back with a report, the dollars are here. It's in black and white right now. I don't know what the report is going to tell us later that we don't know tonight. So I would like to move forward with this item. I would like the friendly accepted that we're going to add engine 17 to the rescue 12 restoration. Thank you. Thank you. And to clarify, Vice Mayor, I don't think you're asking for any restorations tonight, is that correct? Okay. Just want to make sure that clarify that as well. Okay. Let's go to the public and then we'll. Okay, let's go to the public. And then after we'll come back to the council. So if you have a comment, please come forward and 3 minutes, state your name. Good evening, Councilman and Mayor. My name is Eileen, and I live on Saint Francis in the ninth district. And I come before you to voice his support for Rescue 12. We have a number of seniors living alone in my neighborhood, and I know there's in other areas as well. But it's we have been without a rescue 12 or a rescue truck for quite a number a number of years now. And we have had to rely on other districts for that kind of service. And it's very important. Some of my neighbors have had to wait for quite a while before some have shown up, except maybe for the engine to show up. In fact, yesterday I was out doing some of business and as I came home was approaching the street where I turned to go home. Here had been a head on collision right at the street where I was going to have to turn. The only vehicle there to support the accident was a police car. No paramedics. Nobody else was there. And as I came around the corner and it was the car was sitting right there, it was obvious that somebody had hit the windshield. And I would have liked to have had somebody there to to help. And so. It wasn't until I got home, which is several blocks away, that I finally heard the fire department start to come. Because we have we live I live close to a hospital. So I hear those kind of sirens a lot. So I recognized what it was. So I want to encourage you to support this consideration and for listening to me. And thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilmember Gonzalez and Mungo and Andrews for going along with him. Thank you. Thank you, Counsel. I'm sorry. I'm actually next for the speaker. I apologize for that. Yes, sir. Good evening, Mayor and council members. I'm getting over a call right now, so if I sound kind of funny, it's because of that. I'm in favor of the I'm Phillips. I'm here and I've been a resident of Nord Long Beach for about 50 years and I'm also on the board of the Uptown Business District. I'm in favor of this. And North Long Beach has has a significant amount of industrial properties in their area and which is the equivalent of high rise. But I think the industrial has stands more of a chance of of injuries than than something of that wood type wood. The. 90805 zip code. Is roughly the size of Bellflower or Paramount or Lakewood. And all of these cities have rescue units that they have or they have contracted with someone to provide the service for them. When Fire Station 12 was was built, it was designed to be an emergency response center for the area. And I would assume that being an emergency response unit, that they would have a paramedic there. On a more personal note, I am personally in favor of it because both me and my neighbors have used the service in the past, and I've had a daughter that when she was having a babysitter over there, had a had convulsions . And we found out later that the paramedics came there and brought her back. Also, my wife walking the dog fell and broke her hip and she was couldn't get up. And by the time I got it and got the word and got there, the paramedics were there and helping her and they were putting her on a board and taking her to the hospital. So I appreciate the help that they provided. And I would think it's your duty to return this service to to to North Palm Beach. It's a great city. And I think North Lawn, which deserves it. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, Vice Mayor, city council members and staff. My name is Margaret Dudley and I live in the ninth district and I'm here to support the restoration. The full restoration of paramedics, rescue 12 in my district is long overdue. It's been on you guys agenda since 2010, I believe. And I fully support Chief Tory's priority and having this paramedic restored. And as my my neighbors in my community in the ninth District, we were very concerned about not having this paramedic in our district. But as you said, Supernormal, we live in the city, the whole of Long Beach, and that's going to be a priority. To have. Rescue 17 fire in 17 there. So I just urge the city manager and to go ahead when these funds come in for measure in May that you you restore you fully restore and fund rescue paramedic rescue 12. And I thank you for hearing me and I hope that you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and a safe holiday . And to my citizens, my residents of North Long Beach. Thank you all for hearing me. And please restore paramedic rescue 12. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hello. Good afternoon. Afternoon. Glad to see you again. See the honorable mayor and Vice Mayor Rex Richardson to all of the city council representatives. I'm here. My name is Linda Wilson, and I'm a resident in the ninth district in North Long Beach. And I live in the College Square Neighborhood Association area, and I've lived there for over 20 years. I do also I am also one of the community, I guess, activists or community representatives in my area. And while I empathize and feel for what Councilmember Boehner is saying about 17, I just want to remind everyone that our priority here tonight is 12. We've waited a very long time for 12. We've talked about it for years. We've agonized over it for years. We've waited and we've waited and waited for a rescue that was taken away from us. And so this is just a restore of something that was taken away. And that's what we're looking forward to. We appreciate the fact that you're preparing this fiscally sound plan, responsible plan and planning on money that you know you're going to get. And then priorities down the line, addresses additional funds that may come in. But we need stability. We need the assurances we need to bank on money and revenue that is actually planned for allocate it and that we expect mightily to present itself. And so tonight. We're really pleading with you, restore 12. Let me just share a quick story with you. If you could imagine closing your eyes for 3 minutes. Or 5 minutes would even be longer. And I say those time frames because my husband. One night did not respond to me. And I called for paramedics. And I waited and I tried to call him and tell him, don't leave me. I shook him. I tried to breathe for him. I remembered I needed to unlock the door. And so I ran to the front and unlocked the door. Then I needed and came back to him waiting. It hurt. No sirens. I prepared. I said, okay, well, I need some clothes on. So this was in the middle of the night waiting? Nothing. Nothing. It took a very long time. It took 5 minutes. That was an agonizing 5 minutes for paramedics to come. And had we had 12, it would not have taken that long. So tonight, I just want to leave that with you as you consider and as the city manager actually takes a look at the money and all of you give your considerations. 12 We need. Thank you. Go Long Beach. Go Long Beach and go uptown. That's why I love you. Next. Bigger us. Go uptown. That's right. And good evening again. My name's Greenspan, homeowner in the ninth district. And as most of you know, the ninth District is the most populated this district in the city. We don't have access to medical centers, urgent care center. So this rescue 12 would act as a go between. And it actually is a no brainer. I mean, we have new development coming. We have new interests in the north district, which is always on the short end of the stick. Some of these other areas you have Long Beach Memorial St Mary's and we can go on and on. But you know, at the Long Beach we rely on the rescue. Well, not only the service, but because the new station has actually increased our home values, which. Causes us to pay more taxes, to generate, you know, the service. So it's a no brainer to restore the service in an area that is so. Populated with. Young people under 18 years old. And again, thank you, Mayor Rex Richardson, for your due diligence and have a good night. Thank you. Last for the comment. Very good. You, Clark, is the address. I obviously support the restoration of all the fire department equipment and resources and particularly with the council. And so, again, I said that there's no reason why we can't do it all. I would, though, once again to point out. That we would not be having this discussion. Had you not? Put the city on the road to bankruptcy by the new city hall. And you had that job. You still had that opportunity, as I outlined earlier, to recapture that some of that money by replacing by building the city hall down on Ocean Boulevard. I fully support also the art and the concept which you talked about, where it's not limited to the fire department says, but restoring the integrity of the police paradigm. And particularly restoring what has been dismantled by the disease, the mindset that now prevails, i.e., destroying, dismantling the neighborhood watch program. I don't know if you're aware of this or not. But if you're one of your neighbors called. And didn't reference. It's the house that had been broken into. There were a home invasion. Was yours? And they were raping or assaulting your family members. The response out of the the disease policy from our. Dispatchers are. Well, that's not your residence. We have to have the owner call period. That is the standing de facto de jury policy of the city of Long Beach. That is disease and demented thinking. We don't need to spend dollar one to change that. We just need to fire the people that put that in place, period. Somebody. Earlier this evening pointed out a glance, another classic example of that. They had reported that a neighbor's wall had been severely damaged. Somebody had driven into it. Teetering on falling over to a public area. The response out of the disease dispatch center. You're not the owner. You have to have the owner call. You don't need to reconvene the Council of Trent to change that. But I think what we're going to have to do is change. A number of people within the police department. Hopefully we'll be able to retain Chief Luna, who's been ill served, as I said, and I'm going to address that a little later that evening. Thank you. Thank you. Kate, we're going to go ahead now and go back to the council for a vote. Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I just want to thank the speakers who came down. You made really compelling points. And it hadn't even occurred to me that we opened our new fire station in 2013, and it hasn't had a rescue once since. It's been since I've been there. We had the R&D situation, but that was a full rescue. We haven't had a rescue since that structure is open. So that's. So thank you for acknowledging that and for recognize that moment and and for all of you coming down and speaking. And I want to just I want to I want to get the city manager or the city attorney just to restate the motion for me so I can be clear, so we can be clear on what it does include. Okay. Well I'll I'll restated. It's the motion as is the motion as written. I want to accommodate I want to make sure that we do acknowledge and accommodate what Councilman Supernova is saying about, you know, making sure that if we have the ability evaluate, if we have the ability to restore 17 as well as one on one , then put us in a position to do that immediately. So not. So this isn't saying if we, you know, come back with just one plan for 12. Yes. We're not deviating from the chief's plan. But if we have the ability to do further restorations, put us in a position for the council to do so. So does that. Councilman Hooper not is that satisfy your sentiment, Councilmember Pearce? That satisfy your sentiment? Okay. So that said, I want to go ahead and call for a vote and urge my colleagues to support this. Thank you. Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Please cast your votes. Motion carries. Great. Thank you all very much. We're going to go ahead and now go on to public comment. I'm going to let let me name the first few speakers. First up, the first three, please lineup Larry Goodhue, Zo Nicholson and Steve Updike.","Recommendation to request City Manager to evaluate new and ongoing revenue sources, and make the necessary preparations to restore Paramedic Rescue 12 in January 2017, according to the Fire Chief's restoration priority list; Further request City Manager to evaluate and report back to the City Council the feasibility of a short term and long term plan for additional public safety restorations within 90 days.","Here is a focused summary conveying the core objectives, initiatives, reasoning, and relevant background from the presentation:

The central objective was to call for restoring Paramedic Rescue 12 in Long Beach starting in January 2017 and to evaluate feasibility plans for additional public safety restorations within 90 days. Key points included:

- Rescue 12 was eliminated in 2011 due to budget cuts from the recession, but call volumes have increased 16.5% since then while resources were cut. This has created the worst response times in department history, only meeting national averages 44% of the time.

- With new revenue from recently passed tax measures, the city now has an opportunity to invest in restoring critical public services like Rescue 12 that were previously cut. 

- Restoring Rescue 12 is the fire chief's top deployment priority based on data analysis, and it will help improve regional response times across Long Beach by supporting other rescue units.

- While restoring Engine 17 is the next priority after Rescue 12 per the chief's plan, this motion focused specifically on the more urgent need to first restore paramedic services which have been lacking for 7 years.

- However, the motion requests evaluating feasibility of a short and long-term plan that could potentially allow restoring both Rescue 12 and Engine 17 simultaneously if funds allow, as well as looking at police department restoration needs.

- Concerns were raised about ensuring adequate public safety coverage and response times in densely populated areas like downtown with future high-rise development. 

- There was broad council support for using new revenue to restore critical public services according to the fire chief's data-driven plan, starting with Rescue 12, while developing a fiscally sustainable long-term strategy.",0.8454545454545455,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, key points, and underlying context first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

The property in discussion is located at 400 East Willow, and it's about 679 square feet of property that was condemned or taken. It sold railroad property in 1930. The item before you was presented to the Planning Commission and had a general plan of consistency finding. On June 2nd, the City Council approved a notice of intent to vacate. On August 9th, there's been no objection from the surrounding community with that available to answer any questions that you have. Thank you, Councilman Andrews. No, I think this is fine. I like to ask my colleagues to move to approve this, please. Thank you, Councilman. You Ringa. Is there any public comment saying non, please cast your vote. Motion carries.","Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing, find that the area to be vacated is not needed for present or prospective public use, and adopt resolution ordering the vacation of the un-named alley opening adjacent to 400 East Willow Street.  (District 6)","Based on the presentation, here is a summary conveying the core objectives, proposed initiatives, reasoning, and relevant background in a structured manner:

Objective:
The primary objective was to approve the vacation (abandonment/transfer of public land for private use) of an unnamed alley adjacent to 400 East Willow Street.

Proposed Initiative: 
The Public Works Department recommended approving a resolution to vacate approximately 679 square feet of an unnamed alley next to 400 East Willow Street. This alley was previously railroad property condemned by the city in 1930.

Reasoning and Background:
- The Planning Commission found the vacation consistent with the city's general plan.
- A notice of intent to vacate was approved by the City Council on June 2nd. 
- No objections were received from the surrounding community regarding the proposed vacation.
- The area was deemed not needed for present or prospective public use by Public Works.
- The formal vacation required a public hearing, a finding that the area is unnecessary for public use, and adoption of a resolution ordering the vacation.

After the staff report by the Public Works Director and with no public comments, the City Council voted to approve the resolution vacating the unnamed alley as recommended.",0.825,"Approach each presentation by deeply internalizing the logical flow of ideas, key points, and underlying context first, without imposing premature structural constraints.

Allowing the height limitation increase for occupancy group are two of type three construction to be increased to six stories and 75 feet where all specified provisions are met. The committee recommends the bill passed as amended. Councilwoman Johnson, who. Wants to talk about construction code, this is a book. And so we we had one of the 6765 hall recommendations was to allow for us to build slightly taller buildings using wood frame construction. And the value of the wood frame construction is that buildings can then be built a little less expensive than the steel and concrete. And by a little less, I mean a lot less. And after a couple of years of charades and working with the fire department and working with a whole lot of other folks, including our Construction Codes Advisory Board, what we have in front of us today is a bill that would authorize a change the Seattle building code to allow for an extra story of wood frame construction in places where we allow for buildings that are six feet, six stories tall or larger. What this really means is that for some of our buildings that are under construction right now because of the current code, they're being built ten or 20 feet shorter than what we're currently zoned for. The zoning change would allow for that additional height, and with that additional height comes additional units. We've got a project just off the street at 10th and Jackson, that's a story below what it could be if it was built under this construction code, that extra story would bring the unit count from 320 to 375. So, you know, it sounds like a small thing, but every little project that adds another 15, 20 or in this case 50 units would make a really big difference to addressing housing affordability in the city. And with that, I urge your support very much. Any further comments? Councilmember Beck Shop, Click Win. Councilmember Johnson Thank you. I'm certainly supporting you in this work. Can you talk a little bit about compressed laminated timber CLT? Is that going to be a separate rule so we. Can go even higher using that product? Yes, that that is governed by a different section of the state code. So we need more work at the city level in order to allow for us to build taller buildings than what is proposed here with compressed laminate timber. More to come on that, but we need to do some more work with the state before we can go there. Good. No further comments. Please call the rule on the passage of the bill. Salon Bakeshop. Gonzalez Herbold. Johnson Suarez. Mosquera O'Brien. President Harrell. Hi. Nine In favor and unopposed. Feel best in show assignment. Please read the report of the Sustainability and Transportation Committee and please read the short titles items nine through 11.",AN ORDINANCE amending the 2015 Seattle Building Code as adopted by Ordinance 125161; allowing the height limitation increase for Occupancy Group R-2 of Type IIIA construction be increased to six stories and 75 feet where all specified provisions are met.,"Here is a focused summary capturing the core objectives, proposed initiatives, reasoning, and relevant context from the presentation:

The presentation covered a proposed amendment to the 2015 Seattle Building Code to allow an increase in the permissible height for wood-framed buildings of Occupancy Group R (residential) using Type III construction from 5 stories/60 feet to 6 stories/75 feet. This amendment, recommended by the Planning and Zoning Committee, aims to enable more cost-effective construction of multifamily housing projects by allowing an extra story of wood framing rather than requiring more expensive steel and concrete construction.

Key points and reasoning:

- Follows a recommendation from the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda (HALA) to facilitate slightly taller, more affordable wood-frame construction.
- Wood framing is significantly less expensive than steel/concrete, lowering construction costs.
- The change would allow some current projects to build to their full zoned height rather than being limited below by existing code.
- A cited example project at 10th and Jackson could increase from 320 to 375 units with the extra story allowance.
- Small unit increases across projects can meaningfully improve housing supply and affordability citywide.
- Compressed laminated timber (CLT) construction to go even higher would require further state code changes.

The Committee recommended passing the amendment, which Council then approved unanimously 9-0 after limited discussion confirming the scope excluded taller CLT construction for now.",0.8750000000000001,"Your role is to reason deeply about the substantive meaning and logical flow of information in each presentation first, without imposing rigid formatting constraints prematurely.

Then we'll do 17. Then the budget and the rest of the agenda. So we'll do item 16, please. I'm sick. I'm sick. This is a communication from Councilman Spooner, Chair of the Government Personnel and Election Services Committee recommendation to approve renaming the sports complex at Chick fil de Andrews Sports Complex at Citi Field District six. There's was emotion and a second. Frontman Austin. Sir. Thank you. And I want to thank, first of all, the government Oversight Personnel Committee. I'm. I'm soprano. Soprano and Cindy Allan, who sit on the committee. I want to thank the many residents who have written letters in support of an action that started at this city council. And that is a motion that was made to rename Chinook Field after the Andrews. Oh, the sports complex. I want to be very clear that this in no way is meant to undermine or undercut the the reverence and respect that we have for the true Dick family and the contributions that Mr. Chillicothe has. I want to point out that the critic name in the critic field will always be critic field as far as I'm concerned, because there is a significant investment in terms of signage that is already there. But I think it's important that we point out that. Former Council member and Vice Mayor Andrew's great commitment to the community as a young child. He played at what was Hamilton Ball and now to the field as a city council member. Oh, I want to go on to greatness in high school. Become a legend at public high school, a legend at Long Beach City College, a legend in the community, but also someone who was and has been instrumental in touching the lives of. Countless young people as a mentor, as an educator through the longest unified school district. His commitment to the city, his love for the city, his his accomplishments are far too much for me to go into right now. I'll leave that up to some in the community and my colleagues. But he is worthy of of our honor and this distinction. Our Parks Recreation Commission voted unanimously to support this naming. Dozens of letters have come in and public speakers from through the process have sent letters to my office and that of the sixth District Councilmember, Sally Sara. I want to thank Councilmember Sara for her support in this process because obviously this is this is something that will be in a sixth district in the central area, like I said, an area that a former councilmember or Vice Mayor DeAngelis represented for 13 years from 2007 to 2020 2000, 2013 years. That's that's that's another record, I believe, in terms of service on the city council. That should be noted. So that's it. I am very proud to bring forth this motion. I think of everything that this city council has been working on. Working on from the standpoint of. Equality and connecting and allowing our community members to to to have buy in. And in terms of process 2021, I think is is a great time, great year to to honor our former colleague, the Andrews. And so I'm proud to make this motion and as my council colleagues support. Throwing mango. Thank you. I'm very excited to support this renaming opportunity. I want to thank the committee for their diligent work on this important project. It was great to see Councilmember Andrews about a week ago at a local fifth District place. He's a staple of the community and it's great to still see him around and participating and I'm excited to support this in the same way that he has supported our city and our residents for more than a decade. Thank you. Councilwoman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I support this item, and I very much appreciate everything that Vice Mayor Andrews did for our community and all of us individually as his colleagues. He was always so kind and understanding and just really taught me a lot about being on council and answered any question that I had when I first started and was just has always been just a very friendly and kind human being. And I think he presents a really amazing, selfless role model for a lot of the youth in the community. And he has been a very positive influence on a lot of people in terms of sharing his own experiences and lessons learned in his life. And for that, I'm grateful for him because not everyone shares this openly and as transparently as he did, and he did so far a greater good and really made some positive changes in our city. So I'm very happy to support this item. Thank you. Thank you very much, Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Wanted to chime in. My voice is in support of this this action today. I think it's appropriate. Think it's fitting. I'm honored to have spent the time that I've spent on city council with Vice Mayor Andrews. I'm honored to cast his vote today in support of this effort. I think Councilman Vice Mayor Andrews has left an important impact in his story and his example and the fact that he loves Long Beach. And I'll tell you about the history. He'll tell you, you know, about his health, how he's helped impact history and set an example that anyone anyone born and raised or not born and raised in the city, you have something to offer and you can make a difference your entire life. And I think that's what it represents. And I think this is a very appropriate, very fitting. A great recommendation that came out of the committee. I want to thank both council members, Sorrell in Austin, for working together to make sure this this happens, Parks and Rec Commission and everyone involved. So I'm happy to cast his vote today in support of the news of the sports complex it should feel to be Andrews sports complex to feel. Thank you. Thank you, Council Supernanny. Thank you. It was quite an honor to chair the committee to bring this item forward. You know, there was on multiple occasions, I pointed out I was I was the number one sports fan of Andrew's. I think I showed his his highlight reel from the. Junior Rose. Bowl multiple times at. City council. But I'd just like to add to that, that when you consider that he was the first African-American student body president at Pauley High School in 1959, five years prior to the 64 Civil Rights Act, and he served on this council until 2020. So that's a leadership legacy within the community of over 60 years. And I'm just very, very proud to support this item. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen. I'm also very excited to support this item. I consider Councilwoman the Councilman de Andrews just a friend. I know also going to poly and being student body president one time. I mean, I think anyone that went to poly looks up to him. He's a role model and definitely a role model for me. And I also appreciated you know, we were talking earlier about the gentleman about jobs and and I know he was always pushing for jobs and and really hiring locally. And that's definitely a torch that that I'm happy to carry and just so proud of him. And I'm just so happy to support this. Thank you. The day has. Mayor also just wanted to make sure that I lent my support to this awesome item and to say congratulations to our former Vice Mayor Andrews for all the work that he did in the district and for his community. And to the naming of this and this location is definitely fitting. So very happy to support. And he will always remain in my mind as one of the best dressed council people I have always known. So. Cheers to our former vice mayor, Andres. I'll go ahead and say my comments at the end before the vote. And of course, I'm supportive as well. But I do think there's two members of the public. So why don't we allow the two members of the public to speak and then I'll close up. We have Sonic and Fay and Eric Parker. You can take my time, Mr.. If you want to. Okay. So I can say sixth district. It means a lot to be able here to support the former vice mayor, Dean Andrews. You know, when I was in the seventh grade, you know, I caught a case and, you know, and just the reality of the surroundings, of the environment that I grew up in. And my mother couldn't take off time to go to court with me. And for whatever reason, Mr. Andrews, you know, this is 24 years ago. He came in. He was my court liaison. And he helped me to get a very sizable amount of community service hours instead of the, uh, the sentence I never told him, and I don't think he remembers me. But, you know, that helped change my life. And I never forget that. And I asked him, uh, you don't even know me, man. And he said, Yeah, but I seen you in the neighborhood. And for me, it just, man had a lot to take and take care of the kids in the neighborhood, you know, to see someone of his size. So in a lot of the records that he was able to say 1248 rushing yards and Long Beach State. You know, he's still on the he's still on the records for that one. You know, I think he's the most sports accomplished council person in the last hundred years will say, I can't speak to, you know, the late 1800s, but I can say that in the 20th century, at least. And it's. Very appropriate that. Someone whose grew up in the 19th and Lewis, you know, he grew up in the neighborhood and it's just happened to skip away from city feel we in the community we very much support the civic family and and what it means to have them with respect to Hamilton Boone. And, you know, this is a, uh, um, a celebration of a pioneering athlete turned teacher turned, uh, political representative for a community that's been underrepresented for so long. And I just want to thank the city council here and everyone for supporting. And, um, yeah, I'm honored to speak in support of my hero, the former vice mayor Anthony. So thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. This town. Certainly got. Go. Oh, I got to put my back. About that, I guess you can describe. This town was very different when I came. Almost 60 years ago. There were places that. African-Americans could not go in this town. You can go to signal hill can go to some of that places these Long Beach. You council people are doing a great job because the symbolic. Effort. It's symbolic. Naming a field after a good friend of mine and a great person. But it stands to talk about how Long Beach has changed. In these years. Being an African-American, Latino, especially male. Living in this town and other cities in this country is tough. And for you to vote. Some of the ancestors who have gone and transitioned out are rejoicing now because you have voted. Someone who is African-American. In a symbolic way. And I think there are some friends of mine who's on the council vote on stance on talking about how you guys. But this town needs so much more. And this is a step in the right direction. I hope you take that seriously. You have to walk in the shoes of people who have been oppressed, and the equity things that you guys are trying to do with is monumental to try to bring some hope. To people who have been down depressed. You have an awesome responsibility. Let's not hide from it. Naming this field is a good token for that and it is very much deserving but says much, much more. Take out. From where you are. And look at the other guy. And legislation is not going to change it, but changing the hearts of people will. So supporting this is very, very good. Very honored to be honored this way. But there's so much more to do. And I know that because I know some friends on the council will do that. Thank you very much. That the new mayor council members. My name is Keith Durham. Lily. I grew up with this city. At. Seven years old. I came here from Oxnard, California. And the first thing, I lived in Navy housing and heard all the tales and stories about the great athletes we had. And then I got to meet this guy when I was 11 years old. We didn't know about college, but we knew about education. They took us to Cal State, Long Beach, put us on a bus, and we played all day. We went to the classes. We would play basketball. We swam and we were impressed. And as I got older, I played football and Pauly D rides up in a white Rolls-Royce with a white suit on and white shoes on, serve as a take tag. So the students were going like, I want to be like that guy. So we were like, He gets out, he's flamboyant, he's real cool. We say, Wow, we got to be like you. But the good thing about Eddie, he was the president of the Poly and Poly. I went to poly as the homeless and champions. So he just wasn't an athlete for be an African-American man to be the president. In 1959 at a school like Poly was run by a Virginia clergy club. You're going to be very bright as a person. You have to be on the class. You didn't get passed through like some of the athletes used to. So he had to be able to read and write, comprehend. So he's our hero. And I only had three heroes. I had it, Wilson, who was a councilman, he gave me a chance to see that somebody considered what you guys a black man, John Rambo, who's an Olympian, and the angels, those three people major me to do community work. I do now. So I represent a group called Cultural Arts in Long Beach. And about the future leaders, what we do. I teach young men to go out to be respectable, and I work with Council on Councilwoman Sue that facility. So we tried to build the camaraderie that the Angel talents to do, take kids where they haven't been before. We got to continue doing that. We missed that. You said said or high education is important athletic is second for a kid to be able to read and write comprehend like Mr. Judy and like you guys can do on this council. It represents what kids can be when they like Mayor Garcia. So we want to do the things and I feel I won championships there. I play there. We call the Hampton Ball. We call it the Dust Bowl because I'm mother. Why are you so dirty? We play at the Dust Bowl where you play. So we you know, we had a lot of the thing. So the church feel the angel feel together is a great accomplishment for a black man in that sixth district. So you guys keep doing a great job and thank you for honoring this. And you have a good day. Thank you, sir. I've actually got to give some additional comments before I close. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. They also want to thank those who took time out today to come and speak on public comment. I also want to thank the dozens of people who've written letters and emails and contacted my office and the sixth District office in support of this particular item. I think Mr. Lilley summed it up very, very well. This is an iconic figure. Who are we, who we are celebrating and recognizing home with this vote? And, you know, some of the people who have written and many of the people who have written in support of this item are our truly respected leaders throughout our community who've been impacted by Mr. Andrews and all of the impact work that he and commitment that he has had to the city of Long Beach for well over five or six decades. So with that is my comments. And again, I'm honored to bring this item forward and work with my colleagues to. Honor of our former colleague. If you're going to close. Close us up. I first want to just thank everyone for all the really great comments about Vice, me or Andrews or, you know, of course, Audie, as we as we all know him and and column and I particularly want to thank the members of the public that spoke. We've heard a lot of those stories before. But I think that the historic nature of the work that Vice Mayor Andrews has been involved with and especially his work at a time when he was a younger man, that was a much more difficult place for him. He's made a lasting impact on our community, and I'm just grateful to the entire council for working on this naming. It's very fitting and it's very, I think, very important a way to recognize someone's life contributions. And for those that haven't seen Vice Mayor Andrews in a while, he's doing very well. And he's still here and he's still going almost daily to his favorite McDonald's here in Long Beach. And, you know, he when when I hear things about him, is he every single day he goes out, buys a press telegram from the same delivery person every day, and then he walks into his favorite McDonald's in the morning and has breakfast there. So he's a real, real, real community guy. And with that, let's go ahead and vote on this item. Richard Kay. Thank you. So just as a reminder, we have one item and then after this one item, it's a presentation, an important presentation. Then we move on to the budget hearing. So we're going to hear an update on the Everyone at Home Long Beach plan and then we'll move on to the budget.",Recommendation to approve renaming the Sports Complex at Chittick Field “Dee Andrews Sports Complex at Chittick Field”.

And then I believe we have item number 30. 31. 31. All right. 31. Communication from Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilmember Urunga, Vice Mayor Richardson, recommendation to request a resolution in support of Long Beach, joining cities across the country and proclaiming March 21st, 2017 cities. Immigration Day of action. Councilwoman Pierce. Thank you. I'm excited about the opportunity to stand in unity with the cities across California and across the country, to declare this day, a day, one day of immigration, day of action. Our community is enriched by the diversity of our residents. And I think, if anything, our council agenda tonight really demonstrates that having our Cambodian community, Persian community, as well as many Latinos in the community coming together to contribute to make our city a better place. We want to make sure that we recognize that the valuable immigrant contributions to our community as city leaders. We know that declaring a day, immigration day of action is not a final step, but an important one towards protecting our diverse communities. I'd like to take the opportunity to highlight the incredible work and actions of our community based organizations that are already doing hard work to advocate for immigrant rights and support our immigrant communities during these uncertain times. Tonight, many of these advocates are not here because they are, in fact, participating in a day of action where they are learning and growing together and making plans and stepping forward to ensure that Long Beach particularly continues to protect our immigrant communities. We've already taken action as a city to support Kevin de Leon's California Values Act, which will restrict us from using local resources to do the job of the federal government. Tonight, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this item and stand in solidarity with Long Beach's immigrant communities. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Gringo. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I want to thank Jeanine for Councilmember Pearce excuse me, respect for presenting this item here. This is March 30th. This is a Cesar Chavez birthday. And there's going to be a number of activities taking place over the next couple of days, next week in recognition of a day of service. So this is one way of being able to provide that. I want to thank the Council of Mayors for also agreeing in the cities that that have agreed to participate in this as well. Obviously, today was was one of those days where we recognized our diversity. And I mentioned that during my moment of reflection. That is also a moment of silence, because I think that if anything, we we we live in the greatest country in the world, and we have to celebrate that every day. So I want to thank you for bringing this forward. Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item? Saying Num members, please cast your vote.","Recommendation to request a resolution in support of Long Beach joining cities across the country in proclaiming March 21, 2017 Cities Immigration Day of Action.","After contemplating the presentation transcript without initial formatting constraints, I've grasped the core context and objectives. Here is a structured summary conveying the key information concisely:

The city council motion aims to proclaim March 21st, 2017 as an Immigration Day of Action in Long Beach, joining other cities across the country. The rationale is to celebrate the valuable contributions of Long Beach's diverse immigrant communities that enrich the city. 

Council members Pierce and Urunga sponsored the recommendation, emphasizing Long Beach's diversity exemplified by groups like the Cambodian, Persian, and Latino communities participating actively. Declaring an Immigration Day represents an important symbolic step towards protecting these communities during uncertain times.

The council lauded the ongoing efforts of local community organizations advocating for immigrant rights and supporting immigrant residents. Passing this resolution allows Long Beach to stand in solidarity with its immigrant populations.

Complementing this symbolic action, Long Beach has already taken substantive measures like supporting the California Values Act to restrict using local resources for federal immigration enforcement duties.

The Immigration Day of Action also overlapped with activities commemorating Cesar Chavez's birthday and a national day of service that week, providing an opportune alignment.

Overall, this proclamation aims to formally recognize and safeguard the integral role that immigrants play in enriching Long Beach's social fabric and community vibrancy.",0.8523809523809525,"Your role is to reason deeply about the substantive meaning and logical flow of information in each presentation first, without imposing rigid formatting constraints prematurely.

So we're going to go ahead and go right into the study session. Okay. Thank you. So we're going to go ahead and start our our study session. And I'm going to make a few comments just to open us up before we go ahead and turn this over to our city staff to begin the presentation . And for those who are here, the way this will work is like all special study sessions of the council, like the one we've have today. Our staff is going to begin by making a presentation. I know today's presentation is fairly lengthy and so we're going to go and get through that presentation because it's important information that we get through and that the council here, then after the presentation, the Council will have the ability to make to ask questions, make comments, and then after that we will have public comment on only issues related to the study session. So the public comment on issues around homelessness and that topic. And then after that, we will conclude the study session and then begin the meeting of the City Council. Okay. Thank you. And so let me just begin by just saying, if you if you just general comments, I think there's no question that this the issue of homelessness is an issue that a lot of people have been talking about, not just here in Long Beach, but across the state and across the country. And it's been a part of our conversation for for a long time. We all know that right now the state of California and particularly urban cities like San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, Fresno , Los Angeles, you name the city, and they are all experiencing challenges as well as opportunities to do work around this issue of homelessness. We know that there is a growing and transient homeless population across the county and across the region. That's been noted, I think, across all of our media. I think we also see it when you talk to folks in our social service agencies. And so that's part of the conversation tonight. In addition, I want to know what you're going to hear tonight, that Long Beach has also been a leader in many areas of building supportive housing for the homeless, particularly around veterans, and particularly about working with a lot of our local agencies in trying to access mental health care and mental health services for many of our homeless. But we do know that there are changes, the population moves, there are certain neighborhoods that more than others, I think, feel the impact and are beginning to react to that impact and inform the council and the city of that challenge for them. And so hopefully tonight is an inclusive conversation that can engage the community. I want to say that tonight is not somehow the only night that we're going to discuss this issue. It's a study session for the council. But there have been already numerous conversations that council members have hosted in their own communities. These conversations happen all the time at our agencies, and I know that our Homeless Service Advisory Commission, which I know the members are here tonight as well, they have this conversation consistently about putting together a plan for the future. I'll also say that while we know that the last homeless count that that was completed back in January 2015 showed a decrease in homelessness. The next count, as we know, is this January at the beginning of the year. And so that will give us some clear data. And a lot of the folks that are here will be involved in that count as to where the city actually is when it comes to this this issue. The Council in the past has adopted a community strategy around homelessness, particularly back in 2010, before most of us were in office on this council. And you also may remember that there was years ago, a little over ten years ago now, I believe the city began an effort called the ten year plan to Eliminate or reduce homelessness. This was an effort that began in the city that was not just done in Long Beach, but was actually a national initiative, which I know we'll hear some about tonight. And so I think the reason why tonight's important and what I'm hoping that we discuss is not just what has been successful, but what has not been successful. What have we done where the city has fallen short? What can we do better? I'd love to hear from you. What you think we can do better? And then also looking, moving forward for innovative solutions. What are some of the best ideas that are happening across the country and across the world to address this issue? I also am very thankful to the Homeless Services Advisory Commission and all the community advocates and leaders on this issue that I've been working on this week after week for a very long time, because it's a it's a very important issue, and it's important also for the entire city to be involved. This conversation, not just the advocates and the providers, but also our neighborhood groups, our business community, and certainly the leadership of the city of the city council. Before we we I passed this on also just wanted to just conclude just by saying that as we have this discussion tonight, I know that that this is many folks view this as a challenge. And it is it's a it's a it's a challenge that we have to face as a community. But I remind us that every single homeless person has a name. All of them, at one point in their life had dreams about what would happen in their future. They all have parents. They all want to have a better life. And they're all individual people. And so I know it's a lot of us, myself included, we oftentimes talk about the homeless as a as a population. This is a population that is diverse. It's a population that has also has families and youth and and all sorts of people and veterans as a part of it. And so it's I think it's really important that we remember that we are talking about human beings and that this is a community discussion that at its core should be about helping people in our community . And so with that, I want to thank you for being here tonight. And I want to turn this over to our city staff. Mr. WEST. Mr. Mayor, council members, thank you very much for. Initiating this study session on homelessness. As a city manager, I would like to. Echo the comments that the mayor made. Truly, the issue of homelessness is one of the most significant issues facing all large cities across America. We in the city of Long Beach are blessed to be one of the only to be one of only three cities in the state of California. That have their own health departments. Most cities in California are served by the county. We're especially blessed to have a division devoted strictly to homelessness. And this is a division in our health department that works very, very closely with our Parks Recreation Department, our public works team, our police department, and our fire departments. We also are especially blessed to have our own Homeless Services Advisory Commission. That gives us a lot of policy direction that will move forward. So I'm going to introduce the people leading us tonight is going to be our director of Human Services, Kelly Collopy. Along with Theresa Chandler, our homeless services coordinator. So I'm going to turn this over to Kelly for the presentation. Kelly. Thank you. Good evening, honorable mayor. Council members and our many community members here to participate in this homeless study session. Theresa Chandler, our homeless services officer who many of you met before, and I will kick off with this presentation. First, I'd like to acknowledge that there is frustration among almost everyone regarding homeless concerns in Long Beach. Some feel the city is not doing enough. They see people on the streets with their belongings and they sometimes feel unsafe. Some are trying to help, but they don't know how. Some are providing resources directly to homeless individuals and are being asked not to. We hear that some are taking on their solution solutions of their own. And some of these solutions are neither kind nor are they effective. We are in a fragile time and the need to make sure we act from humanity. Our hope through this presentation and ensuing conversations tonight is that you all understand what is currently underway in the city. The resources provided with the city can and cannot do regarding persons experiencing homelessness. What you can do and our future planning efforts. Teresa will start with providing an overview of what the city and its partners are doing to outreach, respond to and how individuals and families. We asked the Long Beach community what we can do to address homelessness. And they answered. Thinking outside of the box. Working together. Educating and motivating the community as a whole. We must care for each other. Address. Mental health and substance abuse. Provide affordable housing. And I'll be a part of the solution. In order to embrace all of these suggestions, we need to know who the homeless are in our community. People who are experiencing homelessness are individuals, families with children, persons with disabilities, veterans, domestic violence survivors, unaccompanied youth, seniors. They are grandparents. They are parents. They are brothers. They are sisters, their sons and their daughters. Every person has a unique set of circumstances and a life story which makes the topic of homelessness a complicated one at best. The city of Long Beach has a robust system of care to address the needs of this diverse population. As you can see from this graphic, our continuum of care has many partners bringing together the core services needed by our population experiencing homelessness. The city's Department of Health and Human Services is the backbone to these efforts in Long Beach. Applying each year to the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, also known as HUD, to resource these services. The Long Beach Continuum of Care is an integrated and coordinated system that provides various services, including street outreach, intake and assessment, emergency shelter, transitional housing, permanent housing and supportive services. I will go further into the definition of these later in the presentation, but each household has a unique set of needs and the system is designed to identify the appropriate services for each household. This collaborative group of service providers has the ability to meet those needs, in part to being designated a unified funding agency by HUD in 2014. Given only to the highest quality continuum, continuum of care in the country. Long Beach is one of four U.S. phase out of 400 continuum nationwide. This status allows the flexibility to address the unique needs of our community. We do this by using best practice models that our client centered increase access to housing and demonstrate positive, measurable impacts. This Ufa status also allows us to seamlessly coordinate services. We use data to evaluate how well we are accomplishing our objectives and goals, which in turn allows us to better understand who we are serving. Furthermore, we are able to develop policy and procedures that inform decision making based on real time data. The Multi-Service Center, located at 1301 West 12th Street, is an innovative best practice model and has been copied by other communities. The Multi-Service Center serves as the one stop shop for homeless services citywide. Over a dozen of our partner agencies operate at the Mercy, working together to holistically address the needs of those accessing the center. Thanks to $2 million in support from Los Angeles County Supervisor Donna Navy, the MSI was completely remodeled two years ago and is a beautiful, welcoming location for people to receive services. We also thank the port for their ongoing support and we encourage others to come out and visit the center. The MSI provides a range of services from basic needs such as meals, meal, transportation, shower facilities to assessments of overall needs, to understanding the current living situation of each person that walks in the door and getting getting them on a housing plan that ultimately leads to a long term housing solution. Now I'd like to take a moment to review this list of active and engaged community partners who are part of this system of care. I would like to ask our partners who are present today to please raise their hands. I also want to acknowledge our continued care board members and our our Homeless Services Advisory Commission so all of you can raise your hands. And I can't continue with the presentation without without saying thank you and giving you a warm hand. We would not be where we are today without those that advocated for our division in our department historically and and today as we go forward. So thank you for your service and dedication. A key partner in our success in providing permanent housing is the Housing Authority, which also falls under the umbrella of the Health and Human Services Department. The housing authorities impact on homelessness is in, which is substantial. They set aside 701 vast vouchers for veterans, which is like Section eight for veterans, 98 housing choice vouchers, also Section eight, specifically for people experiencing homelessness and provide rental assistance for 201 people who need a combination of housing and services to live independently. However, the Housing Authority is faced with challenges that are out of their control. 486 people with vouchers are actively searching for an apartment and cannot find a place to live at this moment. Long Beach has a 2% vacancy rate making finding a home very competitive as it takes an average of six months to secure a unit. Another one of our many partners is a Long Beach Police Department who supports the city's outreach team in locating and engaging people. The Quality of Life Unit is a best practice model. The unit partners with a department of mental health clinician to connect people to services and housing. I'd like to take a moment to talk about Fred. Fred, who had been homeless for more than 15 years and living on the streets of Long Beach. He was very well known to our outreach and quality of life and West Division officers and had always refused any services or assistance. City staff and the police department never gave up on Fred and kept up their encouragement and visits until he decided to change his life and accept help. It took 11 long months to find a permanent home for Fred. They were filled with long applications, background checks, multiple emergency housing placements and several rejections from landlords. But Fred's determination paid off, and he signed his first lease in more than 15 years this past June. Fred will tell you that he did not make this commitment to change alone. It was when other people also made that commitment to him that his odds really improved. Fred Story is one of many successful housing placements here in Long Beach. Outreach and engagement are an essential part in building a relationship with people on the street. This can be a lengthy process and take multiple contacts. The city has currently only two full time employees to respond to more than 100 requests for outreach per month, which does not include existing efforts for identified hot spots for areas throughout the city such as riverbeds, parks, beaches and wetlands. Our outreach team works daily to connect and engage people who are living without a home. They visit under bridges, along trailheads, on street corners and alleys, in parks, along the freeways and other locations where people take shelter in Long Beach. They are reaching many of the places that that others often overlook or ignore. They work closely with our City Partners Park Rex and Marine Public Works, the police department and the fire department to bring quality services to people who are homeless. Their level of humanity and compassion for for everyone they meet is completely unmatched. Along with the increased volume of calls to the health department, other city departments are also seeing an uptick, seeing an uptick in requests, which in turn is increasing the pressure on the city wide response system. For example, the health department will initially do outreach and engagement to a hotspot or a particular encampment. The area can require multiple visits by outreach and police to to truly evaluate, evaluate what's happening with the people staying there. We often visit a site multiple times to engage. If the area needs to be cleaned of debris and unattended belongings. The city is legally required to post a notice of the cleanup for up to three days. The notice states that the area is to be cleaned and that any belongings left will be removed from the area by a specific date on the day of the cleanup. Street outreach returns to reengage any people at the site to offer transportation, emergency housing, and any linkages to services that may be requested. Once an area has been cleaned, any items identified as personal belongings are then collected and stored up to 90 days. Another notice is posted with information on how to retrieve the items from the storage. Cleanups can cost anywhere from $1000 to $50000, just depending on the size of the effort. And there are multiple large scale cleanups each year. Resources go very quickly. The city is often asked to move people or to clean up homeless encampments more quickly than the regulations allow. We adhere very tightly to the regulations because other cities. Other cities who have not have been subject to lawsuits leading to court oversight or requirement that remove local control of the situation. As we have learned from watching surrounding communities, we do not take these ordinances or rules lightly in an effort to avoid potential lawsuits. The demand on the continuum of care system is substantial. The Multi-Service Center provides services for an average of 1100 individuals and families per month in 2016 for a total of 13,829 client contacts. The Street Outreach Team receives approximately 100 requests for outreach each month, and there was a rise in the requests for coordination to address homeless homelessness among city departments, county departments, nonprofit partners and faith based agencies. The budget for the city's homeless services is approximately $10.9 million this year. These funds come from a number of different sources. HUD is the primary funding source at $7.5 million for the continuum of care grant. However, the city has been successful in leveraging other funding sources, such as the Community Development BLOCK, grant emergency Solutions, grant county and City Funds, private foundations and donations to the Mayor's Fund to support the continuum of care system. The Homeless Veterans Initiative, a grant funded by the Los Angeles County Supervisor Duncan Harvey, has been an important funding source and has been instrumental in ending veteran homelessness in our city. Initially a three year project, the grant was renewed for five years as a result of the extraordinary outcomes in the last year alone. These funds have been critical in helping 300 veterans find a permanent home. The Mayor's Fund for Homeless has also been important in providing us flexibility to achieve our results. This fund, made up of community donations, supports programs that help fill the gaps in the service system. These funds have assisted with job training and placement services, childcare for families, medical screenings and move in assistance. This year, the funds are being used for family reunification. The city appropriated one time funds of $380,000 from the general fund this year and $500,000 in funding to support rapid response across the city. The age funding to $250,000 of that will go to the fire department to implement a medically staffed rapid response vehicle. The other $250,000 will go to the police department to support response efforts with our other city partners. The use of police resources will be coordinated by the Health Department in conjunction with the $380,000 for health, parks and Recreation and public works to provide improved response to calls for assistance in the community, including more outreach and cleanup response capacity. These resources are specific to outreach response as the demand is significant. When looking at our budget overall. Please note that a majority of our funding goes to direct services for the continuum of care funding. Over 85% of the funds are for housing and supportive services. The remaining amounts support system wide administration planning and data collection. The slide shows the continuum of care program and how those resources are allocated. The bulk of our funding, $3.6 million annually goes to permanent housing options support services, which include outreach, housing, location, case management, house retention, housing retention, health care, employment training, linkage to income supports, mental health settings, abuse treatment and child care receives about $1.3 million. Transitional housing programs, which support people and families as they transition to permanent housing, receives another 1.1 million and $780,000, goes to rapid rehousing programs, which provide short term rental assistance to the newly homeless. The remaining $600,000 supports compliance and planning activities, data collection and program evaluation combined. There are a range of housing options available for people in Long Beach. We have 257 year round emergency shelter beds. People tend to stay no longer than 90 days in a short term lodging. The 337 transitional housing beds are designed to support people as they move toward permanent housing. The maximum stay is two years. Rapid rehousing provides housing and short term rental assistance that assist people to quickly access housing. This also ends at two years. The 1452 permanent housing beds provide long term housing for homeless individuals and families who have a disability. Support services are provided to help people remain in their homes. Currently in Long Beach, 93% of the permanent housing and 96% of our rapid rehousing is occupied. Our affordable housing partners in Long Beach have taken on the challenge of creating permanent housing to mean to meet the need in our community. I'm sorry, can you go back in that? Can you just repeat those numbers later and see them on that? Sure. On what the percentage was. Again, just. 93% of our permanent housing and 96% of our rapid rehousing is occupied. Thank you. So our affordable housing partners in Long Beach have taken on the challenge of creating permanent housing to meet the need in our community. One of these partners is century villages at Cabrillo, a 27 acre campus community committed to breaking the cycle of homelessness. There are 20 service providers located on site 572 affordable homes, over 1000 residents on any given night, and over 2000 people served per year. The Housing Authority has been instrumental in partnering with developers to create affordable housing with a preference for previously homeless households. Examples include Long Beach and 21st Street with 40 units and the Palace Hotel 13 units. There are also some that are that are in the development stage, including anchor place that will have 120 units at the Villages at Cabrillo. And this is currently under construction. And and the Beacon, which is another 106 units, which is scheduled to begin in early 2017. Homeless impacts go beyond the city boundaries, making regional coordination critical to addressing the issue. These regional partnerships assist us in accessing resources in Long Beach, as well as to connect people who are not from Long Beach to resources in their community. This means that no one is getting turned away if they are seeking services, but they are connected to the appropriate resources across the region. These partnerships allow us to build a more effective system throughout southern Los Angeles County. In addition, L.A. County has developed 52 comprehensive initiatives to actively address homelessness. They are working to address how these can be resourced, and Long Beach City staff and partners are active participants in the conversations. Other successful regional partners include the Council of Governments through its Gateway Cities Cities Initiative. The Coordinated Entry System and the Homeless Family Solution System. The Gateway Cities Initiative is divided into four planning areas across the region. Through this effort, staff connect homeless households to appropriate regional county resources and housing in Lakewood, Signal, Hill, Hawaiian Gardens and Avalon. Long Beach is helping increase the capacity of those cities to help them address the needs of their homeless population. The Coordinated Entry System and the Homeless Families Solutions system provide a seamless system of care, addressing the needs of homeless individuals and families by supporting their ability to access services and connect to support systems in their communities. There is also a winter shelter in Long Beach. This is funded annually through the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority from from December 1st through March 15th. This program provides shelter services and linkages to housing through the inclement weather season. There are about 200 beds during that winter's shelter season. All of these resources and coordinated efforts have led to an overall reduction in homelessness. Based on the last two point in time counts. The point in time count as a count of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons on a single night in January. HUD requires that continuum of care conduct this count every two years. Our next count is scheduled to take place on Thursday, January 26th, 2017. We rely heavily on approximately 300 volunteers to take part in this important event. Based on increased calls for outreach, response and trends seen in neighboring communities, we do not anticipate seeing a decrease in our next count. Our most notable reduction has been among veteran homelessness. The city of Long Beach has a no wrong door approach to find and house our homeless veterans regardless of housing, health or discharge status. Partners, including the Long Beach VA Medical Center, the Health Department, US Vets, Mental Health America and 1736 Family Crisis Center work very closely to provide a system of care to veterans who are homeless and seeking services. We were able to house 355 veterans reaching functional zero, which means any homeless veteran who is seeking housing can be housed. The team provides emergency shelter, transitional and permanent housing, access to housing vouchers. Prevention funds. Deposit and rental assistance and case management. We identify new homeless veterans during daily outreach visits. We know who they are and we are working to house them. It's an ongoing process, but for any Long Beach veteran who becomes homeless, there are resources and housing available. Let me actually just pause right there for a second. So I just want to just note that I don't want to let that moment pass either. I think it's really, really incredible to see the work that's happened around housing veterans who have become homeless. And we I know we, along with a lot of our partners, announced this initiative probably maybe a year and a half ago or so. And it was a part of a national initiative that actually the first lady kind of took on through the White House. And working with HUD, working with the villages, working with U.S. vets, working with the Veterans Administration Hospital and all of our partners. And just miracle work has happened around this work of getting every single veteran that is looking for housing an actual place to live. And so I just want to if we can all just give to all of our partners that were involved, a just huge round of applause for their work and in doing that. As we all know, that that doesn't mean that veterans still don't fall into homelessness or there still isn't a challenge there because it's still the case . But we know that there has been a huge amount of of energy that has gone in and out. I will tell you that our health department team and Kelly, they have heard consistently from from us on this issue, and they have done just amazing work in leading this initiative. And so I just wanted to thank all of you before you moved on on that, because it is a huge accomplishment. What you guys have done there. Thank you. Continue. Thank you, Mayor. So the ten year plan. And first, I'd like to acknowledge we have our co-chairs of the ten year plan in the audience. So, Mike Murray, could you please stand? See here. There you are. And Steve Peck from U.S.. Thank you. So in 2008, a large collaborative effort of over 200 community stakeholders made up of service providers, businesses, faith based and faith based partners developed a ten year plan to prevent and end homeless in the city. A lot of work went into this report. It included a large number of recommendations for the city to take on a large a lot of innovative ideas and different things to try. This was presented to City Council, but at that time it was not adopted. Endorsements there. Has it been funded? So there has been a plan and it's been a sort of a guiding a guiding conversation. But throughout this time, there has not been a lot of additional resources put toward a number of those recommendations. Who else was in it? Who else participated in that planning processes in the room? Okay. Thank you. However, progress has been made. Well, originally so it was initiated in 2005 by Mayor O'Neill. And what came out of it was five key community strategies that were adopted by the City Council in 2009. The strategies were specifically focused on housing, economic stability, supportive services, community involvement and outcomes in evaluation. Through these strategies, the city steadily reduced the number of people experiencing homelessness throughout the city and effectively targeted resources to those with the greatest needs. We're going to go through each of the goals and some of the outcomes that have happened to date. So go one housing from 2009 to 2016. Over 800 permanent supportive housing beds have been created, bumping the number from 630 to 1452. In the same period, $3.5 million was allocated to Long Beach for rapid rehousing. In 2014 and 2015, the city itself facilitated the preservation of 1369 affordable units at risk of converting to market rate, which resulted in the extension of affordability for those housing units for the next 55 years. A total of nearly 2000 units have been preserved since 2008. As mentioned earlier, a number of housing developments are also underway to support homeless and people with mental illness at the Beacon Place, Anchor Place and others in the villages of Cumbria. In looking at goal too. In 2015 alone, over 6700 individuals accessed Goodwill Slack's job programs and Gateway Pacific. Gateway served almost 2400 people to support connection to employment. This is a total of over 9000 people in one year receiving employment support. When people come through the door of the Multi-Service Center, they are not only connected to Goodwill and Pacific Gateway, they are also connected to mainstream benefits, including Social Security, health insurance enrollment and benefits from the Department of Public and Social Services in an effort to get people reconnected to income sources. Go three are the supportive services goal. We've already discussed many supportive services that are in place in throughout Long Beach. Others include an increase in the mobile support mental health teams, which we call SB 82 street teams from the County Department of Mental Health. The children's clinic now has a mobile health clinic available to reach individuals who are living on the streets in Long Beach. We are engaged in discharge planning from hospitals and jail to ensure people are not released into homelessness. And we have increased outreach efforts overall, which has made a significant impact on reaching people who are living on the streets. Go for community involvement. We've been increasing community involvement and it's crucial to addressing homelessness holistically. Beginning in 2012, the city began increasing community engagement and building a governance structure for the continuum of care. The Continuum The Continuum of care board is made up of stakeholders in the community from different sectors, including the business improvement districts, public and private partnerships, our faith based community, the Long Beach Unified School District, and those who were formerly homeless. There's also a homeless service advisory committee whose members were appointed by the City Council and the mayor to represent each council district. All of these partners have deep ties in the community and committed to finding a solution to end homelessness. And go five outcomes in evaluation. The use of real time data is essential to appropriately evaluate and accurately understand the story. The city operates the homeless management information system that all partners are required to utilize to track, plan information and to coordinate care plans. The system not only connects all of the partners, it also helps us to highlight what we do well in areas for opportunity. Overall, the Long Beach system of care has been built with intention to specifically address the needs of our unique community. We also recognize that there are areas for growth and opportunity, which is why this session is so important and hearing from you is so important for future planning. We do have some challenges. Our city is facing multiple challenges in addressing homelessness and things are not getting easier. One key challenge is the increasing rents across the city. Apartment owners are choosing to increase rent and are asking people out to move out if they cannot afford them. This is leading to a crisis for families and seniors in Long Beach. More and more are being displaced. The amount of our Section eight vouchers is governed by HUD's fair market rates and are not as high as local rents in Long Beach. But our housing authority has recently negotiated exceptions to these rates and allowed it for a higher payment in hopes that apartment owners will increase acceptance. 60% of the housing stock in Long Beach consists of single to one single two one bedroom apartment, which limits the options even more for families with more than four people. We have a 2% vacancy rate in our city, which is very low, and it means competition for housing is an all time high. This is leading to fewer and fewer apartment owners interested in accepting Section eight vouchers. And again, it's we are spending over 490 individuals who are currently looking for housing. Statewide policy shifts and prison jail reforms are also making conditions more difficult. The loss of redevelopment removed the significant resource for building affordable housing. Prison and jail reforms have left more people on the streets, and many are being released without connection to housing. Others have more significant mental health and substance use issues. These are not currently being addressed due to lack of resources. We are seeing real increases in drug use on our streets and the drugs are becoming more and more potent and are causing more sometimes violent behavior. Right now, Long Beach only has 14 detox beds available for treatment for low income and homeless individuals. And that's not actually just for Long Beach. Those are for the region. In addition to these forces, there are higher levels of expectation from everybody in our city. Calls for response, as you've heard, have gone up significantly. Cleanup requests are going up as well and the costs are growing. So there's just an ongoing in the new challenges that are showing up. And we're doing our very best to address them. So I'm just going to talk briefly about Lincoln Park. So with the construction that's about to take place with City Hall. Lincoln Park will be closing within the next month. At that time, the project team will fence the Civic Center property to ensure safety during demolition and construction. This is a three year closure during the Civic Center renovation. The city and its partners have had a significant presence in the park, educating people about the closure as well as outreaching to connect them to services. More specifically, outreach efforts are being conducted daily by the Outreach Network. Monthly information sessions were held in the park starting six months prior to the fences going up by the Civic Center Task Force, led by the downtown Long Beach Business Association as the lead and the outreach network, signage informing the public of the park's closing has been posted around the park. Messaging regarding the park's closing is being distributed via social media outlets. Fliers have been placed on the fences and are regularly, regularly passed out downtown. Outreach and presentations have been have been made to neighborhood associations to inform residents of the construction project and timeline. And the city is also exploring alternative options for people to go at their own will, of course. We're going to shift. We're going to shift from from the services we have been providing to start to take a look about what a system looks like and how we can all contribute. There are many causes of homelessness. As you can see on the left side, what you'll find is those who when they walk in the door, those are the reasons at the very beginning, you know what they state is the reason that brought them to homeless. So you'll see loss of jobs evicted by a family member, abuse at home, incarceration. On the right side, you'll find that those things that have been in their lives are present in their lives that also contribute. So it may not be that that at that time the reason, but the many other reasons why people end up homeless . Given that this is the case, we have to think in terms of a comprehensive approach, focusing on just one thing, one, not solve the homeless issues now or in the future. Our current focus right now is on the red area. It's what's in front of us. It's where what everybody is focused on right now, how do we intervene and address what we're seeing right now on our streets? And there are many things that we can do. Street outreach and engagement, providing life skills and job skills, emergency transitional, permanent housing, much more mental health and substance abuse care . Ongoing supportive services, job skills training. There's a lot that we can be doing. But what we're facing now is that this is the most difficult and expensive time to work with individuals and families. It's why I have got Code Red, because we'd rather stop providing service now and provide it when it's easier to provide. And we keep people from entering homelessness. People are living in their cars, are on the streets, are experiencing much higher levels of disenfranchisement. Mental health conditions in substance abuse, addictions. There are multiple points in which we could proactively prevent homelessness. We call this upstream. So that's the green and the yellow. And so what we really want to be focusing on is the green. And we'll talk a little bit more about that. We want to start with our support of our youth and our young adults, particularly those transitioning out of foster care. Youth who are learning healthy have employment options, strong positive relationships, a place to live, are safe in their homes and communities they don't generally own. They don't generally end up homeless either as youth or as adults because they're experiencing success. Seniors who have support to stay in their homes, resourced to live and affordable housing options are also less likely to become homeless. We can help you with the many things that we can do to help, to prevent. So more housing. Housing for folks who need it now. But making sure that we have housing throughout the lifespan that is affordable. Mental health treatment is absolutely essential. Los Angeles County provides mental health and substance use treatment for Long Beach, either through direct service or by contracting providers. These services are not funded by the city. All mental health service within our city is provided by L.A. County. The Department of Mental Health is co-located at the Multi-Service Center to take referrals into our system. We really appreciate them as a partner. Mental Health America is also funded through our continuum of care and the Department of Mental Health to provide treatment and supportive housing for homeless individuals in our community. Substance use treatment is also a key area of need. There are currently only 14 detox beds and many of these in Long Beach and most are not language specific. Most detox take place takes place in emergency rooms or in jails. If criminal activity is present, most other substance use treatment is provided for those coming out of the criminal justice system. As there is additional funding for these individuals through HB 109 and probation funding. We continue to need additional housing and supportive services options such as child care and sufficient health care. So how can you help? How can the community help? So if we're focusing as far upstream as possible at the very early prevention, the key ways to help are supporting your schools with volunteering and mentoring, providing internships and learning opportunities for high school and college, connecting with individuals at different in difficult times. When you see someone struggling, connect, be aware of signs of mental health and substance use and help connect to treatment, provide jobs locally. The community can help in so many ways in our great city and we could start out by working together. It really gets everybody back on track to success and then we hopefully won't see people coming back. When we look at late prevention, meaning not yet homeless, but just on the verge and intervention, which is what we'll be doing now. We realize that there are so many good hearted people and organizations in Long Beach who want to help individuals and families, but often that help doesn't support a community solution providing food, clothing, tents, money, etc. to individuals in parks or on the streets and under bridges. It helps that individual for that moment or that day, but does not help them in the long term. We want to connect people to services to get them off the streets and into housing and services. And we need your help. Our next to slide show, you see a number of ways to truly support those who are homeless in the community. We ask that you donate funds and gift cards for services like haircuts or legal services to organizations who are serving people who are homeless. Volunteer to help move people in. Build a support network for people who are nearly housed. Help connect people with job skills and or employment opportunities. Sponsor furniture or other needed items for those who are moving in and have no furniture. Donate to the Mayor's Fund for Homeless in your utility bill or on the city's website. The power of everyone in this community coming together would be completely awesome. Oh, and by the way, the MSD says they need towels. This is a shameless plug because a lot of people come to shower and they need more towels. Sorry. So potential funding opportunities within our city. The city will be looking at a number of creative funding strategies, including easy ways to donate, such as parking meters designated for homeless electronic donation options, increased opportunities through the mayor's fund, social impact bonds and pay for performance strategies, as well as ongoing engagement and negotiation with the county regarding access to resources as they engage in growing its fund base for the housing, mental health, substance abuse and other supportive services. The Long Beach Continuum of Care is a best practice model nationally. We had a visit from the Appropriations Committee recently because they wanted to learn about how we coordinate so closely and how we've made so much progress and how we've used our unified funding agency strategy because they're still learning from us. However, we do not rest on our laurels in any way. We are aware that there are many innovative practices nationally to support homeless, and we're tracking on them. Unfortunately, many of these that sound really cool have unintended consequence, consequences that aren't really that positive. We want to make sure we're paying attention to this, that we do not end up in similar situations here. We're working closely with Los Angeles County to create opportunities for mental health and substance abuse diversion from criminal justice settings. We're looking at expanding opportunities at the Multi-Service Center and implementing clean teams to support the removal of materials such as couches and materials and mattresses in the city's alleys and parking lots. The one time $880,000 would be very helpful this year in supporting increased outreach in response. How are these resources will go fast because it does clean up. Costs are expensive. Looking forward, we have the perfect opportunity to develop a new, actionable plan to address homeless in Long Beach. It will take dedicated resources well beyond our current what our city currently invests. Previous planning has been unfunded, so results were limited. In an upcoming summit that includes a broad array of community, stakeholders will provide a perfect opportunity to continue to build on the five key strategies outlined in the ten year report recommendations. This will allow many to come together to generate solutions. This is currently being scheduled for spring 2017. In addition, we have a few stellar with us this year to help look at innovative practices and funding strategies to address homelessness. Views fellows who spent over 15 years in the private sector and bringing those skills to government for one year. I'd like to have Sharon stand up. Jim Moran is our Fuze fellow. You'll be seeing a lot of her in the next year. I'd also like to welcome Veronica join you see to it Veronica it's the front runner goes or other Hughes fellow. This year she'll be working on My Brother's Keeper and assisting with the Violence Prevention and Equity Office's. So we're very excited to have them. So thank you to the mayor and the Council for this generous public and private support to provide this incredible resource in these efforts. We will also be hosting community conversations. We want to focus on the earliest prevention opportunities as well as the best ways to intervene in homelessness now. It will be working over the next. We will be working over the next 6 to 9 months, including the summit and all of our other work together and engaging with you to build and to and to build upon the ten year plan and to build a plan for our city. Supporting people experiencing homelessness and addressing the impacts of homeless on our streets is a true balance in our community. Homelessness impacts so many at so many different levels. It is truly a community issue and requires full community engagement engagement to reach a solution based on participation in a number of community meetings and conversations. What I hear most is what is the city going to do about it? The city isn't doing enough. The city teams work tirelessly every day to respond to calls and to house people. We are one of the few cities in California that address homelessness in such a comprehensive way. Most other cities are just trying to figure it out. There just aren't enough city staff or enough funding to meet the community's expectations. If the expectation is that it's up to the city to make the change, it will take a while because we'll have to generate those resources on our own. We want to acknowledge many of you in the room who have taken the call to action to make a difference. It really has been my pleasure to work with you so far. All of us in this room, all of us in our great city, need to be part of the solution. We are the community. It would be easy for, as you speak today, to point a finger at the city and express your concerns. This will keep us and status quo. It won't forward any progress. You can also suggest solutions you believe the city should take on. But this continues to expect the city to be the only solution. In addition, many solution provided are focused on moving people or criminalizing homelessness. And this just is not allowable as it puts the city at great risk of lawsuit and court oversight. Instead, we challenge you that when you come to the microphone and when you speak in community meetings that you commit what you yourself will do to be part of a positive solution. Ten Homelessness in Long Beach. We've provided a number of suggestions earlier. As an apartment owner, provide units for Section eight and be flexible in your rents so that people, particularly families and seniors, can remain housed. Businesses and hotels provide job opportunities and training. Sponsor and organize volunteer groups. Donate meaningfully to organizations, individuals and families. Volunteer and support organizations who serve the homeless. Sponsor an individual or a family as they are moving in. By creating a moving kit list of opportunities. As long individually we can make progress. But we are only truly powerful when we come together for our community. Thank you for your time tonight. That concludes my report and we are open for questions. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was a great presentation to you. I know your entire team. I know you worked very hard on that. We're going to now turn over to the city council, all have comments and questions and then we'll go to the public after that. So let me start with Councilman Price. Thank you. I just want to start out by making a few comments to city staff and thanking you for the presentation tonight, hearing what you do and the broad level of service that's involved in your operation. I think it's very important for our community to hear. I've had an opportunity to hear it several times and I do get very frustrated when people operate with assumptions that appear to be misinformed in terms of what the city is doing. So I applaud you for educating all of us tonight and for the education that you've provided to our individual council districts. I know that our district has had three community meetings on this topic. Teresa has been at all of them, starting with about a year and a half ago. And recently we had one. We had over 200 and about 250 people there. And this is a very emotionally charged issue. And I really like hearing what Kelly said in her closing remarks tonight about the challenge that if people are going to raise frustrations about the issue, that they also balance that with what they're willing to commit in terms of their personal resources to finding a solution or a problem. I look out at the audience today and I'm so appreciative for the many people in this room who have. An unbelievable level of compassion and heart, not just for the people who are going through the difficult times, but also for the city of Long Beach because they're trying to be proactive and be part of the solution. I look at Steve, Larry, I've had opportunities, invited me. My family and I have gone to the U.S., oh, at the first congressional church. And we have served food there and plan to go again. I think about LBJ and the very progressive efforts that they have taken on to address the issue in their community. And of course, Craig's editorial in the press telegram was very moving to me and something that I wish that many people in the city would read. I think about Gio Ferrera's efforts in her community to try to be a change agent. Allison Crip, Joe Ganim, all of these individuals. Gaylord from my district is here. He's really trying to educate his community. These individuals, among many that I haven't named, are partners to us in this problem. There is a lot of frustration. I sometimes I read some of the I try not to do it too often, but sometimes I read the social media posts and things about people who say, well, you know what, the city or our Susie Price, you know, she seems like she's still trying to figure out this homeless thing. You know, maybe we can we can have somebody there who actually knows what to do with the problem. And I always say if there's someone out there that knows how to fix this issue, I would like to know their name. I would like to vote for them. I would like to hug them. I would like to welcome them to the city because this is a region regional problem and we're all trying to work together to figure it out. And so all of the people that I just referenced and many others that I didn't are trying to be partners with us as we think more long term. You know, some of the things that we often hear about and I want to ask a couple of questions about it tonight, but some of the things that we often hear about are suggestions that people give on how to deal with the situation are one, you know, not legal or to a short sighted, you know, you can't move people from one area to the other. It doesn't really address the bigger problem. If you have somebody that, let's say, for example, needs substance abuse treatment, we need to figure out a way how to get them the substance abuse treatment because moving them from one location to another is really a short term solution for the people that are in the immediate vicinity of the area where the movement is happening. And that's one of the biggest things that's been really my focus given my background in my career. The substance abuse aspect has been a very concerning issue for me because I don't think we have the resources or the mechanisms to help people get the treatment that they need so that they can start to make some of the changes that we were talking about in terms of long term solutions. So I'm always interested in that. So I wanted to ask kind of start off with that Kelly and or Teresa, have we noticed that we've had a rise in the level of folks who maybe are suffering from substance abuse problems? And if so, what opportunities do we have for them to get treatment? We are saying we are seeing an increase in drug use on the streets. The other thing that we're seeing is that the drugs that are being used are causing more erratic behaviors. And so what we're finding is that, you know, as some people are coming to the multi-service center and other places, we're just noticing this river that is more and more difficult to to to have conversations and to engage with people. We do need substance abuse treatment. So the county, through its Department of Public Health, provides that treatment through using, you know, Medicaid funding through the state. But there just are not a whole lot of providers within the city of Long Beach that provide unfunded or Medi-Cal, Medi-Cal substance abuse treatment. Do we have any residential drug treatment programs in the city of Long Beach? So if. You know. Safe refuge. Yeah. Safe refuge. And then there's redgate. Thank you. I don't have the full list here in front of me in Tarzana. Yeah. He'll Hey, everyone, everyone who has been experiencing this and the community will share. There are waiting lists for all of them and they are difficult to get into. I imagine also that even even if we had more available, which it sounds like there's definitely a need there to provide those opportunities, even if we had those available. I imagine just on my own personal experience. With folks who have had substance abuse problems very close to me, it's hard to get them to actually seek the treatment , especially an intense treatment like a residential treatment program where you have to go through the detox and all of that. Are there any mechanisms to incentivize treatment? I know that prior to Prop 47, we had drug court, which could incentivize rehab in lieu of a felony conviction. But what do we have now? Do we have anything that can incentivize drug treatment? There are not a whole lot of incentives to drug treatment beyond when we're doing outreach and engagement. The more that we build those capacities with folks, we build that relationship. They start to understand that they need it. And then we work to get them into treatment to help support their ability to move, you know, to help them maintain their housing. We do use the housing first model in Long Beach, which means that anybody you know that it's not a requirement to be clean before getting into housing. So, so so people will be housed. We can then help support whatever is going on from there. There is a community collaborative courtroom that is in Long Beach and they are working to be able to provide some some incentives through that courtroom into treatment, into some connection. We're looking at some other national models as well with the with the city prosecutor and the police department that would be around and offering treatment opportunities in connection to treatment opportunities in lieu of citation. Now, so if I'm hearing you correctly and this is something I didn't know, so we do offer housing even if someone is under the influence of a substance and maybe hasn't detoxed yet that the housing is still offered. Yes, housing first is housing first. I mean, that's you know, that doesn't rely on any other it doesn't rely on them changing their lifestyle or anything. It's like we want to make sure people are housed and if that is your most baseline of service from there we help support people moving into other support services. And then do we have the treatment and services available for them if they do get into housing to help them go through that transition immediately? We do the detox and the rehabilitation. We don't. There are services available and supportive services models, but there's not sufficient. And what we find sometimes that people are in the housing authority or other places like that, they may start falling out of service. So we get people housed and because their substance use is not managed or their mental illness is not managed, and they start to fall out of housing. And what we are seeking to do is provide additional services to try and unders to put together a model where we could do additional scattered site support so that those who are in the housing authority or that we're housing through any other Section eight or any other ways to make sure that we have stronger support systems for them to help them remain in housing. There's a couple of things that we often hear. I'm not sure if my colleagues hear them. I'm sure they do, but I think they're myths. But I'm not sure. Are there, to your knowledge, different cities busing in their homeless and dropping them off in Long Beach? I get calls about that on a daily basis. We have had those questions. To our knowledge, no people have free will to get on a bus and travel wherever they want to go. But there, to our knowledge, there are no cities that are intentionally filling up bus loads and dropping them off in Long Beach. Okay. And similarly, you talked about vouchers. Can you tell me can you tell us a little bit more who qualifies for vouchers and how many hotels do we have in the city where they can use the vouchers? Sure, the cons the city contracts with two specific hotels in the city that can use vouchers. Folks that get vouchers through the multi-service center have to come in or come in through the door. They go through a full assessment and they their homeless status is acknowledged and then they receive a voucher and that's for a hotel. So there's two different vouchers, though. There's hotel vouchers and then there's vouchers for section eight. So that's where there's some confusion that lies. Okay. So the hotel vouchers do is there a priority system for who gets those and how many do we issue? So. So when people are coming in to meet with the case manager and receive it, they start they get on a housing plan. Hotels are used as a bridge to housing. So if there's not an emergency shelter bed available, then that's when a hotel will be used. Okay. And is there a priority for families or veterans when it comes to those vouchers? The families are, ah, they go through the Family Solution Center and they have a certain amount of hotel vouchers that they utilize. And then through the multi-service center, through our case managers, they serve veterans and individuals there. So their Family Solution Center is also co-located at the Multi-Service Center. So everybody is connected in that space. And how many vouchers are we talking about in terms of the hotel vouchers? What would what's a rough estimate of what we would get? Our team is offering its. What's it? It's fewer than 50. Yeah, it's a small amount. Fewer than 50 on a monthly basis. Annual basis. An. Annual basis. Less than 50 vouchers on an annual basis. So I think that's a myth, too, that we hear a lot about, is that the city, you know, that people are choosing maybe to be homeless because the city is giving out these vouchers. That seems to be an incorrect information. Okay. I'm going to stop asking questions so that my colleagues can ask a few questions. And then I'd love to hear from the public as well, because I could go all night and I won't. Thank you. Next up, we have Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mayor Garcia. So I want to just begin by thanking staff. I was impressed and a number at numerous points during your presentation. And I know you have limited resources and it's easy to to say what should be done. But with limited resources, you prove and demonstrate why we were fortunate to have a health department. We're able to do so much more here locally than a lot of the many other communities can do, while still using very little of our general funds resources. So I just want to start off by saying thank you and when you make sure you clap for them. So there was a comment about homelessness as a community. And I can tell you, homeless the homeless community is a community. There's we actually have a nonprofit here in Long Beach that they volunteer. It's called Wrap the Kids. They volunteer, they make they knit sweaters and they're made up for the most part of active homeless folks. And I can tell you, they volunteer at higher levels then, you know, then neighborhood activists we've seen for many, many years. And they are a community. And we should think of this in this conversation. We should keep it in context that this is these are human beings. So I totally understand when we say what am I willing to do frame our own, you know, our conversation in that in that context, I just have a few questions. And, you know, I say few, about four or five. We've been home to the winter shelter, the Long Beach once winter shelter the last four or five years in District nine. And I'm just curious, how many people do we know on hand? And I didn't see it on the slide. But how many people do we typically serve at the winter shelter every year? So typically, on average, about 200. There's 200 beds at the winter shelter. So the average capacity through the winter, the beds are typically full. Okay. And I know that we're in. It's October now, and winter's winter is coming. Oh, I got to say. I got to say it. So I. I know that. I know that that's happening. What where are we in the process of setting up our our shelter? I know that we typically last few years, we've gotten better at notifying the public and going through that process. But where are we today with setting up the winter shelter? Sure. Well, the winter shelter is actually funded by Los Angeles County, the Lahsa. And so they release an RFP and then the provider of the winter shelter apply for that RFP. So the city of Long Beach doesn't release that RFP. It's not under our purview. We're more of a middle, middle person for for lack of a better term. And so it's October, the RFP will be released soon and then the application the applicants will apply. And so we're in our process through the city. The city council will be receiving a letter very soon about our process. Thank you. I know we typically have to like declare an emergency and take all those steps. Right. So so thanks for the update and keep us posted. I had a chance to go to the housing authority headquarters maybe a month or so ago. And it was it was really shocking to hear that there's almost 500 people with vouchers ready to be placed. But we haven't found the places to to take them, the apartment owners to actually take them. And I had a sort of off the cuff conversation with property owners today. And I you know, I would say there might be some immediate opportunities to help serve these people. And when I think of, you know, the Section eight voucher, I think these are people that are right at the brink that can be helped from slipping into active homelessness. So so have we engaged the property owners and talked about what the barriers are and educated them, that we can actually pay a higher amount to make sure these people are are placed? But what what steps would be taken to think creatively about making sure we're using these vouchers? Well, the housing authority meets regularly with the apartment associations. They presented every conference that they can get into to share information. They are on first name basis with every owner that is out there that currently takes Section eight. And they're working on first name basis for almost every other owner in the city, really seeking opportunities to to create those spaces. In addition, they have negotiated with the Federal Housing Authority to be able to to have an exception payment or acceptance standard, which will allow us to pay more than what the current standard is. So in some communities, it can be up to 100, 120% of that standard, which we're hoping it gets us much closer to the actual rents for those apartments. And we believe that that should help in the in the rentals. Great. Thank you. And I would say I would say, you know, based on the conversation I had today, I think it would be be good to just have a brainstorm session. Again, I know it's one thing to meet routinely. It's another thing to have a specific conversation about, you know, how do we turn it up right now and address this need of this 490 people? I think we can. I am hopeful that we can move the needle in five more units immediately. And I'm willing to call out, you know, the apartment owners and say, help us meet this need. You know, we do a lot of this council to try to make sure things are business friendly to apartment owners and things like that and make adjustments well so that this is an opportunity for the apartment was to step up and help the city meet its commitment on homelessness. I would also say with respect to I heard the mention that we do use these vouchers on on hotels. And that made me just think about where we have a number of underutilized nonconforming motels that are being used for a lot of other purposes. Have we explored whether we could modernize or convert those motels into quality transitional housing? And can we use some of those funding to accomplish that, some of the Section eight HUD funding for that. The Section eight funding can only be used in a place that has cooking. So a microwave and a bathroom. So. So they could be they could be they could be updated. So sometimes an SRO or a single room occupancy unit don't have those in. The definitions within the city are different. So there's the motels and you could use section eight as sort of efficiency units one by one room units as long as there's cooking in a in a restroom in that room. We have not currently looked into modernization at this point, but we have been approached by a couple of different housing providers and rehab providers who might be interested in that conversation. Thank you. And I'll just close with just some thoughts that I have about this, this entire issue with the loss of redevelopment, that was a significant blow to the local funding that we had to actually develop robust, affordable housing. 20% of all the tax increment had to go to affordable housing development. And with the loss of redevelopment, we lost that tool. So we think we need to go back to the drawing board and be more creative. And I know there's efforts around town about this, but I would say, you know, if you were to look at an affordable housing conversion, one to have in mind is the Bellwood Arms on Atlantic or across from Halton Park. This place looks fantastic. It is. You know, it's inside and out. And if I were in college, I would love to stay at a place like that. And right next door, the market rate housing. I took a tour of some market rate housing right next door and it was very substandard in the conditions of living and the affordable housing was cheaper and higher quality. I think we need to be smarter about changing the conversation about affordable housing and I completely support that. And secondly, we are a large city and we need we need to make sure we have given honest conversation, inclusionary housing. We need to interconnect density, bonuses, incentives, whatever we can be creative and think of. We need to connect that to inclusionary housing. I'm okay publicly saying that I support it. Boston. Denver. Sacramento. San Diego. San Francisco. All have inclusionary housing. Long Beach should have a real conversation about it. So that's that's where I'll end. But thank you so much. Thank you. Next up, we have Councilwoman Gonzalez. Yes. I too only have about 20 questions, so hang tight. I'm kidding. I just want to thank everybody here in the room as well. I know everybody's been working so very hard. I can't even name everybody because it's just been incredible. I think together we are a lot stronger and I'm just very proud to see the direction we're headed. And I want to thank, first and foremost our health department. I know you all are working very hard and diligently oftentimes on grant funding and it's tough. But I want to thank you all for your your efforts. So every single inner city employee within the health department. I want to thank you. Yes. So a couple quick questions. And some things have been brought up in the past that I would like to just kind of reopen the discussion to. There have been there has been talk about individuals with pets in shelters that would include animals. And so I don't know where that discussion ended up. Do we know where that's ended up? We we are shelters do allow pets. We do. Yeah. People can bring their pets along. And our the staff work tirelessly to make sure that people can stay connected to their pets. Many of those pets end up coming home with us. But, you know, people that's there's a lot of people's support system. And so they become service animals and support to folks. And so it's very important that people can stay connected to that. But not all shelters. I mean, some shelters maybe allow pets, but I don't believe all do. In the single shelters. Okay. Just wanted to clarify. Okay. So if we can get a number on that, I'd be good to find out how many shelters do allow, because we hear that coming up a bit. Secondly, in regards to our youth, I know there's been talk about students at Cal State, Long Beach, one in ten are homeless. That's been a big topic of discussion. I believe there had been a grant received by the university last year and also Long Beach City College. I know that there are individuals that are homeless there as well. So what is our discussion around students and what are we how are we working in conjunction with our universities? And sure. We're actually working very closely with the university, with Cal State, Long Beach, and also with the City College to address the student needs. So that staff, many of the staff have gone out on a monthly basis to engage with the university and the city college. And I'm continuing to sit on panels. We're being invited to do presentations, to engage with them, and we're inviting them to be part of our continuum of care general membership team to make sure that we're engaged with not just the colleges, but also with with Long Beach Unified School District as well. So that's great. Thank you very much. And then I, I also have a question on the LGBTQ community within our homeless reporting. So every January when we get this report, do we know how many individuals identify as LGBTQ and what additional resources may be provided to them with that. During the the point in time count, that question is not asked. Okay. Is that something we can add? Because I think that would be beneficial. Yeah, we're just starting discussions about different questions that we want to in and include in that point in time count and our Fuze fellow is going to participate in some of that as well. And we really want to gather more information about who our population is and I mean who our community members are and where they're coming from. So that's. Wonderful. Amazing. Can I add. One thing to that point before you continue, Councilwoman? So I just want to make sure, because I think that's an important point I've read and I could be wrong, but I read that the national statistics on LGBT, on homeless youth is about 40% of all homeless youth are actually LGBTQ, which is really high versus obviously the current population. And so I think what the councilwoman is also speaking to is that there is a there are very special needs within that population on top of the the stress of being homeless. And there are domestic violence. There's issues of what's going on at the home, of not having family support. And so I just I think I'm really glad that Councilman Gonzales brought this up. And I would be interested to just exploring what the best practices are around this question, because I know it's especially true within homeless youth. And so I'm glad that got brought up. So, Councilman Gonzales. Yes, thank you for reinforcing that message. I think it's really key and I'm glad will be including that in our reporting with our Fuze fellows. I'm glad to hear that. And then I know I had brought up there will be a report coming back, I believe, in November. There's a number of items that I included in that agenda item that include substance abuse, housing, children and families. In regards to the substance abuse issue, are we looking at any models and can we bring that forward in November with just a couple of models? That may be I mean, it may be pie in the sky and too costly, but at least if we have some framework around what that may look like, I know Councilwoman Pryce brought up some great points in regards to substance abuse, but I think it's such a national epidemic right now. I think it needs more emphasis. And so it'd be great to get more information back in November related to certain models we can implement. You can make sure that's included. Thank you. And then a couple more questions. So I know I believe we talked about this Kelly weekend outreach. What type of support do we have on the weekends? Currently, the phone line is available. People can call in and on Monday morning, first thing, that phone line is checked and then we conduct outreach throughout the rest of the throughout the rest of the week. Folks can call two, one, one if they need additional supports and they can provide connection to other services as well. Okay. And there's not any physical outreach being conducted over the weekend, though, so it's just the hotline, is that correct? Correct. Okay, great. And I think the last question I had was just. I've just been corrected. Mental health America does do outreach. Our city staff does not do outreach and mental health in Marion. Does that make it perfect? Great. And then one last question I have is in relation to housing, of course, which is very important. Do we have any idea? You know, a lot of questions have been or topics of discussion have been around families. Of course, you had discussed, you know, rents increasing. We have a lot of families that need housing. I've also heard of, you know, artists, teachers. Do we have an idea of what type of demographic could be served best with affordable housing or is it just families at this point? Do we know any other specific demographics? I know it's a pretty. Category so it's certainly going all. Yeah, I know everybody. Yeah. So that the that information we don't have that information right here but we can we can be provided. But really we're looking at the need across all different populations and backgrounds. Sure. Okay. Because I don't know if there's different types of funding models that could be used. I mean, every time we think of affordable housing, we often go towards seniors and veterans, which is great. We definitely need that. But I think there's also other groups that could be served as well, and maybe there's an easier time in getting funding for those specific groups. That's just the the reason I'm asking. Sure. If you if you'd like more specific information, Patrick, do you have do you have that information where we can get we can come back to you? Okay. That would just a difference. Okay. Do you want to bring that back in November as well? We'll just bring it back. We'll bring it back. Sorry. Okay. Yeah. That's that's an yeah, that's an entirely different subject. Homelessness. And we can come back with that. Okay, perfect. Thank you, Pat. And so I also want to just add that I think also our police department, our quality of life team is absolutely incredible. Yes, of course. For them as well. I was just speaking to some downtown residents yesterday at their meeting and touted the great work of our quality of life team. If you are on Facebook and you ever get a chance to go on Officer Brad, few tax page to see real life what he's doing with mint, which many service providers do. But the fact that our police officers are doing this daily along the river, you know, in encampments, just in the trenches, working directly with homelessness, I urge you to look at their Facebook pages and see what they're doing. So thank you all for your amazing work and I appreciate it. Go ahead. Go. Okay. What? Yeah. So I want to also. Yeah. Okay. Councilmember Pierce, you're up next. Thank you, Vice Mayor. Um, so I want to, you know, echo everything that my colleagues have said about thinking, you know, everybody that's been thanked. Everybody that showed up today. Everybody that is trying to help us find a solution. I do think that Long Beach, you know, from the conversations I have had, is above and beyond what a lot of other cities have done. And so being thankful for that and then challenging ourselves to be bold and innovative and think outside the box is the best way that we as a community are going to be able to, you know, resolve and tackle some of these issues that are not just Long Beach issues, but are regional issues. And so I have obviously a few questions and I think. You know, first want to ask, are there opportunities, training opportunities that the department, the health department or other organizations in the city are doing to engage businesses and residents who might come across people that are homeless? Currently we are getting a lot of questions and requests for training. So we have a mental health first aid training that we encourage anybody to participate in. And we're all also connected to trauma informed care training that we also encourage folks to participate in. But that request is coming to us quite often and staff do informal trainings, we go out and present quite a bit, but we are looking further into developing something more formal. Thank you. I think that a few of my colleagues and I would definitely I know that we're meeting later on in the week and so thank you for that, particularly before Linkin Park closes to ensure that those communities that might not experience as many homeless will have the training and support that they need on how to interact and who to call and know what steps to take should that time come? I wanted to ask about the vouchers. I know that, you know, there's the limit on the way around 50 a year. Is there is there a mechanism to increase the number of vouchers for the hotel stay? I'm sorry. So a mechanism for an increase? Mm hmm. Just money. Yeah. Just money. I just need more resources around that. Yeah. Okay. And where do the resources come for those hotel vouchers? County through grants. Through grants. Okay. Yeah. The council vice mayor brought up the sorrows. And I think that this is a conversation we've had and not only with the city, but talking about private developers that might want to, you know, support helping the city. And there are challenges with the homeless community. And, you know, some ideas have been thrown out there about taking those. SOROS Having a developer buy them and then having the city or an entity within the city provide wraparound services as bridge housing or transitional housing that would last in between 6 to 9 months while they find permanent housing since we have a 2% vacancy. What are some challenges to doing that? Well, certainly right now we don't have the service providers to provide those wraparound services. I mean, we have we have service providers. We don't have the funding to provide those wraparound services. So we would be looking at that and it would be working with the planning department and others around housing and the focus on that and the and the SRO. So once again, SRO cannot be you cannot use Section eight supports for those right. That you can for you can four motels. And so it's really having a conversation in the city around those specific those specific units and then looking for the supportive resources to make sure that people can stay in and have the ability to stay. And I had a great meeting just today, just happen to be today with Brian from Century Villages. And, you know, that question came up and talking about how much it would cost per unit. So you had a motel that was converted to be able to be used longer term wraparound services, around 1200 at a year per person . What does it cost that that it would cost to provide wraparound services outside of the housing. I don't have a specific number for that, but we can get back to you with that number. I have another question. It's the city participating in any pharmaceutical takeback events. No, not at this time. Okay. And then one last question. One of the challenges being the clean ups and the fact that, you know, whether it's in Bixby Park or Lincoln Park, that people are leaving some of their belongings in places. I know that we have places for them at the Multi-Service Center. Is there a barrier or a reason not to provide things like lockers in areas that tend to have a lot of homeless people around? Sometimes some of the to have lockers. We're not really sure what goes into them. And so it's it's it can be a real security risk. And so that's one of the reasons why we have not moved forward in that direction. We do store when when cleanups are conducted. We do provide storage of personal possessions for 90 days and people can go and pick those up. Okay. Thank you. And the last thing I'll say is, I know that you and I have talked a little bit, Kelly, about trying to do something like a day laborer program, you know, as we're talking about all the areas of focus here and economic support. And I just look forward to continuing that conversation on how we can partner with organizations like MH or villages to support getting people into some some jobs that will give them integrity as well as a paycheck. And so I look forward to that discussion. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. Great discussion. I also want to add my voice to the health department and Mr. Colby and her staff for the great, wonderful work they're doing with help with the homeless. I don't have any questions per say in regards to what's going on. And we know basically what what those issues are. But I'm looking at slide number 47 where how to prevent and intervene in homelessness. And we're looking at the various, uh, bullets there that, uh, they provide some assistance and guidance in how to prevent and intervene. And what I see here is it's a multi-jurisdictional effort that needs to take place. We need to we need to work more closely with our partners, with with the county, with the state, with our neighboring cities, because it's always a concern. And I want to acknowledge the presence of a Connie's people from a supervisor cannabis office who is here, because cannabis office has been a very, very supportive friend of the city of Long Beach. And unfortunately, he's termed out and you'll be leaving office very soon. And and with him goes Connie. And Connie has been a champion for the city of Long Beach. And everything that we've done in any area, and especially when we're talking about homelessness as well. So I want to congratulate her on her service as a. And having said that, you know, we we have had some discussion about some other ways that we could address it. But one of the questions I was going to ask but it's already been addressed was this whole issue about Housing First, the Housing First model, because I think that that's an important aspect of how we can deal with homelessness in regards to having. Housing that we need to we need to find that first. I mean, that's, you know, the definition of homelessness is, oh, so we got to find people homes and and when I'm talking about a multi-jurisdictional effort is also a multi community effort that we've talked about affordable housing in regards to maybe providing affordable apartment apartments, looking at single remarkable things we're looking at maybe when the next time we have a new development, you know, putting in there some kind of aspect of of affordable accommodations in those areas because that's that's where the problem is. When you have a 2% vacancy rate, there's not going to be much out there. And having an increase of vouchers is great but if there's not the of the housing and is not available to people of the largest we want but the but there's not going to be any use for them. So we have to look at our housing stock. We have to look at housing developments that are going to be coming in to the city where we're basically built out. So there's not going to be a whole opportunity for that. And so the only other way is to build up. And and in the end, I think that when it comes down to homelessness, I think most of them are not looking for handouts. They're looking for hands up hand ups. So we need to change how we we we view and we look at homeless individuals and trying to not help them but perhaps guide them into those areas that that they need support. And because I as an example, there's a major a homeless encampment in my district in Will Springs Park, and out of perhaps 50 individuals that are there, only one accepted assistance. So that that says a lot about what kind of outreach work we're doing to these individuals and why are so many of the other ones. I'm 49, are not accepting the services, so there's got to be something there that we're not doing right that we need to evaluate, though, when it comes down to making an offer, assisting them with their with their homeless issues and the great majority of them not wanting to to accept it. So we need to perhaps reevaluate how we're doing it and and perhaps, you know, be little before we get out there into into the service area, be introspective in terms of what are we doing wrong so that we can address their needs a lot better. And as I've said before, I mean, the the there's no stronger commitment to addressing the issue than the commitment that we make as a city with our financial commitment and putting more money into it to help the Health Department and the Homeless Services Bureau from relying solely on grants from the state and from the feds and from everywhere else, and institutionalize a lot of these these efforts that we're trying to do out there. And I don't know how we're going to do that. Obviously, taxes is a bad word, although Measure eight passed pretty good. But, you know, we need to look at at how we as a community have to have to deal with that and that Slide 44, it basically tells me that that we that that it takes a village and it's going to take a lot more than that as well to address this homeless issue if we want to really want it to go away. Jobs, housing, health care, counseling, all that. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Hastert. Thank you. And I'll try to be brief. I'm battling a little bit of a chest cold right now. And many of my my colleagues have addressed many of the points that I wanted to address. I want to thank staff for an excellent presentation. All of our partners, Continuum of Care partners on path. I want to thank my and my homeless advisory commission advisor, Andy Kerr, who was actually here with him pretty regularly. And I thank the mayor for for calling the study session, because this is long overdue. Yes. I think as evident from the presentation, we've done some great work and we're doing some great work here in the city of Long Beach. But looking at the numbers, we still have room for improvement. And as we strive for excellence in government, we should be striving for continuous improvement. And so I'm really concerned that two outreach workers is not going to get it done for the city. I've said that over and over again during our last budget conversation as well, and particularly when you hear that multiple contacts are needed to the homeless to to actually get them to move to outreach workers 2120 400 homeless in the city. That math doesn't add up, doesn't make me feel inspired that we're going to get things done and resolve the issues the way they need to be resolved. And I agree with Kelly's point that we all need to be part of the solution, that that's extremely important. Jeanine. Councilmember Pearce touched on the need for. More volunteer opportunities. And I think that's something that we need to really, really explore, volunteer and training opportunities. We need to have a boot camp to address this crisis. As I'm looking at this crowd right here. There's clearly a sustainable approach to having some volunteers go out there to help with the outreach and to get services and help for those in need. So that's something that I'm looking forward to potentially working on as well as as a solution. When listening to the presentation and all of the comments thus far, it's clear that we need to expand our capacity for for housing and resources to and to be creative in doing so for temporary and long term housing. There's recently was a bill passed in Sacramento and it was was pretty contentious, but it was SB 1069. Are you staff aware of that Bill right now? It was passed. That was, I guess, the the the quick name for it was Granny Flats that would allow for residential homes, a allow for residential properties to expand on their properties and build small apartment units. There was a concern about local, local control there, but that bill passed and was signed by by the governor, believe about a week or so ago that we would talk about expanding capacity and all of us be a part of the solution. That is a big one. One way that we can look at doing that and I would love to get some. I know we're going to have a state ledge committee meeting in a couple of weeks next week. No, two weeks. We'll get a report back on that there. But I think I'd like to get a report back for the full council on that as well, because that that may expand some opportunity. And I want to thank the council for also voting to to send a strong message to Sacramento, asking the governor to declare homelessness as a as a as an emergency crisis in the state that could and would bring, you know, $100 million or so that could be divided up into various counties and bring resources to assist us. And so we'll continue to work on that and and other funding opportunities. At the end of the day, we have to do a gut check as a as a city. Other cities, other public entities are looking at ways to fund homelessness. We brought forth an item that we'd like to see piloted to have parking meters installed throughout the old parking meters installed throughout the city to to help individuals raise money and raise consciousness about the need to help those in need. And we'll continue to work on this. But I wanted to just just just raise my give my, my, my support to this. The study session is I've learned quite a bit here. Even though you sit on the city council, you're you're hit with a deluge of issues. You never know. You don't always get to dig in deep and understand and an issue as deeply as this. And so I really want to appreciate staff for their presentation and just let you all know that I'm committed to, to, to moving this issue as long as I'm up on this dais. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Councilmember Supernova. Thank you. And I'll be the last member speaking tonight, so be patient and I'll be very, very brief because I'd like to hear our experts in the audience speak also. I'm pretty new to this. I've just been involved since 2008. But I do recall the homeless count in January of 2009. I had the area of the greater Los Altos area, huge area, and we had one person in our homeless count. I would hazard a guess that that will not be the case this coming January. I'd also just like to thank staff and they do such a great job out there. I see Shannon in the audience and also I don't know if Alison remembers, but in 2008 I came to visit you, a private citizen. And it's just so ironic. You summed it all up that day. I think it was March 28, and we have so many of the same issues today, but we've made a lot of progress nonetheless. But Councilmember Pryce. Just reminded me of something in your comments about the disinformation out there are urban legends. And I know Teresa and Shannon. I were in a meeting with some business leaders and someone took some shots at community hospital. That patient dumping just totally unsubstantiated issues. Oh one was giving drugs that they're selling on the street, and none of that was true. But community hospital had to respond. And I thought, boy, the irony here is the 28 bed psych unit and the top of the tower, a community hospital, and I'd hate to see that ever leave. And I just start to see. Us protect. And save the resources we do have. Because if we lost those 28 beds, you have 72 hour, 5150 holes, you have 24 hour voluntary services there. And so I guess that's the message I'd like to leave everyone and such as preserve what we have and then try to enhance new ideas. Also, the last point I'd like to make is that we talk about this singular entity, homeless, and as the folks in the audience, many of you know, it's far from that. It's an incredibly diverse population of individuals. And to that, I think it's going to take a diverse group of resources to address this issue. And I'd like to suggest that we ask all those who are compassionate on the homeless issues for help, and let's ask those who are not quite compassionate yet. And what I a line I use when in these meetings is, you know, I don't need you to be compassionate, but at least be practical, be pragmatic about this, that the best way to address the issue is to help with the services. So that's my message for tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. I'm going back to Councilmember Pearce. Just to mess with you, Councilmember Juvenile, since you said you were the last, I did have one more question and I just want to thank everybody for putting together the rapid response team, the fact that we'll have the van that was included in the budget this year. I know that there had been some talk about that being about a 40 hour a week proactive kind of look. And I was hoping that we could come back with maybe what are the times that we get majority of our calls and trying to make sure that we have that team during those hours and possibly on the weekends as well, knowing that, you know, as a city, we're not providing that service on the weekends. And so just wanted to make sure that we included that. We will come back with the plan. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. That concludes the council questions for now on the topic. And I'm going to go and turn this over now to public comment. And just like we would normally do public comment, we'll go to line up and just as a reminder, please, guys, so we can just orderly make sure you say your name, okay, so that we know who you are for the record. And we will go ahead and have the timer up for you to comment. Hey, everyone, I need you. I need everyone to quiet down, please, so we can be respectful. Sure. Who is because there's a significant amount of folks. We're going to begin by doing some comments at 3 minutes and then we might have to go down to 2 minutes as we go into the into the study session. Okay. Unless there's objection from the counsel. So we're going to begin. Please go ahead. Hello, my name is Elizabeth Waite. I am the student rep on the homelessness task force at Long Beach City College. I'm also on the PCC Student Council representing the Senior Studies Program. As Councilman Super now pointed out, the homeless are not one large, faceless entity. There's a lot of diversity in the group, and I'm here to speak on behalf of one particular constituency which are homeless college students. There is an epidemic of homelessness on college campuses. There was recently an article in the L.A. Times that reported that at least one in ten CSU students is homeless. And to my knowledge, 500 students at Long Beach City College are documented as homeless. It is a very difficult problem there. I've had I have personal experience with this issue, and I cannot stress how hard it is to try and go through college and also not have a roof over your head and live out of your car or couch surf or live in shelters. It is it's enormously difficult. And it's hard because these are not people that look like your typical homeless person. They aren't necessarily on drugs. They don't necessarily have mental health issues. They look like integrated members of society. But as students, they do not have a place to live. And there I guarantee you probably know somebody or know somebody who knows a homeless college student. It's it's it's. An oh, we have an overwhelming need for help in this issue. I it's. Really staggering. It's really staggering. I work with Virginia to revise and her in Ginny Baxter has people coming to them every single day with needing assistance, with rent, with housing, with books. Because the problem, the strain is so intense right now. As I said, I'm the rep of student homelessness. October 9th, we're having an event where it's going to we're going to raise money for homeless students in Albuquerque. It's going to be at the Lacy campus. And I want to do everything possible to work with you guys. I'm new to this, you know, advocacy. I'm new to all of these. The complexity of the issue. I understand it's a very difficult issue. There's a large number of societal factors going into creating it. But I want to do everything possible to collaborate with you guys and, you know, get resources and help and do whatever I can to assist in this problem and speak for this constituency of people. Once again, it's obviously housing is cost effective in terms of taxes. In a most practical level, when you house people, you don't have to pay for them going to the E.R. or going and receiving other different types of services. Ultimately, it's an investment because it cuts down the costs over a long period of time and the morally right thing to do. So please, please approach me. I'd love to talk to all of you and work with all of you as much as I possibly can. Once again, my name's Elizabeth Waite, and I'm thank you for letting me speak. Thank you. Next speaker, please. I'm Mark Madeline, East Village resident in District two. I thank you guys for having this meeting tonight. Mayor and council. Members. I could go on and on, but I have. 3 minutes and I think I've ever done anything in 3 minutes. So I am here specifically to talk about the need and I know that you guys have addressed it about at-risk and homeless youth. I'm glad that she brought up college students, but not everybody is in college, so I am glad that she wants to focus on that. We're all focusing on different issues and it's great if I say anything tonight that might offend someone that's an adult homeless person. It's not meant to be. But I've had experience with people that I meet as president, Atlanta Democratic Club, and this one kid was 16 years old and was homeless from 16 to 19. He end up getting help in L.A., where he because they have a gay and lesbian center that has at risk homeless youth services. Prior to that, he was on the street from 16 to 18, basically staying warm. When people left Pismo Beach and the embers would. Be finished and he would leave his he would sleep there. But most of you guys know this story. The sad thing is, I've seen this over and over again, you know, every time I leave my home and these kids aren't in college. And I just. Know that it needs to be talked about. I'm not going to run it. You know, I'm not an expert in any of this. It's just something I see all the time. And I keep water in my car and I talk to them and they get excited that there's a meeting tonight. I ran to a kid today and. Unfortunately his girlfriend. Slit her throat while in the street because she just couldn't handle anymore. We can still save these. And again, no respect for people that are older, that are homeless. But you drive down Broadway and you'll see a kid that's hanging out with a group of people that are clearly in their disease, and we can still save them . They need a place to go that they can be safe. They need to. Stop couch surfing, sleeping around on apps, count, you know, getting diseases. These are our kids and I would be happy to work with you in any way. Again, it's about creating dialog. And you guys gave us that opportunity tonight and that's a real warning is just the chance to speak. And thank you so much. Thank you, Mark. Next speaker, please. Thank you, mayor and council members for all in the study session. My name is Dale Neal. And I am the chair of the Homeless Services Advisory Commission. Representing Councilperson or Councilwoman Pierce. I am on the Continuum of Care Board and have been employed by the Long Beach Rescue Mission for the last ten years. Additionally, I am the former director of the Winter Shelter Program under LBM and I am formerly homeless. Please know that what I share with you here are my thoughts and does not represent the aforementioned organizations or committees. I will open with. What you already know, how it is moving away from funding supportive services and moving towards funding just permanent housing. This is rightfully so. Supportive services, in a nutshell, is all about outreach and teaching people how to live again out here with you and everyone else. Rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing and all that is good. But for many who are living with mental illness, chronically homeless, and those with addictions. Housing just isn't enough. It can sometimes. Take months or years working with someone to build up them and their trust to get them to come in. And then we need them to stay housed. So the support services are crucial in helping this to happen. It is up to our state and local governments, along with the people, to increase and improve those supportive services. So I urge you now to. Move in that direction so we can do what we've done with veteran homelessness in our great city. And announced functional zero for all who are experiencing homelessness. And I close also with. Because it was brought up a lot about the difference in the ages of homelessness. When I first went to the rescue mission a little over 11 years ago, the average age was 35 and up. And now we see a lot of 18 and 19 year olds. It has changed dramatically. Homelessness is not just the old men anymore. So we need to do something. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you for your work. Next, before we go to the next speaker, we have actually a lady that's at the top. She's going to speak actually next and then. She will go to you. Good evening. Most esteemed representatives. I am a Long Beach resident and a senior citizen. Many seniors are on fixed incomes and are defenseless against increases in the cost of living, including. I realize that you've heard. This all before. Take into consideration that there are even. Speculators and onto. Your nerves. I have elderly parents and they would not wish to put them in jeopardy. Yet little or no consideration is given. Those of us who faithfully pay loyally our rent well ahead of prescriptions, food, insurance, and etc. would you consider your present renters, many of whom have been residents for years, qualified to be grandfathered in? Lots of us are in our late sixties plus with no support from their families who may be far away. Others are infirm or not able to seek help or can not seek solutions on their own. Basically, I ask that you propose your elderly. Not. Be subjected to cruel rent increases and addictions. Rent increases. Are like a slap in the. Face to those with honorable, well-lived lives who have raised their families and are now short. Timers. Affordable housing and. Waiting lists for seniors are too long, where many can die while waiting for hopefully and hopefully not become homeless as they do not deserve. The prices of homes have gone up so much. Where many seniors only receive Social Security, which is most in most cases is considered poverty level. We need your help. Seniors need a degree of dignity and safety. Cordially yours, Irene. Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker. Hello. My name is Jovana Ferraro, a business owner, resident downtown Long Beach. Thank you. Mayor Robert Kersee on council for having this discussion this evening. I just want to point out, first and foremost, the earlier conversation about. Weekends where there was areas where we couldn't. Connect people to resources. Also, the hotline idea of calling several different numbers. To potentially get. Someone to a resource which can be hard on weekends and late evenings on that especially is coming from the business side of the. Business owner side of me. We get that. A lot in our business association. And then on the lack of the connectivity sometimes among. Not just residents but especially. Or business owners to. Our. Folks experiencing homelessness and what we can offer them for assistance or and or any word of advice, especially in those late evenings and on weekends. What I want to say is. I really strongly urge. You to connect to people. Like me who are in the community, volunteering and really trying to spearhead something that we can do proactively to help. I'm looking at you guys because it's just. Three Shannon and on. But what we could really. Do to connect our business owners and residents that are really active in the community to be part of your cheerleaders out there. You need it. It's a very complex situation and we all know that. I'm urging you to get a hold of us and do the proper things that you think we need to know so that we can spearhead that education. There is a lack of education. You brought it up with people being bussed in. That is a myth by far. You don't see pictures of it, but people talk about it. Why? Because it doesn't exist. So what we need more is for you guys to really call people like Alison Crip and myself in who are not getting a paycheck from anyone to do this. We are strictly doing this based off our passion and we want your guidance and leadership to help you. So please continue to pull us in because you need cheerleaders out there. The community thinks the city is not doing anything. It's not that you're not doing anything. It's that you need help in what you're doing. Last, I'm going to leave with this. I'm so passionate about this, you guys. We developed a card to hand out homeless people, correct? It's got three, four resources on that card. I'm a. Fitness person. We have socks coming out that are called keep LPC fit and it has the resource card on it. The resource card is directly on this. This is to educate people who are not homeless about the services out there and to lend something which is very high a need which is socks. Winter is coming up to our homeless people. You buy a pair, we. Give a pair. Understood. Thank you. That's a great idea. You know that. Thank you for that. Next. Next speaker, please. I finally got my blessing to come up here because I have never do this a long time. I got to say hi to all the homeless people. That's all I'm concerned about. And you too. Oh, I can talk really fast, but. Wow, that's okay, sir. And put up the mike right up to you so. We can hear you. Thank you. First of all, this I've been I travel a lot, and I just love Grand Rapids. I was there six months doing the same thing. Oh, wow. I don't have a degree and none of this kind of stuff, but I got a degree in some other things that I do. First of all, homeless people is my number one passion. Well, I'm not doing this for me. I'm doing this for people that need something. Not the ones that don't want it. The ones that want it. I can't help the ones that don't want it. I'm not going to try to. I've been walking to Grand Rapids of Long Beach. I'm in Long Beach now for about six weeks. I can see the jobs out there for homeless people and it's called street cleaning, not the streets and the sidewalks. That's job creation that can people can do that. I do it. I do it for a place where I know I just got here. I'm getting paid to do that, too. So that's a that's a job that can be created to help people get at least get some better feeling for themselves. Oh, boy. Hmm. Okay, I. Was. I went to the homeless shelter when I first got here. And I did have some food that was not too good for my body. I looked at the date and it was like six weeks old. In Grand Rapids, I got something that was three years old. So you guys can figure that one out? Mm hmm. This is kind of interesting. Well, if you guys do give our housing to women here, I found that out throughout the places I've been going. You don't let the got the babies that go with them. That's breaking up the family as well. I know that for a fact. Oh, wow. I'm not nervous. I'm just very upset. That's what it is. I'm just very upset because of what I see here. I wasn't going to bring this up, but when I first got here, I had some problems with the police. I do this for a living. I your police force. Oh, my life is. This is what I do for my life. I'm not scared of nothing. No death and nothing. Because I got Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Rosa Park all in me. Okay. So I actually seen one of them one day and I ask them I had a black friend I had met on the street, but he was like really out of it. So I stopped one of them. I said, Can you help me? I'm trying to help this brother right here. Oh, yeah. They said, okay, yeah, we will go across the street. But guess what they did. They drove off. I'm done. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Thank you. My name is Margaret Merlo, and I'm here tonight to thank our studio, Long Beach, for all of the support to help homeless women and children. I grew up in. A small Italian village in Mexico. I speak Spanish and Italian. I became homeless after a very abusive marriage. The abuse started just months after marry him. He broke my nose, bruised my skin. In 2005, after many years of physical and emotional abuse, I found. Help at inter a house at this very special place. I found straight courage. My life change after finding help for myself and my three kids. I knew I want to help others. Today I am a domestic violence counselor. And educator at. Interval. House and my kids are. Become wonderful. Leaders. Also today they are working at INTER, has a second generation team program. To educate youth. Kids dating, violence and healthy relationship. I'm very proud to be part of this amazing program and I am honored. And it's an honor to. Me to help other homeless woman who. Are suffering, like I once said. Thank you very much. Thank you for all the support. I was. Homeless and now. I'm really, really proud. To find this amazing program. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And. And without counsel. Objection. I'm going to move down to 2 minutes. Most people have actually been only going to about 2 minutes. So just about an hour and a half of of of folks that want to speak. I want to make sure everyone gets a chance to speak. So what are the two minute timer? But again, I think almost everyone has hit it around 2 minutes. So please. My name is insurer and I am originally from Jordan. I'm here tonight to say thank you to city council, to all the city support, supporting and of house effort to address the specialized needs of the most underserved homeless victims of domestic violence in need of shelters like I once made it. I was in an abusive relationship for 16 years. My husband was very violent man verbally, emotionally and physically. He would throw his burning cigarets in my face every time he got upset. When my husband tried to burn the house with me and our five children inside of it. I had the courage to leave. I knew I had I had to leave. But at the same time, I knew I would receive a lot of blame from his. From him and his family. The police brought me to Animal House. Animal House was the only shelter that spoke my language. And just said. My culture. They helped me feel comfortable. I went through a lot of counseling, training. And for me and my children today, I'm the Middle Eastern program director at Interval House, and we have over 250 advocates involved in our Salam program, which means peace in Arabic. I'm so proud to be a part of the community helping to solve the issue of homeless homelessness. For each, for those who need most, need it the most like I was before. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Diana. I am. First of all, I have to say, I am very grateful to the city of Long Beach for your continued support in helping to solve the issues of homelessness. Especially for the abused. Women and children who have nowhere else to go other than shelters, of course, like in our house. My family came to the U.S. in 1975 to escape the violence and war in Vietnam with the hopes of building a new, safe and violent free life here in America, especially here in the Long Beach community. However, that didn't happen. The stress and struggles to make ends meet, like most families, has been brought on a lot of stress for both my father and my family. My father became very angry and controlling, which led to the physical, verbal and emotional abuse towards my mother. I was just five years old when my father attempted to stab and kill my mother right here in the driveway of our Long Beach home. Fortunately for us, our neighbor heard my mother screaming and crying for help, which she risked her life to save us and also was able to contact Long Beach Police Department to come and help us that night. If it wasn't for the local Long Beach Police Department here in Long Beach, we probably wouldn't be alive. And I probably wouldn't be standing here today because during that time, a lot of the shelters they call wouldn't take us. In because my mom. Could not speak English. She only spoke Vietnamese. So with the help of Miami's PD took us to a house. And today I am proud to work as a DB advocate and trainer, working with our many victims of all ages, including the young teens, adolescents, and working to make sure that they have a safe and stable housing, and also to make sure that we offer them all of the comprehensive supportive services in order for them to become self-sufficient. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Hi, Mr. Mayor. Mayor and council. Excuse me. Extremely nervous. This was very close to my heart. I was homeless for almost 13 years, seven of those years in Long Beach. I became homeless at 15 because my mom disowned me when I came out as lesbian. Continue to be homeless at the age of 29. So I experienced my teen years and my twenties living out of my car. Obviously the Department of Long Beach had you deal with me accordingly. Flipping my. Car is illegal. In Long Beach City. I did work a job. I had to sleep in my car, eat in my car, find somewhere to use the restroom in the morning and find somewhere to look like. I took a shower so I can have my job. Not a lot of places will let you use the bathroom. I know the community gets upset by homeless, defecating or urinating. Where else are they supposed to go? I currently have stomach problems from holding it for many years. Besides that, I did go through the resources through Long Beach City. Before. Excuse me. Erm. Multi-Service Center was redone before when it was. Beyond shelter. They actually got me off the street. They paid my first month's rent and half my second month's rent and my deposits for my utilities. It's extremely difficult to get housing when you have no rental history. You have no credit. You have horrible credit because you have long medical bills. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I have an extensive, horrible, crappy credit. I don't know how I was able to get an apartment. I'm currently have a place for five years and I'm on the verge of being homeless again. Besides that, you're asking about the vouchers. The hotel vouchers. I know my terms almost, but I'm sorry. I have to say this. Waiting 18 years to talk to you guys, the hotel vouchers. I don't know if it's changed since then, but back in the day it was Greenleaf and the one off Anaheim and Temple. Not the best neighborhoods in the world. Very drug ridden. I was not a drug addict and I did have a dog. I still have my service dog honor. When I was first 15 and homeless, I took a one way ticket to Maui. I figured I'd be warm and I could catch fish. As a teenager. It's extremely scary. You fear for being raped, your fear of being kidnaped. You fear of the sex trade. At 34 years old. I'm exhausted. I spent most of my life being homeless and surviving. Not only do you have to help these people get a home, they have to be integrated back into society. They've been ostracized. They've been judged. They've been treated inhumanely. It takes an effect on you for the rest of your life. And then you expect me to just go get a job, try for a weekend, to not take a shit, not take a shower and go get a job somewhere. The job economy sucks as it is. I never graduated high school. I'm on permanent disability, living off $889 a month. My rent's 875. I'm currently $500 short my rent this month. I have a homeless veteran with two brain tumors who's already had brain surgery, sleeping on my couch for three months. His voucher voucher is going to expire in six days. Where is he going to go? Where am I going to go? He's 64 years old and a veteran. My good friend, if I didn't give him a couch to stay on, where would he be? I had his studio when Rapid Rehousing got me. You know how many people live there? Nine. A veteran from Afghanistan. His wife. Her daughter, my friend. And her mother. I had bunk beds in my studio. I have a plan. It's almost exact. So the presentation that you gave tonight. Literally verbatim what you presented tonight that I've been preparing for 18 years. I have a huge plan and I could give you guys to help. I don't have enough time to explain what it is tonight. I'll email it to you if you'd like. It's long, but it would work. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. And well. And we're happy that we're happy. We'd love to see your plan and please make sure that we get copies of that. And the clerk will be happy to take if you want to leave your plan tonight or email us and we'll we're happy to take that. So thank you so much. Nick, thank you, sir, very much. Thank you, sir. Next speaker. I'm not going to say that this premier took. Yes. My name is Joe Myers. I'm a homeless veteran. I'm that way because my landlady. One of the ways around and my voucher would be wouldn't cover it so well was what you were saying about raising the voucher limit. Would would be would have been very helpful. But I'm too late for that. So what I do is I go to the housing authority and I agree, get this. But you get these things like rezoning, like for a one bedroom, you know, there's only one or two. There's four things on there. But you look at them every month, they're the same ones, the same addresses, the same people. They don't change them. You know, this housing authority, I don't know what they're doing would work, but it's a shame that they get. Six 2443 six 2622 same ones. I don't know what they're doing, but they're not they're not changing anything. I mean, that same repetition. The housing authority is now not being very helpful. Sir. Parliamentary say first of all, sir, thank you for your service to our country. And sir. First of all, thank you for your service to our country. Absolutely. And. We're going to we're going to have someone over here chat with you for a second to see if we can get you some some assistance. So, Mr. West, can you get somebody over here, please? So just can you just come over here? Okay. Thank you, sir. Just. Just come right down this way. Over here, sir. Alison King will take care of you. She's the director of our housing authority. Thank you, sir. Next. Next speaker. Thank you, Mr. Rivera, Counsel. I'm going to go through. This pretty fast. I have a bunch of notes here. It's going to sound like it's. Not homelessness, but it is, because I. See the bigger picture. So I want the council to recognize that the new development along Ocean has contributed to increasing rental prices for existing rental prices in the immediate area, which has had a ripple effect in the surrounding area. I recognize that some of the new development on Ocean Avenue that units are up to 33,000 a month, which is causing a ripple effect. Around the surrounding geographical area. Existing lower cost rental units, which has seen rental prices increase, has not simply seen improvements in existing rental units or rental. Property to justify rental price increases. Affordable housing needs to be an establish on all city council districts. Affordable housing needs to be in healthy urban surroundings, not along corridors that contain high levels. Of air pollution such as Cabrillo. Of affordable housing needs to have access to sources of healthy foods and financial services that are walkable distances. Affordable housing must be. Comfortably placed along. Transit services. City transit services needs to be needs. Community input, and must make. Medians available at. Times and locations which the public may attend. The meetings for the Community Transit Services needs to be in the early in the morning or evening, and I suggest once per quarter in. Evening for community input. Affordable housing also equals workforce development. The City of Long Beach needs to recognize that the career transition center is not adequately serving those who six services citizens of Long Beach should become displaced workers or less. Skilled workers. Seeking to improve their skills needs to rely on the. Career Transition Center to meet these needs. The Transition Center needs to create a strategic plan. To ensure citizens of Long Beach. Are ready to move forward to provide skilled workers in an economy that is becoming more green, more technology based and service oriented. New technology means new jobs. However, jobs, space and new technology does not mean existing skills will be used with new jobs. New technology means new computer programs means a learning curve for existing workers, a worker seeking to an end to enter a new technology workforce. He's going to wrap it up, sir. Oh, sorry about that. Okay. I actually emailed this to city clerk. Okay. So you guys can read it about. I want to hand it to her. Thanks. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Near Garcia City Council and our city staff. That was a good report. Thank you. I'm Arleen Mercer. And I'm active with three organizations here in Long Beach. First of all, I started Food Finders. I am the founder of Food Finders, the Monterey Regional Food Bank. And as most of you know, thank you very much, know that what we do there is try to take excess food to 300 nonprofit agencies where the food will be utilized instead of wasted. The second organization is Urban Community Outreach, and we're celebrating our 10th anniversary this year. Suzi Christ mentioned us. That's Uco for short. That's who urban community outreach is and was also mentioned. There are not enough services on the weekend and that's why we are open every Sunday from 1232 for its intake day. And about 300 people come to us every Sunday because we make hot, nutritious meals that they like. Well, that's a good way to draw them in. I filled their stomach, but then we try to work with them to lift them out of the poverty and the homelessness. 75% of the people who come to us are homeless, and we have families, individuals, seniors, veterans, everyone. Well, how do we help them and how do we work with them? We interview them one on one. Those who are ready to talk to see about a way that they could rise out of their condition. And then we. Work with them, we help them set goals, and then we help them with the steps it will take to reach those goals. And most times, our goal is to be, you know, in a nice, stable condition and in a home. So we help them with our computer lab building job skills, and we help them with free childcare with our partner agencies. We partner with a lot of agencies in Long Beach. When they have free childcare, they can work. When they have a resume, they can go out and look for that job with transportation also so they can get to interviews. We help them with motel vouchers, very coveted motel vouchers. If they are working with us and trying to improve their life, we will give the families motel vouchers. Absolutely. We're very proud to announce another thing, if I may. Yes, you. Can. Absolutely you can. There is another need in Long Beach that's been mentioned tonight. We have doctors and nurses now that come and address their medical issues, but mental health issues and addictions, we knew were much more attention needed in those areas. So we have just been. Awarded Samsung Grant a federal grant. That means there will be three more outreach workers hired. They will be able to see psychiatrists which will come through our partner less inaccurate clinic. They also will be with our other partner for a 90 day bridge program for addictions. And then beyond that, Housing Authority has awarded us 25 vouchers annually. And if we can just work successfully now with the landlords to get them into permanent housing. So we all need to work together the only way we're going to help the folks that need us. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for your work. Next speaker, please. Thank you. Counsel Thank you for having me. My name is Alison Crisp. First of all, I want to say thank you to those in our audience that are struggling with homelessness. And any other issues. I've never been. Homeless. I am a volunteer with our community. Like many of us know, I also want to say really quick, I'm also here representing my friend Josh, who is definitely here with us in spirit. He would be here as a very dedicated soldier for this issue as well. So thank you. Those that are here. It's brave for you guys to share your stories on a regular basis with just us that are learning about that have never gone what you've gone through. And that's what I've done. Like what Joe mentioned, I'm not paid to do this. I represent Beacon for him right now and many other organizations that I've learned so much from. Thank you so much, everybody. Lucy Hayes in the audience and Candace Face, Maya. And everybody that has allowed me to be on their. Journey. I won't talk too much. Just have a minute. I'm here representing Beacon for him. And a lot of the things the other night we have, which is 439 Anaheim Street food, if you're on if anybody needs food, come there on Mondays. We have lots of food. And just like a Yuko, like First Congregational, I asked them questions last Monday. I think a lot of the questions, a lot of the answers for some of our residents are our clients that were there is is we need more showers. We need help with Section eight housing. A couple of the ones that really stood out to me were that we need rides. And I know that Councilman Pierce mentioned this. I was ready if we can all work together in all these organizations to get rides. I worked personally with one person just at my very beginning stages of this whole thing and helped her go from housing authority to Multi-Service Center to different places where she needed to get her storage, which is all the way from Bixby Knolls. That would be great, and I don't know how we could do it, but that's just my biggest suggestion. I appreciate you guys. Also a big, big proponent, the LGBTQ, LGBTQ community, for those that are suffering, if not suffering that are trans, where they can use the restrooms and how they can sleep. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening, honorable mayor, city, city official and all council member. My name is Kyle Song and I'm an active member of the Cambodian community. I'd like to thank all of you for allowing me to be a part of this discussion and also like to thanks, folks. Many of you who are homeless and are here this evening to share your story. Now, it was a few months ago that I had an opportunity to attend the meeting with. The first councilman for district. Councilman Supernova that when I realized that homelessness is a serious, serious issue, ladies and gentlemen, homelessness in a central area are on the rise. Among those population are the elderly Cambodians. That. That was since before. And I want to make it short. I want to thank Mayor Garcia, who calls upon me, asking me to be here. And I'm glad that I did. So tonight, I offer my help. Theresa, you can have my call, and I will call you. Or you could call me. My phone number is 562444506989. Call me anytime. Thank you. Thank you, Charles. Next speaker, please. My name is Stefan Dawson. So I am a second district resident. The problem of homelessness is actually kind of a rather simple one if you're looking at the original causes. One is a lack of affordable housing caused by speculative real estate market, especially within the downtown area, prompted by a overdevelopment of high rise, very expensive condos. And the second cause of it, of course, is that we're gonna be looking at as a statutory one. We have a lack of a form of affirmative rights for the homeless. What I mean by this is that they are presently existing within the municipal code for Long Beach, several completely on constitutional provisions that deprive homeless people of their First Amendment rights in terms of of criminalizing their ability to solicit donations. Their Fifth Amendment rights. The random, the random and completely unjustifiable gathering up of their belongings and the destruction thereof. And again, another first memory with their ability to sleep within certain certain areas. All of these are presently within the invisible code and are enforced on a daily basis in a discriminatory manner against the homeless. This is not a idle problem. The city of Los Angeles has been sued on three successive occasions, going up to the Supreme Court and being and being affirmed by the Ninth Circuit. Ninth Circuit, 11 versus the City of L.A. Jones versus city a city of L.A. and Desert Train versus the city of L.A.. All those are active cases and will be used as precedent against us. One of these days, if we maintain these laws, the second the second issue of affordable housing is one that we are all very well aware of, but again, is not being properly supported. This will cause people this will cause Long Beach to be a less diverse place, both racially and in terms of our economic ability and will lead to more deaths. What I mean by that is ask our fire department about how many converted houses and that they're finding out now who they're discovering on a daily basis. How many people, as our friends discussed earlier, are living in nine or ten people within a studio apartment or in a back house? This is not habitable conditions, and this can be fixed by affirmative legislation, by this by the council. They can never get to. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the city council. My name is Craig. Cogen with the DBA, and I want to thank the mayor and the City Council for placing this item on the agenda for an open discussion. I also like to thank Kelly and Theresa for their excellent presentation, as well as all the community partners who have engaged and. Participating in addressing this issue. I certainly want to express my. Thanks to our organization, its leadership, and individuals such as Steve Picard, our community. Outreach manager. Who works diligently with different organizations and community outreach and working with addressing the homelessness. Antoinette Hamilton and Steve Branch, who work as homeless outreach specialists seven. Days a week. We also have. A great group of volunteers as you met Gio and certainly Alisyn. Tonight, and Michelle Molina, who. Have have really dedicated themselves and. Committed their efforts towards addressing this issue with their public safety and certainly the quality of life. This is the the elephant in the room that people don't like to talk about. And the face of homelessness does not have an age, does not have a race, does not have a gender. And it's about time that. We have this. Open discussion to discuss. Exactly how we're going to address it. I believe our. Organization will continue to engage. To educate, to inform. And inspire others. And you ask for volunteers and you ask for our commitment. We we are committed to continue our efforts to bring you our resources and collaborate on an ongoing basis. So whatever you need, our organization's there to help. Thank you very much. Thank you, Craig. And thank you to all the debate team mates here for their all their work on this as well. Next speaker, please. Hi. I'm Dr. Lisa Nicholas. I'm a pediatrician and the CEO of the Children's Clinic serving children and their families. I want to thank you very much, Mayor and Council, for bringing this issue. Kelly and Theresa. Superb presentation. We are very. Very proud to and honored to be working with the city and the century villages of Cabrillo and the Multi-Service Center to provide health. Care to the homeless. We also see thousands and thousands of patients, 40,000 patients in total of low income families. In our clinics. We have hundreds of families that are. Homeless but also that are on the edge of homeless. And many times. They are crowded, living in apartments, in studios, in garages, and they're victims of domestic violence. But they can't. Leave because they cannot get housing. Our social workers work diligently. And we appreciate all the help and all that you're doing and we're here to partner with. You. I think we don't realize how many of the homeless are young women with children many times who are a victim of violence. And we had recently. A six month. Old that was living with her parents. Their car was. Totaled so. They couldn't live in their car. And they were living on the street. And if we want our children to be successful and not and to graduate. From school and to have successful lives. We have to help them with homelessness. We have to help them with food insecurity. We have. To address the violence that has occurred in the parents. Lives in the past, help them deal with that and help our children really succeed. So we are here to partner with you. I thank you. And we'll do whatever we can. And our partnerships with the. Housing folks in town, we have a site at century villages of Cabrillo and are. In the multi-service center. And we want to continue. That kind of work and. We need quality housing for our families. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And council people. Uh, Lena, I am. My name is Ansar Rock, and I live in the first district. I am here to ask you what you are planning to do. When you close Lincoln Park. What is your strategy in getting these people help? How are you going to redirect them? And what area and how are you going to help them out? Second, I want to tell you that the people we come in contact that we have problems with in the first District that affect us are the mentally ill and the drug. Addicts, for instance, we find needles in our park and kids. Cannot play until we really clean them. Second. We have these people that are mentally ill, are unapproachable, some of them are violent, and some of them, you know, we cannot go up to them and try to help them. Also, I'd like to know how many quality of life officers you have. For our our city, because I have been in a situation where I had called and they told me at the police department that until they. Finished taking care of. All the emergencies, they couldn't come down. And so we waited 20 minutes and no one ever showed up. So I'm wondering if those quality of life officers. Have been increased for our area or for the city? As a matter of fact. Thank you. Thank you. What we'll do is I know we'll make sure we get you the information. And some of that was I know we went over it in the presentation, but there's a lot more that we can get you. So we'll make sure we connect you with the exact plan, particularly for Linkin Park and around that. So maybe Councilman Gonzales can send that over. Yes. And we'll have Corey connect with you. We're working on a meeting actually with Geo, our neighbor here. So we'll connect you with that. Next week or please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Gary Sheldon's my name is one block north of where I'm standing right now. And so it's a pleasure to greet you all this evening and a little bit of my own creds. People have been giving their credit this evening. I served for two terms as the chairman of the Homeless Services Advisory Commission back in my day, and I also sat with my sister, Janet Rhodes, as we tried to figure out how to phrase and how to how to put together. The drop in center at First Congregational Church has been mentioned several times. She was the founder of it. She lives in Atlanta, Georgia, right now. Janet Rhoads The two years that I spend on Homeless Services Advisory Commission were like beating my head against the wall of the dais here. Frankly, we had a completely different council back then. We had a different mayor. We had a mayor at one time who would walk out of the room whenever homelessness was being discussed back behind the rail there. I want to praise Mayor Garcia once more in public, like I've done any number of times. You're the first Mayor, Robert, in memory who has even mentioned poverty or homelessness in all of your speeches, your inaugural speech, your wonder days, your one year, year to year. We really, really support you on that. And I believe that that's why we're here right now. I wanted to direct thank you. I wanted to direct your attention to two things that the council has in its purview that it can fix is get their development services people to actually comply with SB two, which is the by right placement of homeless shelters, which right now does not comply with the state law. The same thing with the placement of SRO housing, which for the first time in anybody's memory, we have an ordinance for SRO housing and I just want to leave it. The reason they don't comply is there's no available as our OSE or or SB two sightings. They're not adequate and they're not accessible. So those are the things that you can do. And I want to say that you have us, the members of the public, we have your back on this thing, forge forward with it, and you've got the power to make it happen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your work. Your next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and councilmembers. My name is Paul Collins. I'm an architect over in the West Side and the chairman of the West PAC here. I'm mostly representing myself tonight as an architect. I'd be glad to donate some of my architectural services and get together with some other architects. Long Beach has a lot of really fine architectural firms, and architects are expensive, and I donate some time to work with the homeless center if they come up with projects where they can improve existing buildings. Because most of my work is improving existing buildings or industry, but I work on a lot of housing projects as well, and I'd be glad to donate some of my time to help them and find some other architects that we could work together and possibly get some contractors and some developers to kick in some free services too, because all this cost a lot of money and I want to give back to my community. I grew up in Long Beach, so I'd love to help out homeless people. I was lucky enough to grow up in Eldorado Park Estates, which is one of the gems of the city. And now I work in the West Side, which is the money driver, the city, and has some serious homeless problems. The problems we have in the West Side are mostly the mentally ill and the drug abuse and homeless people. And it's a very serious problem for the industrial businesses because at night we leave most, most of the business. So those aren't 24 hours. And in our neighborhoods, we have a serious problem with RV's that have people in living in them that are mentally ill. And we and they know the laws very well and they they park for three days and then they move. And they've been creating serious problems for businesses there. And we need some real help with these people because they don't really want to help. They want to just be left alone. But they are causing a lot of serious problems. We've we've sent letters, Darlene, and I'm sure she'll share all that information with you. And I think they're the hardest part of the homeless problem is the people that have mental illnesses and drug and alcohol problems, because a lot of them don't want help or they don't know how to get it or how to use it. And it's just like every other population in our whole society, 95% of us are great people and there's 5% that caused the problem that make a lot of people hate that whole group. And it's really sad because most homeless people aren't there by choice, but they're there by some really bad circumstances and we need to help them out. But we also need to protect the businesses that are driving the city and we need to protect the homeless of Long Beach as well. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Next speaker. Please. Good evening, Council Mayor. My name is Yeji Kayla Watts. I've been a Long Beach resident almost on and off for ten years. I'm a full time behavior therapist and also the founder of Hearts Zoo Development. But I'm also a single mother struggling paycheck to paycheck, trying to raise my daughter in a safe and crime free city. In the past, I have houses for homeless children under the age of six. While their father. Transitioned from prison and their mother. Battled addiction. I have housed a young woman battling drug induced schizophrenia. Held the hand of a man. I named Mr. Butler, who died. Without dignity, sleeping in a public park. I've laughed and I've. Cried. With a disabled veteran who was killed. In broad daylight over. A bottle of vodka. I have watched a chronically ill elderly man left to die without. A name and all of these cases. They suffered from mental illness. Homelessness is. Now personal to me. And we have to do more. I am very thankful for tonight to learn and to observe and to see where we are in terms of. Tackling this issue of homelessness. Homelessness. Though some progress has been made, particularly with veterans, I would like to see the city. Prioritize the rest of the homeless population. And those at risk with its. Unbalanced budgets. While hundreds of millions of dollars. Are being invested into infrastructure. The city should not have to rely on nonprofit. And private organizations to meet basic. Human needs. We need to address this multifaceted issue. Yes, we need bleeding heart organizations, but what we need more. Are tangible. Solutions. Providing food and shelter is necessary, but it is also a reactive strategy to a. Problem that needs to be addressed. Proactively. I would love this city. My city. To pride itself not only on its diversity, but in prioritizing its people. Over its profit. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Thank you. Council and mayor. My name is Nicole Reese. I work for a local arts nonprofit that we address social issues in Long Beach, using art as a vehicle for awareness and solution. Now, when I moved to language, it was entirely because of the art scene. Council members I've witnessed how you were always there to cheer on Long Beach artists. You are different from other council members in other cities because you actively support the arts. And living in Long Beach makes me grateful for that special reason. We're here tonight to speak on the city's ten year plan of homelessness. You will agree that homelessness is a larger problem than just providing housing and as much greater costs. These costs appear in the cleanups in the 47% spent on law enforcement and the 2.4 million spent on the New South Police Division numbers released in your newest budget. These are necessary programs. I'm glad. That you're prioritizing. Public safety, and I appreciate our quality of life officers. But I believe by favoring civic authority, you are overlooking public connection. Consider the extensive efforts of activate uptown development of areas like the pike and beautification of downtown infrastructure. These otherwise amazing projects could make it unaffordable for residents to continue living in those neighborhoods. These projects imply that money is being spent installing murals onto walls, then installing people's and people into homes. Long Beach would like you to spend more time thinking about the fact that many of your artists and students are struggling to pay rent , CouchSurfing or even homeless. A lot of what makes the city beautiful comes from the people who can't afford to live here. Displacement is pushing more residents onto the streets, and measures in place to stop this are painfully few. The systemic issues that cause displacement exist in the policy world. Renters rights, inclusionary zoning, lawful eviction and a number of affordable housing units that accurately reflects the number of people in need. These are basic protections. Right now, gentrification is eating away at their ability to live in Long Beach without living in fear. You will lose the diversity and you will lose Long Beach along with it. A support program for those who are suffering in, on the brink of or recovering from homelessness could appear as an artistic junction if housing organizations exchanged board. And health services for the empowered. Labor of its low income residents. Thank you. Guys. Wrap it up. Go ahead. Educate a user, renovate and activate the buildings. Then a low income housing building and other shelters could be an improvement. In a neighborhood, not an incubator, an incubator for perpetuated homelessness. And I'm willing to commit to creating this resource. Thank you so much. Thank you. And I'm going to. I know we still have a lot of folks that are in line and some that are not in line to speak still. So I want to make sure we just try to take the 2 minutes. I know it's hard to appreciate everyone's patience. Good evening, Mayor. City Council staff. My name is Brian D'Andrea. I'm with Century Housing. I'm also on the continuum of care board here locally and sit on the Mayor's Study Group for affordable housing and workforce housing. Thank you for convening Tonight Session. It's been a really incredible dialog. I've learned a lot centuries of the nonprofit manager, developer and steward of the villages that Cabrillo, together with a number of other wonderful organizations out in West Long Beach. We've been a long time partner of the city in addressing the needs of our homeless. Clearly, the needs are great. The issue of homelessness has become more visible and has really captured the public's attention, and rightfully so. Many of us in this room have been working on this issue for many, many years. And as has as has been shared tonight, the city has achieved a number of really remarkable successes over the years , to name just a few, a reduction of unsheltered homelessness between the last two homeless counts, achieving UFA status for a continuum of care, being on the cusp of ending veteran homelessness, new permanent supportive housing developments like Anchor Place and others to name just a few. Those successes don't happen on their own. They require leadership, diligence and compassion on the part of city staff, elected officials and the community. I want to take a moment to highlight a couple of conditions which I think have contributed to the successes. First, this commitment tonight session is a really great testimony to local commitment, both within the public and private sector to addressing the needs of our homeless. We also benefit from strong citizen leadership on boards like the Homeless Services Advisory Committee and the Continuum of Care Coordination. We have a highly coordinated system with our own health department, a dedicated multi-service center control. We also have a dedicated continuum of care funding. Unlike LaSalle, which services 85 different cities throughout Southern California, we have our own continuum of care, funding and concentration. The city has really dedicated resources in a number of key ways that have led to economies of scale and strong linkages. I encourage everyone to please think about this issue as as really being as homeless, as being a symptom and not being the direct problem. The problem is a deeper human problem. And to solve that problem, we really need to think about investing in the support of services needing to it needed to address the symptom. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Vincent to Mia. Thank you, Mayor, for hosting this. Amazing Pandora's box that you've opened. Briefly just to state in a sentence why I appreciate what you do. My father was an assistant city clerk for 30 years in Columbus, Ohio. That should tell you everything about me. About me personally. I've been working in homeless ministry for 30 years. I've lived in L.A. for 21 years. I've lived in Long Beach for nine years with my wife. We're both business owners. We are a. Florist. We had a business on. Broadway and a Bespoke for two years where we dealt with a lot of interfacing with homeless people. I have personally never spent less than an hour with every homeless person I've ever encountered. I'm not trying to pat myself. On the back. I'm trying to tell you that I have a wealth of information and I'm begging. You to provide. Make a provision. For more of what you're hearing here tonight. What's missing for me are resources. I said for years. For decades. We need a multi-service center. Thank God we have one. How long did that take? You know, and our our police are so. Understaffed with what I have. Experienced with the police department, is what I was told by an officer who I won't. Mention by name in my district too. I live in downtown core on Linden. Between Broadway and East Third that there is the letter of the law in the spirit of the law. I have an issue with that. Which is it? I understand we're working on a bare bones, but the quality of life does not. Just apply to. Homeless people. It applies. To the residents who live here and the businesses who are operating here, who are being affected. By the homelessness. I feel sorry for developers, but I also feel sorry for residents. Because the city is not holding landlords, slumlords and property management companies to accountability. How many years has this city council been told. That there are. Substandard conditions in living? You want to talk about prevention? Kelly I applaud your report. Teresa, I welcome you long awaited. But seriously, we need resources. Because we don't have them. We don't have because we don't have an actual building. The the MHRA wanted a building. Over off of Anaheim. I think it was this multistory unit that they had and then it was taken away from them. It belongs to a family in Texas. It's sitting there empty. I hear we need resources. So here's my few solutions for you right now. We've got to make it. We've got to make rent control. I mean, give. You just five. Rent control. Quickly, though. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. How about some public restrooms? Nobody's mentioned it. How about some case? Watch a community case. Watch where we can all log into a central. Location and talk about here is this homeless person that we've been dealing with for five, ten, 20 years. We already know their story. We already helped them. This is why nothing's happening with them. You have it in case watch in social services. Why don't you have it at a community level? And lastly, I would just say. Please, for God's sakes, would you make a mandate for locking dumpsters and recycle bins? Please. Especially in the downtown core businesses, it should be mandated. That locking dumpsters and locking recycle bins, those recycle bins, it's a misdemeanor if you steal out of them. Yet we're enabling our homeless people by providing them a place where they can come and get recyclables and cash it in for alcohol. I mean, come on. Thank you, sir. Next speaker. And just as I'm going to have to I know I've been a little I'm trying to be flexible with the time. But again, we have still probably an hour of public comment. And so I want to make sure that just the 2 minutes we'll try to keep the flow as best possible. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, members of the council. Thank you for having this session tonight. My name is Suni Lee Chang. I'm executive vice president at Link Housing. We are an affordable. Housing developer based here in Long Beach, just five blocks. Away. And we build housing statewide. We've built 7500 units over our 32 year existence, and we also build permanent supportive housing. What that means is we build housing for the homeless with permanent wraparound services. And that is. If we talk about solutions to this problem, long term solutions that can be multiplied over years. That's what we're talking about. And as we've heard through personal stories and through statistics tonight, this is a tremendous challenge. We are all facing. And it requires. Us all to be creative. And. Resourceful. And so I will. Talk a little bit about that. We have a project that we've partnered with the city on with before in the fourth District. It's the Palace Hotel. It provides 14 units for transitional age youth who youth who are homeless. There are ways. That we could continue to do this. We heard the vice mayor talk about motels. There's a possibility. Of converting those into permanent units where you could use. Permanent vouchers, not just hotel vouchers. There is the ability to leverage additional resources that are available. The state has just passed a bill that authorizes $2 billion for homelessness. 350 million of that is coming to Los Angeles County. It's called No Place Like Home. The Department of Health Services at the county will help provide wraparound services. We heard questions about that. And really, I think a big part of thinking about the solution is it truly does require a collaborative effort. Who benefits from this? Aside from the individuals, it's really thinking about financially. Who can you get to the table to help pay for this? Right. Hospitals benefit, the city benefits fire police. What could. Happen if you could start. Pulling everybody together and thinking about this collaboratively. Could you put dollars in? Could you use public safety dollars? It's something to really consider. And link housing is here and we're ready to help. Thanks. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Thank you. Mayor. And thank you, city council for having this forum. My name is Eric. Crowe, and I live in Alamitos Bay, part of Long Beach by the park pantry. The one thing that I feel from this. Meeting more than anything else. Two things, actually, is a. Sense of hope. And I feel humbled. I had no idea that all of this was being done around me. And I'm so grateful that I came here tonight to this meeting. I'm so grateful you invited me. I've been pretty much in just about every at risk group that. There has been in tonight, whether from substance abuse, from domestic violence. Being on a fixed income. And living in an SRO, although in another city. And so I heard my I heard. My story so many times. And I wanted to also say I wanted to also say how glad. I was to hear LGBTQ. Issues mentioned. And in particular, what's become what I think is my calling is homeless, homeless, high school and college students. I think a. Lot of people read the same article about the Cal State student that was a. Graduate, that was a candidate for a Ph.D. that was living out of his car. And. That was that that that really touched me as a as a person who's about to graduate. With a B with a degree in social and behavioral sciences. That is very much the place that I want to direct my energies. And I think that I'm in the right place to do it. And what I think I want more than anything else is a direction. So I say to the people that. That put together this beautiful report tonight, point me in that direction. I'm ready to go. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Dr. Garcia, members of the city council. My name is Dave Pilon. I'm the president and CEO of Mental Health America of Los Angeles. I want to echo the prior speaker. I feel a great sense of hope tonight as well, not only because of the great presentation that Kelly and Teresa did, but just the the way that you're addressing this issue creates a lot of hope in me having been involved in these kinds of discussions for the better part of two decades. I have to tell you that the compassion and sensitivity that you're addressing this issue with is very impressive, and you're all to be commended for that. And I appreciate that, that aspect of this. I want to just use the remainder of my limited time just to address some of the issues that were brought up tonight. First of all, tomorrow, Mr. Anthony. Sorry, Anthony Rendon, the speaker of the California Assembly Assembly, is coming to my MHC Village program over at 15. An album he authored the No Place Like Home Bill that's going to create about $2 billion in support of housing here in the state of California. And he's coming because he wants to know sort of like what are the supportive services that should be offered, the wraparound to those kinds of those kinds of housing. And Councilmember Pierce, you were asking, you know, what what about wraparound for other sorts of housing as well? You know, there are some funds available. The County of Los Angeles funds my program to provide services to people with severe and persistent mental illnesses. We cannot find enough housing for them, but we would be happy to provide the wraparound services for the folks living in those in those housing units kind of thing. So if you can create the housing, we can provide the services at least to some parts of that. Councilmember Price, you also asked about the lack of substance use services. There is absolutely a dearth of those services. And but the good news is on the horizon is that CMS has given California a waiver to increase Medi-Cal drug services. And so effective probably July 1st of next year, there will be many more services for substance use disorders available to the low income population. My own agency will be providing those services. I know nine months is a long time to wait, but there is help on the horizon with that. I'm sorry, that's all the time. But thank you so much for all. You know, M.J., as you guys know, as you know, it is amazing work. So I know that we're continuing to partner on the facility as well that were building in central Long Beach. So. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Please. Hi, my name is Steven Leary. I'm also involved with urban community outreach. As I mentioned earlier, I volunteer for the drop in center downtown at Uco and I've actually lived in Long Beach since 2008 and have seen the homeless situation through many of its ups and downs. I have been volunteering for over a year and have made it my personal mission to develop countless community partners and involve city council in the mix from the start. And in doing this, my focus was always on the good things my organization was doing and others like it to deal with the homeless problem in our city. This involves not just feeding the homeless, but providing services to get them off the streets and on to a more productive life. Talking about city council. I personally want to thank both Ginny Pierce, who the minute I mentioned the situation about the homeless to her, she had organized a day of service for the homeless immediately. And of course, Susie Price. Susie Price. Susie Price. What I would also like to do now is, again, thank both of you for making your part of your agenda from the very beginning. Now, I was recently at one of Susie's community meetings, and I was actually a little upset about the way I thought that that that Susie was being was being treated in the meeting. I think people need to realize that Susie and many. Others like her are trying to be part of the solution. Even though we still have a long way to go. We're headed in the right direction. The problem is not going to go away overnight. A year or so ago, there weren't all these intense community meetings or talks of study sessions, so we are headed in the right direction. One thing I did find very disturbing at Susie's meetings was the public's. Lack of compassion I. Felt for the homeless. No one chooses to be homeless, and these are good people who deserve our compassion. Long Beach is a compassionate city that cares about its own. Proven by the fact that we are already, I believe, right in the midst of Long Beach serves right now and with Long Beach serves. Obviously the whole point of that encouraging volunteerism. We've got to wrap it up. Uh huh, yeah. Okay. Now, imagine if we had never had compassion for the. For the LGBT community. I can't even imagine that we couldn't have done that. And they've become a very vibrant part of our city. And imagine if we hadn't opened our arms to them. I have to wrap it up. So it's okay. It's okay. Oh, I just I just want just one last thing. It's just that, you know, I think many volunteer based organizations are really trying to be involved in the solution. So, as you say, it's really all about community partners and all of us working together. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Great job. Next speaker. Good evening. Good evening, mayor garcia and city. So city council members. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank you very much for. Always having homeless. Homelessness as one of your priority. And we really appreciate that. And we have not seen that for a very long time. So thank you. Thank you so much. And to essentially. Thank you so much for. Having such an amazing presentation. I think had a lot of information and I think it was something. Very good for people to see. And to hear about. So thank you for that. My name is Cassandra Lab. I've been involved with Interior House for over 20 years and today I'm the operations director in Denver. House upon his daughter 37 years ago and has constantly been delivering culturally competent level of service to the homeless family. With the support of our city and with our involvement with the continuum of care, we have been able to evolve from a small domestic violence shelter. Which operated from the garage of the home into the. Award winning domestic violence program that we are today providing emergency shelter. Transitional center. And rapid. Rehousing to thousands of people who are. Homeless. Over the years into the House has served. As a bridge to new life for thousands of families in crisis who turned to us during the time of greatest needs into our houses. Provided safe shelter. Rapid rehousing and comprehensive wraparound services to ensure that the most vulnerable in our community. Are provided with the support they need to stay off the street and open permanent housing. Because of this city, successful efforts to prevent and end homelessness and to work. With the continuum of care. Agencies such as Interval House. Many individuals I found housing and dramatically turn the situation around. This number is increasing tremendously, but I want to share with everyone that all the efforts that have been made over the years are effective. And we are proud of and we are a proof of it because we are serving many. Many, many homeless and able. To offer them housing today. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Hi. My name is Melissa Sanchez. I'm kind of short. Sorry. Thank you for holding this meeting. I actually came. Just to talk about something that's currently going on. In the apartment complex that I live in. And I don't know if any of you have children. I have an autistic eight year old, and she has a really beautiful smile. And she couldn't talk until she was four. And I have a seven. Year old and an 11 month old with the. Most beautiful eyes and a. He's very sweet, but we're looking. About we're about to be. Homeless. Again. It's been five years. I've lived in my apartment complex and I reported the property management for bedbugs and and. You know, like to housing. To the housing department. Like I'm supposed to. Right. Because they made me the manager, and now they're trying to give me a three day notice. And I don't. Know if any of. You have ever. Took your kids in at night. Right. And you get. That good feeling because, you know, they're safe and. Have you ever put a blanket over them in your. Car after they asked you where we're going to sleep? While you're sleeping in a white residential neighborhood because you don't want them to. Be attacked and you have a hammer. In your front seat because you're afraid somebody might try to. Do something to children. It's not a good feeling. And I'm sticking up for the other. Five or six tenants that they're trying to kick out. Giving 30 day notices because they want to fix the places up and increase the rent. And maybe. What I say doesn't make a. Difference. But my kids have played with their kids for five years and. They're like best friends with a lot of the kids in the neighborhood. And I've just been really upset. My my brother's homeless right now, and we don't have a lot of help. You know, and I know that there's nonprofits that can help. Pay for funding for buildings. For therapists, for all of that. If you guys. Would actually just look into it and if you need more information for me, because I. Do know some places. You can call me 5626163983. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Next speaker, please. Rex Goodyear. Hi, I'm Karen Reside. Thank you, everybody, for having this opportunity. This is amazing and amazing discussion. Tonight, I come as being involved in the Homeless Advisory Commission with Gary Shelton in the early days when we were working on this problem and two years ago I became homeless myself, my boyfriend decided to end the relationship by locking me out of the apartment at 1230 on a Saturday night. And there's just a couple of points I really wanted to make tonight is if I knew a lot about homeless services, was embarrassed and ashamed to seek out the help that I needed. It took me three days to get over the shock and realize that I was homeless. How is it for a people that have mental issues and drug issues? How can we help to help to house them? And I ran a program at Second Samoan Congregational Church where we fed and provided services to the homeless. The homeless create their own community because we are ostracized. This you don't know what it's like to be homeless until you have to bathe in a sink and. I can't couldn't talk and tell my friends this because I was afraid of their reaction. I was lucky I had people that allowed me to couch surf in their homes and places where I could stay that were safe. So we need to preserve those communities. And when we look at doing providing services for them, that's what I see is the big gap, because they're living outside of the norms. They still have to have support and they lean on each other. And I don't know. And I had to call a person's father and tell him that he had OD'd and something I never, ever want to see anybody have to do. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Sharon. We with a real house again. And I wanted to really think Kelly and Teresa for so eloquently educating all of us about what is really happening with homelessness in our city. And I also wanted to thank our mayor and Councilmember Price for really engaging important dialog in our communities near where our shelters and walking centers are located. And we at the past chair of the Lobby S.O.S.. I know that our Long Beach Continuum of Care and our Multi-Service Center, we've really coordinated very innovative efforts that have successfully addressed issues of homelessness. But clearly, we have a lot more work to do. There are new emerging needs and issues and diverse challenges that are facing our homeless population today that is different than in the past. And so we really appreciate the opportunity for us to have these important dialogs and to ask how do we have a thriving city as well as take care of those that have nowhere else to go? And I do believe that with our brilliant city leaders, community service providers are engaged community citizens that are concerned about these needs that we can come up with something that really works. And we at Interval House, we see every day homeless these women and children that don't have anywhere to go. And we feel honored and we're committed to working together with everyone to really come up with these solutions and try to prevent and make sure that we have less homeless individuals and families on the streets in our city . So thank you very much. Thank you. In just a moment, we have an individual up top. So, Mr. Rockwell, you want to go ahead and give your 2 minutes? Thank you. I have a friend that has been homeless since January. The reason for her being homeless is not because of the fact that she and her husband can't pay rent. They lived in their apartment for 39 years before being evicted. They were evicted because a new owner bought the place and needed to be redone and the city code would not allow them to stay there. And the part meant that they had. They've been living in a motel ever since because she is in a wheelchair and they haven't been able to find any place that is suitable for them to live because there are no accessible housing units to be had in the city, not at any price unless you can pay over $5,000 a month. They were paying approximately 2000 or less, less than 2000 a month for their place. But now they're having to stay in a motel where they have no kitchen, one bed and not very comfortable. And that's by the time they pay their motel. Food, eating out and all the rest of it that is costing them almost $10,000 a month. This is ridiculous. We do not have proper, accessible housing and necessary and they are homeless even though they are in a motel. They are still homeless. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Patrick Watson, fourth district. Homelessness is a tragic situation that affects a lot of people. And I think all the citizens of Long Beach try to be compassionate. With that said, there is a big gap between people that are homeless, disabled, in need of mental care and those that due to Prop 47 that are repetitive thieves , drug users and going out and taking advantage of community. Our police force is underpaid, understaffed. Morale is down. People are leaving. The city doesn't have the money to pay the police force. I was told by one police officer there, one officer in the entire department, one that's tasked with tracking the homeless criminals that are repeat offenders, sexual predators, thieves, drug users. One for the whole city. I think the city you know, city people here, the councilman and the mayor owe it to the people that pay the taxes, bring the money into the city, that help pay for these programs to protect their homes. I don't think Janine or Suzy want people defecating in their yard. And I'm sure if it was happening in their front yard and their stuff was being stolen, they would have police all over the place. Mr. Super and I live in his neighborhood and it hasn't really been a big issue for him either. But crime has gone up astronomically in our neighborhood. We have a ride away between the freeway and Knoxville Avenue where the homeless are living, and they're coming out every night. My wife goes out at 430 in the morning. She's afraid to walk to her car in this neighborhood because she's caught numerous people lurking in the cars coming out of bushes. I think we owe it to the whole community, the entire community to protect everybody, including the homeless and everybody else. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hello. I'm Myron Woolen, secretary of the Long Beach Gray Panthers. I'm here speaking not as a not for the Great Panthers, but as an individual. We are concerned about senior citizens, the Great Panthers and the problems that they have with homelessness. And we've heard an eloquent speaker talk about all the issues regarding the seniors. But I would like to issue a challenge to the city council and to Mayor Garcia. I by the way, I would say that you've done a great job. I really appreciate the fact that we now have this forum to speak. But the challenge I'd like to issue to the council is to set as a goal zero homelessness. Now, this is a goal, right? It's something you strive for. It's something you want you hope you can get. I would like the city council to do this now, if one of the ways we talked about getting rid of homelessness or reducing homelessness was a wonderful plan that Kelley proposed. But one of the things I heard in her presentation was that there were no resources that she was stuck because they weren't resources and she couldn't carry out plans. She couldn't continue to do things to reduce homelessness. So where where is this resource? Where can we get these resources? Well, one thing she mentioned was that it'd be volunteers. Well, I did volunteer work. I got with the drop in center and we did that. We, we, we we're a rich country. We should be able to solve this problem. Utah was able to solve and have zero homelessness. Why can't we? We should think outside the box. There's a proposition, J.J. in Los Angeles, which will require that whenever a department wants to make a zoning change, that they have to set aside a certain percentage, percentage of their housing to be affordable housing. Now, that's one way of doing it. You can't just do it in terms of volunteers. You have to have some oomph and some push behind it. The also, I would say that we should try and increase the penalties for false evictions and that would help with homelessness so they can get again, I urge you, adopt zero homelessness as your goal. Thank you, sir. Next speaker. But there's Espanol in English and Spanish. Okay. So make sure that double the time. When I noches Alcala I'll Garcia at out of context let me know. But as my coauthor we everybody thought numero uno. Good evening mayor and City Council. My name is Martha Cota and I live in the first council district. In my less ghetto. They see it as not knowing they want an overlap and we need a mirror nightmare. So to look is to pasando. Right. That closes. I lost. I just want to say this isn't news to us. We know this. I'm not surprised. And what's going on. Is those are the civil. Ontario maintenance consultant and Community Plan Quality. Kilcullen Theriault Catholic Community Papakura Community Not been enough. This happened. With. The previous mayor in office when they decided to come forward with what was called the Community Downtown. Plan and which I then. Addressed to the former mayor that he should remove the community component in the down community downtown by name because it had nothing to do with. The community involvement. Savvy and Kiran being single mean familias gave an asset of this place plethora. The tallest idea is favela celebrity by that burrard-lucas that was underwritten. It was well known that 25,000 families were going to be displaced by this downtown plan. Was were you guys are you guys prepared for what's coming? MISKELLY You also of the assets all or possibly purchased, they're not normal additions to the economic cycle. Misskelley I know that you're doing the best that you can in your abilities to do what you can to solve the issue. But it is not in your power. It is in power. Our legislators and as. Mayor he does have Iraqi who aren't as familiar. Jealous And I also think that he has also s.d.s. There is a local character separate, but I want to say bottom in authority. I'm going to ask the public or whomever received a 30 to 60 day notice recently to please stand up. Let's take one divided by 15 enormous, you know, policy and another parochial can say Pakistan or should Yahya get out of the you know whatever representation they Miskelly Burkett or you and Trey Jarvis the piece on the man that I. Was unable to be here on time because. I today had to surrender the keys of the place that I. Was being displaced myself. Here you have at least less than 1% of the folks representing the folks that are actually being evicted, which may not be a lot to you, but it is. In la monica stonecutters thought familias and non-natives here and non-natives you'll say gate band of Galeria order I think went about it. But la la la familia Salina is going to get something going about it back on plate that dollars. I'm in a building 14 units a total of 14 units. And in those 14 units, those are 14 families that are being evicted and there's only 50 vouchers a year. Do you think that that's going to be sufficient for the families that are being displaced. Those hotels? If Trump and Sanders say these things happen better than I do. No, no. Not accepting consensus. I mean, remember cupertino spent a couple of ninyo cannot get in as a party and only use an apartment. You may be asking if they're excepting pets in the hotels. But what I'm concerned and most worried about right now is the children. These hotel. Rooms sometimes. Don't even take children. You attract both. It's the mobile scandal part that meant we saw you a fan destroying Cinderella's edifice. You'll get into her office where they can see it like a witness to the op with me lobbing cientos and me by, you know, downtown Long Beach. NRDC says a la lawn is a la Anaheim. Well, thank God to give almost up my autism, where the question is. Are you developing affordable housing? And in my block there is at the rate for rent, there is $1,000. Do you think that we are going to be able to afford. That then go to was only that. You know there are like musicals about to start. I mean like I you. Admiral of politics. But it's not conclusive. Welcome on the lunatic note indicates that 80% of the gay youth in England don't plan to do something about it and that only one can acquire. But look at when I said no. Look when you are putting the police here. I'm glad, commander, the chiefs here. I commend him for his work because he is the one who. Also deals at the officers. And counter the homeless population. And their only thing that they can do is move him from one place to another. There's really nothing else that can be done. Doing a little more time just for the translation. So you can continue. No. You know, they said yes to Prabhupada. Yes, we in our seniors. Okay, he pronto. But on your way after my miracle pilot young yemisi now that I want to say very young them away, I should be seeing there any piece of pie that I personal seniors can. I'm trying to keep up looks okay so I did miss she has three students who are in the university and whom she's afraid because who are in college right now. And she's worried that they may end up homeless during their transitional phase. In addition, I am now entering I'm now a senior and now I'm concerned and worried to what my fate will lead as a senior. Well, there is, but I won't. Then don't. I might be told me school first. I committed the audit and they don't. They will not put up or get no ice office in this seat. Then I will say lost policy in the apartment. Those why can't this will stay to kill those policy and I I to like expand grandiose prophecy into nice office as his condolences. But all those Americans are those who stay there sapiens. They kick one documents will be released. Well, of course those who will follow not only that, but also start and order for their conquer. Love me in darkest hour. They like almost solution are total. So as I'm moving and transitioning out, do you even wonder, do you ask me, where do I put my things? I have to put them in a storage. That's where they go. Oh, man, it was a lie. And, oh. The best part. Okay, so I am. I am. I am urging my city council member and mayor. Was it was it. Difficult to how difficult. Was it to raise? No. Raise your salaries. Right. Let's go for elementary salary. You how hard it was to raise the salaries. The minimum wage. Yeah, well, I could stand up or Yarmouth, I could say compelling love lost both to de la Renta when I really like them almost always. And is it really that difficult for you guys to. Impose. A freeze and rent increases? So a freeze and rent increases. Comandante Luna. See what I mean? Quintanilla's policy? Yes. Lawman No, no, not anchor. Acquitted is the guest. I'm not used to you. No, no, no. My support of me for Bola hint that you're starting to be in some initial galaxy assignment layoff wearer. No foreboding windows. Because, I mean, this is when the Cowboys will send your son a kicker. Not even gonna be a chief when you. If you were to. If you or your officers. Ever see me in the street and a bench sleeping or whomever you see. Think about me. It's the ordinary folks like myself who are there and all these folks who are being evicted and displaced right now. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And I try to do extra time because the translation. But I'm going to try to go back to the to the time, please. Yes, sir. My name is John Kendrick, and I'm on the borderline of District one and District two. Thank you, ladies. Uh, I've heard and seen a lot tonight and a lot of things I hear tonight. I think it happened to me about 12 years ago. Nothing has changed. We have been in a chronic homeless state since 2005, 2007, and nothing's changed cept the faces just talking about it and everything. I want to thank the agencies that try to do their job with the overburdened and understaffed and underfunded programs. You know, it's hard. But also to us diplomacy, they call it. I was a homeless student of three children. One was a girl, one with special needs. And I was a major, a dual major, which I got two of my associates and a certificate. And the whole time there I tried to help the homeless. But when I ask people and put it up at the college multiple times, I heard it does not exist because we do not see it. You know, and today it's gotten worse. This part, it's not a Long Beach problem, a California problem or a state parliament. It's a national problem. And even in other countries now, it's pretty. So you can't run and hide somewhere else. You know, you're stuck. Where you at? You know, and. A lot of things I heard tonight, but I didn't hear. The fact that students are becoming prostitutes, looking for sugar daddies. Doing all kinds of things to get education. And then when they don't make it, they all. Thousands of dollars for education. People don't make it to school. You know, this problem is a problem that cannot go away. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. My name is George Anatole. His name is Manuel Tovar. Would you mind speaking into the mic, ma'am? Thank you so much. My name is George Genitals. This is Manuel Tovar. In about three weeks, we're going to be homeless, sleeping in our car. We are also addicts and recovery. I have nine and a half years. He has five years. So we know what it's like to be homeless. We've been there and we fought to get out. Now I've lived where I live. For three years I. Managed to live with me about eight months ago because he was homeless and needed help. I also have a caregiver. He has a caregiver. This Mike. Michael Dunphy bought our building and gave us a letter stating that they were happy to work with us and within two days gave us a 60 day notice and wanted us to pay rent. So now in three weeks, we're going to end up living in a car because there's no no affordable housing. This man, as soon as he bought the building, came in and started demoing. I'm not an idiot. I called the city. I called. Hey, I called the city and asked if it was legal. He doesn't even have permits. He's making our life miserable. And when I asked him about it, he told me, Oh, it's not personal. It's business. Well, this isn't personal. It's my life in years. We can't even find an apartment. We have incomes. I have money for a deposit. But nobody will rent to us because we don't make three times the amount of rent. I'm not asking for anybody to give me anything. I've worked hard to get where I'm at. I was homeless. I was a drug addict. Nine and a half years clean. We're going to end up homeless. You know what happens when you're homeless? You start hanging out in the wrong crowds and you might as well join them. And I don't want that for either one of us. I'm 56. I have lupus. I have Parkinson's. I'm on a liver transplant list. Imani's disabled from being homeless. He got jumped in the streets when he was 16. So we need help. There's got to be something somebody can do to help us. This is ridiculous. My whole building that. I live behind. Everybody is disabled. We're mentally ill and we're handicapped. And we're get treated like we're garbage. And it's not fair. So I'm not sure if we can have someone talk to her real quick, please, from from the health department. We want you to go down here for a second. And maybe many, too. Thank you, guys. All right. Hi. My name is Althea Youngblood. I also live in the same building as she does. And like she said, they they've just been demolition in the building. They didn't even introduce themselves to us. They just. They were my apartment three times with. An inspection, and they didn't even say hello. Well, your name is what? Mine. You know nothing. You ain't even didn't even take the time to introduce themselves and threw us out. We have 60 days. I used to be homeless. I'm from Mental Health America. I used to be homeless. I got off the streets and now I'm facing going back. You know, how how how can these people get away with this? How can they keep raising. Throwing us out to re ventilate a building. A building. This from 1924. They want to make it new. You want a new building? You buy a new building. You don't destroy an old building. Throwing a so out so he can raise the rent three times. How is that fair? It's not fair. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Leaving Mayor and City Council. My name is Tom Crow and I'm with Long Beach. Residents Empowered. And we want to thank the city council members who joined us on our recent crisis housing tour of Long Beach, where we took journalists and journalists and funders around to see what was going on in Long Beach. Tonight I am reading a letter from one of the residents who couldn't be here from 4446 Linden. My name is Barbara Brubaker. I live at 446 Linden, apartment number seven. I have lived there for 12 years and have lived in Long Beach for over 50 years. I am 69 years old. I live on a fixed income of $850 a month. I pay $750 a month to rent my small studio. In in the time I have lived here, I have constantly lived with roaches, bedbugs, and they've never once changed the carpets in 12 years. I have been homeless two different times in my life. The last time was for a few months. The village helped me find this apartment. I was given a 60 day notice to move. I have been looking and looking for another place to live and I can't seem to find something. I can afford to live in this area. I don't have a phone to call for apartments. I have to use the bus to search for a new place. I think I might have to live in a motel for a while until I can find another place to live. I do not know how they can just kick us out for no reason. They could have at least given us no indication or maybe even helped us. Helped relocate us. It's not fair what they're doing. They don't treat us right. They don't treat us like humans. No one should ever be evicted if they pay their rent on time. That's what I thought. I've been homeless before and I may be homeless again if I can't find another place to stay. As you all talk about the homeless, please think about us and how every single one of us is at risk of being homeless because of what is happening in Long Beach right now. I support more renter protections in Long Beach and I wish there was more affordable housing for people like me. Benita Brew Baker. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Neal Richman, a relatively recent member of the Long Beach community. My background is in affordable housing development. I was the executive director of Community Corporation of Santa monica a long time ago when it began to experience the effects of gentrification and rapid price increases. Of course, they had rent stabilization and the kinds of things you've heard about today. But they also started a nonprofit development corporation that purchased existing properties like these properties, rehabilitated them, but not for another economic group for the residents who live there now. And so I would really argue it's not just about inclusionary units. It's about taking out risk. We talked about at risk housing, at risk publicly subsidized housing. There's at risk private housing as well that can be purchased, put in nonprofit ownership, taken off the market and used to preserve livable environments, improved environments, affordable environments for residents. So I want you to encourage you to think about that and in coming up with a strategy to prevent homelessness. Thanks very much. Thank you. And before he goes up, just cutting off the speaker's list. Looks like we have the last person there, Shirley. So I'm going to go and cut that off. And then. And then anyone else that's in line. Please, please come forward and speak. Sitting and waiting in line. Oh, sir. Then you go ahead, please. My name is Miller, and I'm a product of what you have been speaking about. I had a. 40 year addiction. I've been from coast to coast and I've carried me with me. When I got here in Long Beach, I was introduced to a safer refuge as a chef, and through the village down the street and other world trade purposes, all the facilities that you had been speaking about is what helped me become who I am today. J. However, where I was living right down the street from her, I systematically, through the few years, watch them do block after block and they are down the hall purchasing this. That's none of my business. But I watch my neighbors being moved out, written, buildings ruined, invaded, and they're being up. Okay, so you want us out, but we don't have the money to be giving them. Landlord. Athens man. Lord Ward the island or the the. Yeah, I. So, I mean, it's not fair it. All I always say is if you don't want me to. Convert to where I came from. Help me. Hold on to what you showed me. You get. Thank you, sir. Good evening, Mr. Mayor. City Council. I don't want to repeat everything that happened, but I am working with the folks from four for six Linden, which is a 20 unit building, got by on September 9th and September 12th. They got issued a 60 day notice all across the board, just right up the street, another building at five, ten, five, 12. I don't know exactly what the address is. It has all kinds of crazy addresses. 24 unit building got beat up, 60 day notice. They all have to be out by November 20th, right before Thanksgiving. And I was just told by an MHRA worker that another building on Magnolia just got bought out because one of their clients is also housed there and they're going to be given a 30 or 60 day notice. So this is happening all over the place. Right. So and I know I know you have a tough job, homelessness. You got to deal with building affordable housing, affordable housing creation and also the prevention. Right. But there is stuff that you as city council, as leaders you can put into place right now. Right now, just just slow it down to help you to give you some breathing room, actually, you know, help these folks out. The people, the people that couldn't be here today, some that don't with that. They're too afraid to speak. They're disabled. They've been homeless. There's a veteran. There's a couple of veterans that are going to be put on the street. So near zero, veteran homelessness. What are we doing to keep them off of the streets? You can help that. You can help that. Right now, some folks that are already giving you the solutions. Right. There's there's just cause prevention. Eviction prevention. There's rent control. There's all kinds of stuff. And as program director of Live Long Beach residents empowered as a new community organizing group that's here, trying to advance justice in housing preservation and creation, renter protections and community economic development. I await the invitation to sit with you and to talk about some of these solutions. I want to sit with you and to be part of the solutions. I know it's going to be really difficult for you, but this this show of people today, all these stories, this can be you're your family. You wanted to look at us as people at homelessness, as human beings. These are people right here, right in front of you. This can be your mom. This can be your aunt. This can be your brother. This can be your sister. What are you going to say to them? Tell them that you're going to help them. Tell them that you're going to put renter protections in place to keep this from happening again. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Anton, and this is my sweater. And I don't know who's your friends on it. I had a 4.0. GPA. In college. Okay. Thank you. Your next speaker, please. Okay. Thank you, Mayor. City council members. And city officials that are here. Um, my name is Cynthia Jesus. And I received a 60 day notice along with the other tenants in my building. When our building was bought. We've all tried to pay our rent. They've denied our rents. Now, I don't know any landlord that wouldn't want their rent. You know, it's kind of absurd to me that you are willing to kick out these families because none of us are drug addicts. I'm a single mother, not by choice, but because I had to get out of the domestic violence situation and I had to do what was best for my kids now. And that was in 2013 that I was homeless because I was, you know, leaving a domestic violence situation. Here we are three years later, going into four. And now I'm about to be homeless again. And that is very terrifying to, like the other woman said, to have to look at your kids at night and, you know, not be able to tell them we're going to be here. They're asking me, what are we going to do for Halloween? I don't know because I don't know if I'm have a home, let alone take you to trick or treating. So I know everyone's here talking about the homelessness, but we got to look at the bigger picture here. None of these people like myself would not be homeless if these landlords would actually look at us as human beings . And not a check. That is the problem. So what I think that you should really look at is the bigger picture. If you have so many homelessness, then there's something wrong with these landlords, okay? Because they sell properties and guess what? The next person buys it. Both of them benefit, they both profit. But what do we profit? What do we get out of that before a foot behind us and get out? That's sad, you know, and it's sickening and it's saddening. You know, I'm getting evicted. And just the other day, I seen an elderly lady outside of 7-Eleven on Seventh and Cherry. And most of the officials will tell you it's very bad out there. And this woman was not asking for home. She wasn't asking for money. She was asking for something to eat because she had not ate in five days. I didn't know this woman. I took her in my house and I still fed her. Now, if everybody sat there and took the time to be caring of one another, we wouldn't be in this predicament that we are. Thank you for your time. Thank you. And then our last speaker will be me, Shirley Grayson. Thank you. I want to separate the room for a minute. And those of us who are of Judeo-Christian belief, I have a message for you. Jesus said in his in his message of Matthew 2531, When he returns, he will say to you, How many strangers did you not city council, not the mayor, not the attorney or manager , how many did you take in and to each of you individually? He will ask you, how many did you bring in? That's our big issue. The next time you can really put a time offering in our offering plate. First look at Deuteronomy 2612. Write it down, do Romney 1428 every three years. Your tie belongs to the poor, not your pastor. And they won't like because I'm saying it in this venue. But I must say it. Your tired belongs to the poor. Every three. Years. Proverbs 29 and seven. This is the definition of wickedness. The wicked care. Nothing for the poor. Matthew 24, Jesus said before he returns at the age of 33, he will be 33 when he returns. I will say to the wicked. Those of you who care nothing for the poor. Regardless of your title, you failed to do what I told you to do. That's what he's going to say. Now, my husband was the battalion chief, over 14 fire stations in Los Angeles City. And tonight he's in Inglewood Cemetery. Laying next to some homeless people. Because you homeless after you die. And when you leave here tonight, look up at the sky and the moon. If it's out. And then when you. Open your key to your house, regardless of the mortgage you're paying on it, go in a few steps and then. Walk out and look back up at the sky. And before you close your eyes tonight, you say to God. Please reveal to me that I am homeless now. Regardless of the house I live in. You're homeless. We're all homeless. Thank you, Mr. Assad. That concludes I conclude public comment. Let me let me just close this out in just a few things, and then we'll begin the council meeting. First, I want to I want to begin by just thanking everyone that came out tonight. I know a lot of people had to leave. People work. People have families. Things happen to children. But I just want to thank every single person that came in and those that came that I know that we had an overflow, overflow crowd as well. And I really appreciate the kind of the spirit of everyone's comments and their commitment. And really, I think the great ideas and passion that we show tonight. I especially want to thank people that came out that are currently experiencing homelessness or are about to experience homelessness or are fearful for their position, you know, in life and in our community and especially, thank you to all of you for having the courage to speak out on on your on your on your life and where you're at right now. I'll just again, just say one more time that I don't think that this conversation is somehow inclusive of just what's happening today. And there are will continue to be conversations in the community as certain council members have already hosted and will continue to host. And I'm really hoping that we begin to have some conversations as we lead up to this summit in early next year, which a lot of the people that were here and are here are actually planning a huge summit on this topic. And so I encourage us to to be involved in that. I also encourage, while it's a separate conversation, there is a connection between the two. There is an ongoing conversation right now about affordable housing that we're having with a variety of community meetings. Another one is coming up in a couple of weeks or in a week or so. And so that continues, and that will be before the council as well in the next couple of months. And so just thank you again for for contributing. It was a good conversation. I think it was one that needed to be heard. And so I just thank you again for coming out tonight. And so with that, I'm going to close the study session and I'm going to just take a short recess and then we'll adjourn just for a couple of minutes so we can get set up for the council meeting. Thank you. Thank you. Good. All right. We're going to go ahead and start the council meeting. Oh. Okay. If I can have everyone, please grab a seat for the council meeting. If you're not staying for the council meeting. If I can just have those. The rest of those folks either sit down or exit, please. Yeah. Okay. We're going to take the two items that I discussed earlier. First, Madam Court, can I go ahead and get the roll call, please? Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Pierce. Councilwoman Price. Councilmember Superman here. Councilwoman Mongo. Councilman Andrews. Councilmember Muranga. Councilman Austin. Vice Mayor Richardson. Mayor Garcia.",Recommendation to conduct a study session to receive and file a report on the current state of homelessness and review progress of last 10-year plan.,"Here are a few key points I took away from the presentation and public comments on homelessness in Long Beach:

- The city has made progress in reducing homelessness overall and ending veteran homelessness through coordinated efforts and partners like the Multi-Service Center and housing initiatives. However, the homeless population remains significant.

- Major challenges include lack of affordable/low-income housing units, rising rents displacing residents, shortage of services like mental health/substance abuse treatment, and impacts of things like the opioid crisis.

- Many advocated for more proactive prevention efforts upstream before people become homeless - affordable housing development, renter protections, services for at-risk populations like students, families, seniors on fixed incomes.

- There were calls for the city to explore all options - rent control, inclusionary zoning, using motels/conversions, expanding outreach teams, more substance abuse/mental health treatment, job training programs.

- Personal testimonies highlighted the trauma and struggles of those currently or formerly homeless, as well as residents at risk of displacement due to rent increases/evictions.

- Overall, there was appreciation for the city's efforts so far but a sense that bolder, more innovative solutions are needed with community-wide involvement to truly get ahead of the crisis.

In summary, it was a passionate discussion displaying the human impact of the crisis and calling for comprehensive, preventative strategies in addition to expanded services for those already homeless.",0.825,"Your role is to reason deeply about the substantive meaning and logical flow of information in each presentation first, without imposing rigid formatting constraints prematurely.

Recommendation to execute amendments to contract with Bellingham Marine Industries and Concept Marine Associates relating to the Alamitos Bay Marina. Rebuild Project and increase appropriations in the Marina Fund in the Parks Recreation and Marine Department District three. Thank you. And I know Councilwoman Price has a presentation to make, so if I can turn it over to her. Thank you very much, Vice Mayor. I want to first acknowledge Rick Jerry, who is here, he's the chair of the Marine Advisory Committee. And I want to thank him for his service and for everything that he's done to support this process. I also want to recognize the hard work and dedication that Parks Recreation and Marine Director Steven Scott and our Marine Bureau Manager Alveda Hallinan have displayed during the rebuild of our marinas a major undertaking and one of the largest infrastructure projects that the city has embarked upon. The city of Long Beach has the largest municipality managed marina in the United States. Our marinas are in the best location in California as vessels are protected by a series of offshore breakwaters and natural bays with easy access to open water and sailing conditions that are nearly perfect year round due to prevailing winds. All three of our city's marinas were originally built in the 1950s and the 1960s, and our occupancy rate has remained steady at 98% and 2005 and 2007. The city rebuilt the downtown marinas, and in 2011, construction started on the Alamitos Bay Marina, Bellingham Marine. The company completing this major infrastructure project is the global leader in design, manufacturing and construction of marinas. Bellingham Marine enjoys an unrivaled reputation within the industry and has installed more than 20 million square feet of concrete floating docks throughout the world. Reconstruction work has included demolition of existing wooden docks, removal of piles, dredging, installation of new piles, assembly and installation of concrete docks, upgraded utilities at the docks, as well as restroom and parking lot rebuilds. The magnitude of this project has required the Marine Bureau to. Temporarily. Relocate boat owners during reconstruction. Reconstruction includes demolition of existing wooden docks, removal of piles. I think already set those. To date, we have completed basins one, four, five and eight. Basin two is planned to be completed by spring 2016, and Basin three will be completed by December of 2017, followed by Basin six and seven in December 2018. The total estimated cost to rebuild the Alamitos Bay Marina is $110 million. I want to thank John GROSS and Alveda Hannan and Hallinan for working so closely with one another when we earlier this year approved. The. The bond sales. They have done a fantastic job. And I'm so grateful for their their service and their commitment to this project. Thanks to our chief of staff, Julie Maliki, we have a short video that we'd like to show regarding the rebuilding process for Basin four, which is the basin located next to the Long Beach Yacht Club . Instead. You. And of course. This move. Your face. Really? See. Running away. Julie That was awesome. I'm wondering if that song is part of Julie Maliki's playlist. I would have gone with more of a Spanish flare song, but that was good. I liked it. Thank you very much, Julie, and the team that she assembled to put this video together. Honestly, this project is so amazing. The marinas look wonderful. Almost brought me to tears to watch that video. I'm so proud to have that in the city of Long Beach. Boat owners all around the region thank us and are so appreciative for this process. We are way ahead of so many other marinas and still offering these these spaces at a very reasonable cost to to the user. So I am so grateful for that. I'm not sure if there's a staff report. I just kind of took over. But I. Can't remember. I think you covered it very well and we're available to answer questions if needed. Thank you guys very much. This is such a pride for the city of Long Beach. I'm so grateful for your leadership. And Elvira's very balanced. Mechanisms that she uses to make sure that boat owners are treated consistently and fairly. I'm so grateful for that. I think that's a very important attribute to bring to the position. So thank you, Alveda. Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. Is there any member of the public? Well, Councilwoman Price, I'm sorry. I forgot to mention one thing. I would be remiss not to mention that my colleague, council member, Iran is on the Coastal Commission and I thank him for all the approvals that made this project possible because without their support, we would not be able to do these great things with our properties along the coast. So thank you. You can speak on this item. Yes, I was going to. Okay. Thank you. Diana Le Jean. I think it's just really brief. I've seen a figure here of $96 million. Almost. Close to $100 million. Is that what it is? I'm. I'm just sorry. I'm just having such a hard time with that. That amount of money. It's beautiful. I mean, there's no question about it, but I'm having a really hard time understanding $100 million. And yet here we're we I mean, on some boats and a luxury item when people who are sick and and we're we're arguing about you know it will be coming up but I'm just amazed at the amount of money being spent here when we're we're worried about a fairly small amount of money facilitating people who are really , really sick. So I just. Had to say that. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi. My name's Stephanie Dawson. So I'm a resident of Second District. I'm just struck by the kind of contrast that was created today. We had the chief of the Housing Department talking about a 120 day wait list for applicants, which I will add there is a they have not accepted more people on the waitlist since 2007. As a result of this, we're now subsidizing essentially the cheapest rent in the city of Long Beach by providing $100 million to dredge this and reformat this marina for boat slips that costs $500 a month. So in the era of a fort, when we're in desperate need for affordable housing, when people are losing their homes because they're being priced out of the city of Long Beach. $100 million would go really, really far to developing places where people can actually live. Councilman Price. Thank you. If I could just have staff educate the folks regarding where the money for the marina rebuild came from. I think there's some confusion, miscommunication there. Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor. Yes, we'd absolutely like to do that. This is a completely restricted fund. This is the Marina Sub Fund of the Tidelands. This is money collected by boat owners and can only be used for boat owner purposes. It could not be used for any of the other purposes that we would use in the city. So none, no general fund funds were used, no tidelands dollars with the exception of marina funds in the sub funding of the Tidelands Fund. Thank you. I appreciate that. There's been a motion and a second. Is there any member of the public that wishes to address Council on item 14? See none. Members cast your vote. Councilwoman Mango's, Councilman Andrews.

The presentation covered the rebuild project for the Alamitos Bay Marina in Long Beach, one of the largest municipality-managed marinas in the United States. The nearly $110 million project involves demolishing old wooden docks, removing piles, dredging, installing new piles and concrete floating docks, and upgrading utilities and facilities.

Major points:

- Long Beach's marinas are ideally located with easy ocean access and near-perfect sailing conditions year-round.

- The existing marinas dated back to the 1950s-60s and were in need of rebuild. 

- Bellingham Marine, a global leader in marina construction, was contracted for the project.

- Work is being done in phases by basin, with Basins 1,4,5,8 complete, Basin 2 expected by Spring 2016, Basin 3 by end of 2017, and Basins 6,7 by end of 2018.

- Funding comes entirely from the restricted Marina Fund supplied by boat owner fees, not impacting the general fund.

- Council thanked staff for their hard work managing this major infrastructure project that enhances a key Long Beach amenity.

Now we'll move forward with item 19, please. Communication from Councilwoman Allen Councilman's and Diaz. Vice Mayor Richardson Recommendation to request city manager to work with the Health and Human Services Department to provide an overview of the food safety program, education and enforcement at food facilities. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen. Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor. I brought this item in response to some concerns that I have heard raised by restaurant owners in my district and which I know they have also been echoed elsewhere in the city. There are 2200 operators in our city and that's a huge number. These operators are small business owners, families, community partners. They are also donors who support youth sports leagues, neighborhood associations and their innovations in food and their continued presence in Long Beach are helping drive the city's economic and the tourism resurgence. Over the past two years, restaurants and caterers in Long Beach and across this country has suffered challenge after challenge. And it's become apparent that there is a disconnect here. So I would like us as a council to ask the health department to update us on their processes, especially with sidewalk vending and food truck regulatory processes starting. We must reassure the brick and mortar operators that fairness is is top of mind. We also ensure that fairness is the starting point for inspections and for regulations for both brick and mortar and for the mobile food facilities. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Sara. Yes. I just want to add my support to this item. This is a great item, Councilwoman Allen, and thank you for council members and Dana and vice mayor for signing on. I just want to reiterate how important it is to make sure there is clarity around the education and process, as we do want to consider how we're doing and ensuring everyone has the appropriate information to do business because that's really what we want to make sure we do, is ensure our businesses are successful, that they're not limited or hindered by some of these process if we are able to make them available and clear, especially for our sidewalk vendors as we're going to be moving through with our state legislation process and other ways that we're going to try to make sure we support their business as well as our brick and mortar. So just support this item. Great item. Thank you, Councilwoman Zendaya's. Thank you and thank you to Councilwoman Allen for bringing up this very, very important item. I think it's very important that we really look at how we can help our brick and mortar businesses that that are serving food. I think that in the last few years, it has been really hard, and that's only an understatement. And if you're a business owner out there, a restaurant in this town there, you know that that is very true. And one of the things that I think is important is for all of us to be on the same page and understand that there's certain things, certain processes that that our brick and mortar businesses have to go through. And with those processes can be then one of the things that's very important to me and why I support this item very much is that a lot of those fees sometimes hurt our businesses instead of helping them. And one of the things that we really want to do is be able to help these businesses, especially because if they thrive, all of our communities thrive. So very, very happy to support this side of things. Councilwoman. Thank you. You have emotion and a second believe there's no additional comments. If there is a. Common. Yes, there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item 19 in person. Please line up at the podium there. Any members of the public that would like to speak on item 19 in Zoom, please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine. No. In person. You know, I'm going to have to give Mr. Supernova's props, because I think that that nine one vote sorry, eight one vote that we had the other day was prophetic. We're going to have issues. City of Los Angeles is already starting to hunker down on the health and sanitary conditions of a lot of the vendors. It doesn't really make sense. I pay for a city license, a business license. I operate a storefront. I don't think it's fair for a lot of us in terms of preparation. What we have to deal with in comparison to the lack of those type of standards being applicable to people just because they're outside. I think that I want to be fair and courteous to the communities that those come from. But, you know, speaking from personal experience, you know, my grandmother almost died from a E.coli experience that she had with a sidewalk vendor. And so it's not to say or to cast that a shadow or a cloud on everyone. But, you know, I know if there's no operator health person going to every single thousands of people who are operating throughout the city and inspecting if they have a side thing or, you know, if they're up to standard. So there needs to be some type of byline that we can all bridge about because when liability is concern, I'm sure the city knows that it always lands in the lap of, you know, the general fund. So hopefully we can come to some agreement about what sanitation looks like for food preparation. And you know what? What's the future to be? Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Cipriano. As long as Mr. Can for a reference meeting, I thought I should go ahead and speak. I know we have staff here, so if I could ask a question about health inspections now. It's my understanding that the health guidelines are established at the state level. If there's that if there's a training component locally, would that not have to be state driven? And if there's not an answer for that because you haven't looked into this yet, I completely accept that. But to my way of thinking, I didn't understand how a local health official who is burdened with making inspections would have the time or the authority to train individual operators in restaurants. Good afternoon, counsel. I'm from. My name is Morgan Warfield. I am with the Environmental, Health, Health and Human Services. I'm the operations officer. Thank you for having me here. The training does come from the state, either from California, Department of Health or sometimes from FDA. We have a standardization that is overseen by FDA. We also provide training every time that we have interaction with our food establishments, either it's from the owner or from the manager or any of the employees within the establishment. Okay. Thank you for that. And that's my understanding that what training comes about, then it's incumbent on the operator of the restaurant to go ahead and train staff. So based on that and the fact that I have not received any complaints from restaurant tours, that I will not be in support. Thank you. Thank you. There is a motion and a second. Members, please go and cast your votes. District one. Oh, I'm sorry. We actually need to do roll call. We have two folks that are virtual. So remarkable. District one. Right. District two i. District three. My district for NE District five. By District six I District seven, my district eight, our district nine high. Motion is carried eight one.",Recommendation to request City Manager to work with the Health and Human Services Department to report back to the City Council within 45 days to provide an overview of food safety program education and enforcement at food facilities and to propose recommendations to substantially address concerns raised by local restaurant operators and residents.,"Here is a focused summary of the key points from the presentation:

The City Council discussed concerns raised by brick-and-mortar restaurant owners regarding perceived unfair regulations and enforcement compared to sidewalk vendors and food trucks. The core objectives were:

1) Request the City Manager to work with the Health and Human Services Department to provide an overview of the food safety program, education processes, and enforcement procedures for all food facilities - brick-and-mortar restaurants, sidewalk vendors, and food trucks. 

2) Ensure fairness and clarity around inspections, regulations, and processes for all food business operators, whether brick-and-mortar or mobile vendors.

3) Support small business restaurant owners who are community partners and drivers of the local economy, while also facilitating the new state legislation allowing sidewalk vending.

The reasoning cited included the challenges restaurants have faced over the past two years, the need for clear education on requirements, concern that fees may be hindering businesses instead of helping them thrive, and addressing potential public health risks from unlicensed/uninspected vendors.

Relevant background: There are 2,200 permitted food operators in the city. Health code regulations and food handler training requirements come from the state level, but the city conducts inspections and some supplemental training. A public commenter raised concerns about liability and inconsistent sanitation standards between different vendor types.

After discussion, the motion to request the overview from the Health department passed 8-1.",0.8666666666666667,"Your role is to reason deeply about the substantive meaning and logical flow of information in each presentation first, without imposing rigid formatting constraints prematurely.

Okay, now Nicholson is not here. Okay. And I called Mr. Kennedy. Mrs. Kennedy, not here. Okay. Mr. Kennedy, I hear we're going to go ahead and here item madam. Quick item number eight. Item eight, say communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Councilmember Pierce, Councilmember, your UNGA recommendation to request the city manager to explore the feasibility of establishing a farmers market ordinance that requires farmer's market in Long Beach to accept cow fresh electronic benefit transfer cards. Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. The purpose of this recommendation is simple. We want to make sure as many residents as possible gain unfettered access to fresh fruit. Now we know because our health department, our heels on many of our initiatives in our city, have done this work for years, that there are barriers to accessing fresh fruits and vegetables . And farmer's markets have really been a they've been a a real they've done a lot of good work in making sure that we've we actually have these have access to these in our community. We worked for a number of years on a number of different farmer's markets in North Palm Beach. And it was frankly, it was different, difficult to navigate in terms of getting them established, making sure that they're sustainable, making sure it's easy to engage with the city. We've done mobile food stands. We've done a number of different activities. And we've noticed that some cities have taken some steps, like making sure that you deal with one point of contact and like sort of one expert, a farmer's market expert in our city that helps you to navigate those those permits that are across multiple departments. It didn't cost any money. It was a matter of just sort of realigning how we engage. So what we want to do here is we want to explore two things. We have a farmer's market in our city. We want to we want to explore the feasibility of making sure that you do accept the Cal Fresh program. Cal Fresh has accepted in a number of our farmers markets and having a policy that ensures access to all of them, or at least those are located on city property makes sense to me and can further ensure that our residents do have that access to fresh fruit and vegetables. Now there is a perception that applying to accept and implement Cal. Cal Fresh can be confusing and difficult. So I want to make sure that this feasibility study looks into looks into this perception. And if it does seem to be true that it's, you know, unfeasible. Then we look at ways to ensure that the city can assist these farmer's markets in ways to make this reality. So this is a good thing. This isn't intended to be a burden on an existing farmer's market. The point here is we want to make sure that we do assist these farmer's markets because, you know, the outreach we've done, these folks, they want to achieve it, but they've they've run into, you know, different issues here, there. So this is an opportunity for us to take another look at these barriers, get some expertize in terms of someone locally, internally that can help them navigate this and see how we can make sure that we look at these permits, license fees, any other barriers to establishing markets and to having our own sort of ombudsman as well as access to the Cal Fish program. And the hope is that we explore this. We come back within the next 60 days. What I'd like to see is, hey, these are what the burdens are that we've heard of, and this is where we think we can be. We don't want this to be a punitive process. These are these are typically good minded folks. These these individuals do farmers markets. We want to just make sure that we're sending the right message to the whole community. And, you know, other cities are starting to navigate some of the same stuff, that this is an opportunity for us to also be aligned with other cities that are taking taking these steps. So that's the gist of this. So this is my motion. And thank you, Councilman you, Ranga, for your second. Councilmember, your ranga. Thank you, Vice Mayor Richardson, for bringing this forward and for inviting me to participate in this and this issue. I think it's very important that we expand the opportunity for farmer's markets to get out there, and I hope that this does precisely that, as well as providing an additional option for people with cards to purchase some fresh fruit and vegetables. So I totally support this this this item. Thank you. Councilman Price. Thank you. To support this item, I think it's a really fantastic concept and I'm happy that we're requesting a feasibility study because there be a couple of components that hopefully would be included in the study. And I'm hoping that the maker of the motion and the authors of this item are supportive of a study that would include a couple of things. The first is, you know, having a liaison, farmers market liaison or ombudsmen, as Vice Mayor Richardson mentioned, is a good idea. But I would really caution us to explore and think outside the box about who that person could be like. Could it be an existing staff member that we have or a management assistant or even an intern who wants to later work with the city that might be able to take on a program like that so that we're not, you know, spending money on another position, especially with I don't know that a new position would be warranted for just this responsibility, but I just want to be mindful of that. And then the second would be, I would hope that the feasibility study would include things such as maybe doing a pilot in certain areas, because I'm assuming there would be some costs associated with purchasing the card reader or having a staff member or volunteer work the station where the card reader is. So hopefully the feasibility study would look at what that kind of a cost would be, whether people can opt in and out based on demand at their market, so that, as Vice Mayor Richardson said, we're not placing a burden because I don't view this item as intending to place an additional burden. So I support it. And hopefully Vice Mayor Richardson and the authors are agreeable with the feasibility study being broad enough to include those two topics. Thank you. I just want to respond. So I'm good, but I do want to say something every time we want to do something for for people who are in need, we always claim fiscal problems there. There was nothing in this motion that says hire anybody. We had help people in our health department. And I just want to be clear, make a statement here. We have people in our health department. We're just asking them to take a look at the best way to do this. So I don't want to make it seem like we have to be creative or don't spend a dollar that's not in this motion. We want I mean, we have we have capable staff here. We have management assistance. We have all these individuals. And if there are concerns, I would hope that we don't muck up this by saying, hey, this isn't really important, therefore let's make sure we don't spend any money on this. That's not the message I want to send here. We've done this a number of times where we explore different things and our staff is creative and able to figure it out. So I do want to be clear this is important. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables is important, and they will do their diligence, city staff on the feasibility and report back. And in terms of the other the other recommendation in terms of pilot, I don't support a pilot. I think we should there's only a number of farmer's markets in our city and some that are in the process. I think we should talk to those ten different individuals. It's not that many and see if this is feasible. So, no, I think no matter where you live, we should be trying to provide access, not about a pilot. We throw out an idea about a pilot, about ARVs. No. After having those conversations and sort of we came to a place that, you know, the whole city deserves this. So I would not be open to a pilot. I think we need to have this conversation. It comes back and it's not feasible. Then we'll address it. Those are my positions on that. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzales. Yes. I'd like to thank Vice Mayor Richardson and Council Member Saranga for being bringing this forward. I think it's a great item. I would agree to that. We need to keep something more longstanding and sustainable in the city of Long Beach. I know that some farmers markets do already accept MBT, which is fantastic. If we can look into this a bit further, it would be great. I would add one thing, though, if you would be up for this tiny, friendly amendment, but it would just be, and I'm sure you've already thought of it. Just knowing you is outreach to and trying to create better outreach to Cal State, Long Beach students and Long Beach City College students. I think all of us know the statistics are about one in five of every CSU or college student is suffering from lack of healthy, good, healthy food. And so I think if we bolster that program a bit and I know Cal State Long Beach is already doing this to some extent, it would be good to highlight that if we do get something in place. Absolutely. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. I'm going to be supporting this item because I think it makes good sense. And I would just ask that, you know, the we may not always agree 100%, but a disagreement. And I welcome the input from all of my colleagues. I have a couple of farmers markets in my district. I've always been very supportive of them. I will continue to do so. I will recommend the staff go and talk to the folks at the government leaders who've implemented CBT at the farmers market like three years ago. So this is not anything new. Other farmers markets actually do already recognize MBT And, you know, it's just a process, I think, working with the county to get a system in place to coordinate that. And so I'll be supportive of this and invite you guys to visit the Uptown Farmers Market every Thursday, 6 p.m.. Thank you. Councilman Price. Thank you. And I just want to clarify, I wasn't trying to, quote, make up any item. I think it's a great item. So I said that before I'm and I repeat it because I think maybe that was lost on me just asking a few questions. Sometimes when we support one another's comments, we also ask tough questions or we ask questions that are interesting to our constituents. So in this particular case, we did reach out to our farmers market. And the only thing they said was, could the report include the possibility of, you know, would there be any costs associated with a card reader and a staff member to man, that particular man or woman, that particular station? And if so, then could the farmer's market have the opportunity to determine whether or not they have a customer base for T readers? So that's all I was trying to say. I really wasn't trying to be negative about the item or say anything other than it's completely 1,000% fantastic. I was just asking a few questions and even if there were a fee associated with it, I'm not saying let's not do it. I'm just saying like like I said and then you repeated management assistance people in the in the current city. Those are opportunities for us to actually give people an experience in running a program like this, which would be a really great experience. So that's all I was trying to say. I just want to clarify, you know, just because we ask a question about a council's item and ask it in a particular I mean, I've seen really harsh questions be asked preceding someone voting in favor of an item. It's not personal and the item is fantastic. Let me repeat that. The item is fantastic. I just want to make sure the report is broad. Thank you. Thank you. I'll just I'll just say thank you for your clarification. It wasn't really directed at you. I'm just careful with the message that we send to some of our more vulnerable neighborhoods. I don't want them to think any time there's an idea to help support them, that it always we always sort of go to this place of, you know, fiscally it's difficult to achieve. So unfortunately, it came out this way, but it is something I have noticed moving, you know, when we take on issues like this. So but I'm happy we were able to land how we land. Thank you. Thank you. Public comment. Please come forward. Hi. My name is Kate Sarnoff. I live in the third district and my family goes to two farmers markets every single week and we love it. And even though I am very, very privileged to live in a high income neighborhood and run into a lot of well-heeled people at those two farmers markets, I would love to see people of all stripes and incomes at that farmer's market and to be attracted to those farmers markets because they know that there is a beauty there. And I am also here representing the Long Beach Alliance for Food and Fitness, which is working towards reducing diabetes and other diseases and conditions related to obesity here in Long Beach. We know that we have very high obesity rates, very high diabetes rates, and we are working on policies to reduce that. This is. One of those. Policies that could help because people don't have most people my family accepted don't have the access to fresh fruits and vegetables that that they deserve to have. My understanding is that the vast majority, perhaps eight out of. Ten, nine out of 11. Of the farmer's markets in Long Beach already have this up and running and have for a long time. And it's no big deal. Right. So I don't think that we need a pilot because we have those experiences to go from. I can also say that Long Beach Alliance for Food and Fitness reached out to one of those farmer's markets that does have a diverse customer base, that does not have the beauty in place and offered to help them and were we did not get a response on that. And that's part of why we very much support this effort to just have an across the board policy. If we're going to be having more farmers markets that come. On board, well, they'll have a heads up already. But this is something that needs to go into their business plan. So I don't think it's rocket science. I'm sure that our our current staff could could handle it. And I'm very excited to see us take a clear position on it and support low income people who need fresh produce. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Mayor, and members of City Council. My name is Tony Demeaco and I am co-director of Long Beach Fresh. We work as a local Food Policy Council. I'm also a member of the executive committee of the Long Beach Alliance for Food and Fitness. So we have been part of these conversations and very interested in finding creative ways to support farmers markets. And, you know, there's a couple of challenges that are very consistent with farmers markets. One is that it is actually, contrary to popular belief, quite difficult and cumbersome to acquire EBT status. You know, there's a federal process, but there is also the kind of complicated process of trying to choose a third party processor. As you may know, these processors are often banks and they operate at a profit. And, you know, they market their services quite heavily. And there are kind of multiple ever levels or tiers of fees that they charge from per transaction fees to ATM machine fees. And there have been federal grants that have sought to make the machines free. But those grants from folks we've talked to are often the money's dried up by the time you apply for it. So there are real barriers with actually getting there with elite status, and we definitely hope the study would look at that as well as the broader challenges to opening a farmer's market. I think then we can best help and I know this is something that Los Angeles recently passed, and I think they had sufficient ideas in place to better support the markets. And I think there are a lot of things the city could do, potentially even looking at ways that the city could actually vet the third party processors, you know, to maybe get better deals with them for the local farmers market. So we're just a few ideas from the conversations we've had, but I know a lot of our smaller vendors and you know, I know that farm stands probably wouldn't fall into it, but those are a lot of the folks we've talked to, like the folks that growing experience Farm or Lincoln Spring Farm stand. And it's been very difficult for them to get there, even though they've been working on it for quite some time. So thank you to the member or Vice Mayor Richardson for bringing this forward. We think it's a great thing and we just hope the study will be brought into a little bit so we can better address the challenges of getting it status. And just I guess one last thing to mention is that the markets that we found have been most successful with the VTR, the ones that fall under the in like high poverty areas. But that's primarily because they're able to take advantage of market match, which is a statewide program that we worked for a couple of years with this statewide Food Policy Council to get the state to commit $5 million of funding to and receive federal matching grants. So this program is exceptional and really helps to counter the notion that farmer's markets are too expensive because it doubles people's purchasing power. And currently, I think all of the markets that are eligible for this program in Long Beach are utilizing it and are very successful. So that's something to look at as well. That would boost CBT benefits quite a bit for those who need it the most. Thank you. Thank you. And the other speakers, Mr. Goodhue. Very good to clear as the address. My experience with farmers markets began with the when they disingenuous operator the one that operates the what's essentially a de facto arts and craft market in the Long Beach slipped it in as a farmers market and misrepresented the fact that while this was going to be a home a a part of, the proceeds will go to the Alamitos Heights Homeowners Association. And the first thing we heard was the president of the association said they could not associate with that because of and this began my education a true farmers market. Which I seriously doubt we have in this city. I think the majority and we have our arts and craft markets. A true farmers market is regulated by the federal government. The intent was and the intent is today to bring fresh fruits and vegetables to areas of a city or a county or a country or area that does not have a Ralphs, that does not have a lawn, that does not have a food for last, that does not have a smart and final period. You go down there now and in the the one weekly at the end that they snuck into the Marine Stadium. It is. They've got liquor. T-shirts. Everything you find out at the checkouts stand at the 99 cent store. Very little that would qualify. I think they have some. But you go down there and check it yourself. Next week I've got two pictures of an I'll show there. They are not. They are, in fact. And what you need to understand are really what I say. Arts and craft, market spirit. Now. In addition to that, they are an attraction for these. They come down and scope out the neighborhood. I think I related a couple of years ago about the conversation I heard with two guys coming down in the blue line about the one in North Long Beach. And they were telling how you know where to go during that and the shops and the residents to go because everybody's down there and so forth. So I would suggest you really get inside of it and figure it out, because what you're actually also doing is inherently reducing or intensifying the propensity of a Ralphs or a local food market to pull up stakes. I don't know how most of you are really, pal people. All right. They operate on very thin and thin margins. And when you suck out a little every little bit, it, you know, takes its toll period. So I would suggest that you do your study and go around for yourselves and check how much your arts and crap and how much of your actually true vegetables and fruits certified by the government is the type that they intend to destroy and distribute. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Robb report from black votes matter. Okay, this is a good thing. I agree with it because everybody needs vegetables and all that. You know, it's easy to do something like this because everybody's going to be on the beat and they're going to stay on the beat. With these policies, we need more policies as something that can really put something in people's pockets like that airport that left that could have brought jobs, but it didn't. Okay. Like dealing with a legal situation, like not making this a sanctuary city. If you wouldn't have done all that and everybody voted on that, then that would have been many more dollars freed up, which I happen to know. You support a lot of these groups with. Or or Karl Marx is over there. You know that she should have willed her out. The a wheelbarrow shouldn't even allow her to sit there, you know. Anyway, so we're going to need a beat, you know, because there's a lot of homeless people, veterans. As I walk through, I see them sleeping right by the library and know piss on the ground. And I remember, what, about three months ago, there was a $25 million bus be for the homeless. I want to run and ask money. Nobody heard about nothing. They knew. I told them about nothing. Then we just passed something else for the homeless. Some always pass for the homeless. But don't. Nothing change, you know. So that's a good thing because they're all on the beat. And I talk to a lot of them. A lot of these homeless living in the canal got degrees on this meth and heroin, you know? So we really need to do something about that. That's a good thing. But let's change these policies. Listen, I was coming just hard and I'm not going to just keep coming because we need I'm serious. We need to do stuff, and I'm gonna come hard and certain things. But come on, now, all this. 809. No, listen, let's get some good stuff and not just be going one way and let's really do something, you know? And Donald Trump is the man. Remember that? He's the man. He was the man before he became president. He's really the man now. Don't mess with Trump. You get Trump out. All right. Thank you. Seeing no other public comment, we have a motion in a second on the floor. Where did the airport. Poor girl. Still here. There's a there's a motion any second on the floor by Vice Mayor Richardson and members. Please go ahead and cast your vote. Motion carries.","Recommendation to request City Manager to explore the feasibility of establishing a farmers market ordinance that requires farmers markets in Long Beach to accept CalFresh Electronic Benefit Transfer cards; and Recommendation to review a reduction of permit fees, license fees, and any other barriers to establishing farmers markets in Long Beach, and report back to City Council in 60 days.","Here is a focused summary capturing the core objectives, proposed initiatives, reasoning, and relevant context:

The central proposal is to request a feasibility study from the city manager on establishing an ordinance that would require farmers markets in Long Beach to accept CalFresh (EBT/food stamps). The key objectives are:

1) Increase access to fresh fruits and vegetables for low-income residents by ensuring CalFresh can be used at all farmers markets, especially those on city property. 

2) Assess and address any barriers or difficulties farmers markets face in implementing CalFresh acceptance, such as confusing application processes or fees.

3) Explore having a centralized ""farmers market expert"" or ombudsman within the city to help markets navigate permitting, licensing and accessing CalFresh.

The reasoning is that fresh produce can be difficult to access in some neighborhoods, and farmers markets help fill that gap. However, markets have faced challenges establishing themselves and accepting CalFresh. An ordinance and centralized assistance could make CalFresh viable for all markets.

Supporters argue this increases food access equitably without being overly burdensome if implemented properly. Concerns were raised about potential costs for equipment like card readers, though the proposal aims to avoid new expenses. Overall, the intent is to study how to make farmers markets maximally accessible to CalFresh users.",0.0,"Your role is to reason deeply about the substantive meaning and logical flow of information in each presentation first, without imposing rigid formatting constraints prematurely.

Recommendation to Request City Attorney to prepare an ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code just cause for termination of tenancies to include the modifications included an option to an adopt an ordinance to extend the prohibition on termination of certain lawful residential tenancies through February 28, 2022. Declaring the urgency thereof and declaring that the ordinance shall take effect immediately citywide. There are two votes required for this item. Thank you. City staff. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Members of the council, we do have a fairly detailed staff report. This is a complex topic. We've done a lot of outreach and there's been a lot of discussions over the past year or so. But to turn it over to our team, to help walk you through the work that's been done, some of the background on the issues as well as three various options and a staff recommendation for your consideration. So I would turn to Oscar Dorsey, our Director Development Services. Thank you, Mayor, and members of the City Council in in 2018. Give me 1/2. In 2018, tenants and owners representing representatives join the city staff for a series of meetings to discuss potential tenant protection policies and to address the rising rents and tenant displacements. In March of 20 in the city and staff prepared a presentation that addressed several items related to this ongoing issue in the city. In March ten. On March 10th, 2020, the City Council adopted a just cause for termination tenancy ordinance to take further action regarding these protections. Our staff is available here and we'll be providing a brief presentation with additional information. Okay, Counsel, I'm going to walk you through some slides. Thank you for the background, Oscar. So what we're talking about today. Is not all of expense, but a specific sub category of evictions related to what's called substantial remodel. And this is not an area unique to the city. This flows out of state law. But the city has the ability to take further action on these categories of landlord tenant relations. So back in. July of this year. A council directed us to draft a moratorium, which we are. Under at this time, and it prohibits just cause. Evictions related to substantial remodel. And there's other provisions of state law and for a period of time, county provisions that also restricted such evictions. The city council, our staff, during the time of that moratorium to evaluate the feasibility and cost of different programs, one being known as the renovation administration program, which you see in cities that have rent control, such as Santa monica and Los Angeles, and other programs which are described as options two and three. And her staff report that we're going to talk about in just a moment. But first, we're going to start with what is a renovation administration program. And Patrick is going to walk you through that. Thank you, Christopher. So what is a renovation administration program? The city of Los Angeles has implemented such a program and it's referred to as a tenant habitability program or THP. This program requires extensive city staff involvement and oversight of rental residential remodel projects, including mitigation of construction impacts to tenants noticing requirements on the submission of an extensive plan. I'm sorry. I'm noticing again. Noticing the tenants. US property inspections. I'm sorry. I can't read this. Wrong glasses. I'm sorry, everyone. So this is a cumbersome and lengthy process that may deter landlords from making needed repairs. We found that only cities with rent control programs administer thp. And a THP is linked to those rent control programs and it helps to rent vacancy control at those rent controlled events. We had three stakeholder engagement meetings in August and September. These are some of the stakeholder comments from the tenant stakeholder meeting held on August 25th. These are some from August 26. This is the property owners stakeholder comments. Property owners were concerned about a lack of data. And they wanted to see substantial more and more clearly defined. The third meeting included both groups and comments were similar. We did have 26 attendees comment on their experience with displacement. We also had a survey and there were 87 responses to that survey. And this slide provides some of the key ideas and comments from the survey. As with the stakeholder meetings, there were 13 points of view expressed in the survey results. So there's not a lot of data on this subject. The city is not involved in the eviction process, and so we have no real data on evictions. Calmatters reports that 221 evictions were held since they were completed since May 2020. But there are no details available on the circumstances of those evictions. We do show that there's 879 permits that appear eligible for substantial remodels between March 2020 March 2021. And that number is similar to 2018 and 19. But that data does not clearly show that there's a tie to evictions and substantial remodels. When considering changes to the ordinance, it's important to know that renovation work is still necessary and important. 82% of our housing units were built before 1980 and major housing renovations are necessary. Your 30 and more so you're 50 and beyond. A THP is estimated to cost approximately $2 million to address these 879 potential applicants on an annual basis. And although there might be an opportunity to pass those costs along to property owners, which eventually will trickle down to tenants as rent increases, we feel that there's probably going to be a two year period and a cost of about $4 million for the project to get started. So we've we've got three options for the city council to consider tonight. The first option is to create a tenant habitability program. And option two is kind of a menu of potential modifications to the Jessica's ordinance. And that includes revise the definition to require time to vacate 60 days instead of 30 days. Revise the definition and more clearly define what work is qualified as substantial remodel. Establish a civil fine of up to $15,000, payable by landlords to tenants. When a court has found a manner to have violated just the just cause ordinance. And the final two are revised. The ordinance to require owners to notify the city when people are being evicted due to this provision of the ordinance. And finally revised the ordinance to require a 30 day notice to vacate. I'm sorry, a 90 day notice to vacate instead of the current 30 and 60. And then finally, option three would be to increase the permanent relocation benefits to 40 $500 per household instead of the current one month's rent that's in the ordinance. And this option could be considered by itself or it could be combined with the menu of items. An option to. So again, we're here with the recommendation to modify the ordinance to include the provisions contained in option two. And then we're also asking that you adopt an ordinance amending the Chapter 8.1 or two to extend the prohibition on termination of tenancies due to this provision. That concludes my presentation. Thank you. Thank you. At this point, we'll go to public comment. We have 35 speakers in queue. So the rules say we go to 90 seconds and so I'll call up the first. I'm going to list the first ten. We have Reverend Sandy Richards, Paul Evans, Corliss Lee, John, alias Elaine Hutcherson, George Bustamante, Alexandra Connor Raya, John Edmund, Matthew Buck and Mike Murchison. So if you could come up, if you heard your name, call for the line up so we can process, you know, go through this process expeditiously. So first up is Reverend Sandy Richards. I guess we leave our mask on, right? Yes. Good evening, Vice Mayor and city council members. I'm Reverend Sandy Richards, and I'm the lead pastor of the Southwest United Methodist Church in Long Beach, located in District five and a part of Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice. I'm here tonight to speak in support of option one. As a pastor, I have seen testimonies of community members impacted by the substantial remodel evictions. Most of them are people of color and the elderly who are already very vulnerable and often do not have the resources to hire lawyers and fight for their rights. Option one is also important because of the oversight needed. Options two and three placed this burden on our current staffers, increasing their workload and potentially making oversight delayed or ineffective. As the text of the staff report reads, there is currently no existing staff infrastructure for intervention between landlords and tenants, as currently exists in the cities with rent stabilization in place. Long Beach has been making efforts to address structural racism and ensure equity in our community. We need a fair process that can hold landlords accountable for their repairs and protect tenants from unjust evictions and homelessness. The policy we vote for tonight has implications for today and generations to come. Leviticus 1918 tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves, which means to look after their wellbeing. I urge you to take bold leadership and vote option one and create a fair process. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Paul Evans and Corliss Lee and then John Elise. Paul. I didn't come down here. Just a moment, Paul. Okay. Paul's not here. Next call this lead, then John Elise and then Elaine Hutchison. Oh, you are here where you're up. Go ahead. You can you can swap in sign. Whoever wants to go next is great. All right. Thanks. Okay? Yeah. The prohibition on evictions should not be extended. Let's let it sunset. It harms all involved. A major expression, a major problem expressed by both tenants and landlords is a lack of housing. The best way to solve this is to let the free market work. Government intervention has contributed to the problem. Do nothing. Thank you. Lee then John and then John. Alias, then Elaine Hutchison. Callers. I think it was John Eilers, wasn't it? It's Corliss Lee is up now. Well, Corliss Lee, your next John. You're right. You're after Corliss. After me. After you. Yes. Excuse me. Thank you. Corliss High carelessly here. I'm not a landlord, but I've watched repeated agenda items that treat landlords unfairly. There seems to be an assumption that landlords have deep pockets and confirmed council decisions that favor tenants. Funding a new department designed to evaluate and control actions that would improve properties and require a tenant to vacate during the process. Seems to me to be city business and the city should pay for it. I was told today that in the year 2000, we had about 2000 personnel in the city and that today we have 6000. I think we. Have the people to deal with this. The city has deep pockets, a port, a convention center, an airport, property taxes, and the city should be funding their own bright ideas. Time and again, I hear council decisions that are a hardship for the small landlord. Is your goal to turn rental properties into a corporate business? Because if we lose the small business landlords, that's where we're going. Thank you, John. You are up. Thank you. My name is John Ayers. I feel like a gadfly sucking time up. However. I'm speaking against establishing a new department or court to implement the requirements that are spelled out in item 36. The creation of this department or funds is a problem. Looking for a solution. Or it's. Look, it's a non-problem. Looking for a solution and a waste of money. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Elaine Hutchison, then George Bustamante, then Alexandra Honoria. Elaine. Good evening. Yes, Honorable Mayor Garcia and Vice Honorable Vice Mayor Richardson and members of the city council. My name is Elaine Hutchison, and I'm here this evening as president of the Apartment Association of California Southern Cities. Thank you very much for this opportunity to speak on item 36 of this evening's agenda. We appreciate all the research and work done by the Development Services staff, which was made possible by Councilwoman Cindy Helen and. Councilwoman Sui Sara, who brought the item forward. Thank you. Thank you. George Bustamante, Alexandra Raya and John Hammond. George. Oh, I'm sorry. Can I go to 49? Oh, I'm sorry. Continue. Forgive you. Thank you. And pause. I'm ready to roll. Governor, going to say we support option three. Let's back up the clock. Go for it. Thank you. All right. Thank you. George Bustamante, Alexandra Correa and John Hammond. All right. Good evening, vice mayor and council members. My name is George Bustamante. I live in Long Beach. I work in Long Beach. I work at the brokerage real estate brokerage business. I own a business here. And I just want to speak out against and oppose this. I'm 36 and all phases of it. It doesn't matter which one of these. It mainly impacts small. Small owners. They have, you know, two, three, four units, six units, ten units. Most of it is in their life savings. The numbers were interesting to see from staff. If we were only remodeling about a thousand units a year, that's not very many units that really need work to help. Provide better housing. Clean housing and safe housing. And most of the owners I know, they don't like people that they try to maintain their buildings and they try to improve them. In some cases, they need to move people out to make improvements. But putting further hindrances on landlords doesn't improve the housing stock, doesn't make more affordable housing, and just keeps the city in sort of a static state and probably deteriorating housing inventory. That's it. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Alexandra and then John Edmund and then Matthew book. Alexandra. Honorable mayor, City. Council, City Manager and city staff. My name is Alex Catterall. I'm representing the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce and its membership in my comments. Both property owners and tenants who are represented by our coalition, which is made up of the Apartment Association of Southern California Cities Small Property Owners Alliance, California Apartment Association, the Civic West Association of Realtors and Chamber and the Chamber care about Long Beach and its future. As you may have seen in our petition, which has over 650 signatures from our membership, what we hear tenants say that they care about is homelessness, crime and quality of life. Property owners, provide rental housing to Long Beach residents and play a crucial role in Long Beach economy and city budget. Property owners also care about homelessness, crime, quality of life and the environment their tenants are living in because happy tenants mean happy property owners. Each of these property owners are small businesses that are trying to survive through a pandemic and all have chosen Long Beach as a worthy investment. Despite the housing stock needing more renovations and love than most in California due to the age of our housing, property owners, small businesses and tenants all want a safe and affordable environment. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next to John Edman there, Matthew Buck and Mike Murchison. I'm going to call out just a moment, John. I'm going to call out the next ten so they can begin a line up. You have Zach, you have Gratia Lopez Reyes, Maggie Valenzuela, just Seth Randall, Magdalena Pereda. Alyssa Tong. Andrew Mandu, Luciano, Lakisha Johnson, Paul working, and Maria Lopez. All right, John, you have the floor. Good evening, Vice Mayor, Councilmember, city manager and city staff. My name is John Edman. I'm the executive director of the Apartment Association of California Southern Cities. Well, my my members represent the free market, affordable housing providers. And I'm a resident in the city of Long Beach. I have participated in every step of this process since early 2021. Tonight, we are discussing remedies for a problem that has yet to be supported by data. The common theme throughout this process is lack of data. This vote will have an effect for years to come on housing investments in Long Beach. Currently, we pay relocation fee, which we are open to discussing in future based on inflation and other other matters. Substantial years. Why don't we have a box to check when we're doing a permit application? We can track tenant relocations with the staff report. There is a distinct distinction with a difference between an eviction and canceling Alys. The state clearly defines nobody has any ambiguity of what a substantial remodel is, and we know it when we see it. It's ripping out plumbing, redoing electrical, and keeping up with our aging housing stock. Throughout this process, we have not heard one example of a tenant displaced under something that is not covered under current state law. And if it was done outside of state law, there are remedies available to them today and they should be held accountable. Additionally, we are observing a chill effect in Long Beach for investment in Long Beach properties through this moratorium and unnecessary environment. Thank you. But thank you, John. And Mr. Clark, when we get to 90 seconds, you should intervene in managing this piece. We next have Matthew Buck, then Mike Murchison and then Zach Matthew. I thank you. Honorable Mayor and City Council. My name is Matthew Buck. I'm with the California Apartment Association. The staff report indicates no complaints have been received by the department on this issue zero. It's not because the city can't collect the data. It's easy to field complaints in the existing response base system. It's purely because there are no complaints regarding illegal upgrades. The Tenant Protection Act outlines specific criteria regarding substantial remodels to address an aging housing stock. The provisions in the law are not a loophole, but designed to encourage the maintenance and upkeep of the state's apartment homes. Over 70% of the housing in Long Beach was built before 1970. Your buildings need rehabilitation. Unnecessary regulations will deter needed upgrades and increase the cost to obtain housing. There's no evidence to support additional regulations are needed. We ask that the item be received and filed. Ensure your complaint based systems collecting data properly and increase education efforts to your residents. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Mike Murchison, the exacting grazier. Good evening, Vice Mayor, council members, city staff. I want to thank development services for taking the time over the past year and listening to everybody on both sides of this. Hopefully in 2022 we want to deal with tenant landlord issues. We've had enough in 2021, to be honest. You've also heard from everybody from the landlord side of things. The staff is basically figured out. There's been no there's been no data to substantiate what we've been discussing. None. So we have nothing factually to really fall back on. Number two, as said earlier, the state already has law about what a substantial remodel is. If you want to codify that for local here in the city, an ordinance by all means. But the state already has a law on it. As mentioned also, we have a very old housing stock here in Long Beach. What are we going to do to incentivize small property owners to basically come forward and improve their property? How are we going to do that if we're going to continue to hit them with exorbitant cost to make this all happen? Finally, the thing that bothers me probably the most is the cost of a RFP program. You heard earlier it's roughly two I think I heard 4 million. Eventually, development services, if they found the ability to pay for that, is going to pass that on to property owners. We can't pass that on to tenants. That's not a pass through costs. With 1482, you have a 5% raise increase annually plus CPI. You won't be able to pass through those additional costs. Keep that in mind. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next to Zach, then. Greasier than Maggie. You've had a lot of. You've got your glasses. Yes. Hi. My name is Zack and I'm a landlord. And I just want to tell you my story, which is this pandemic has basically run me into the ground. I'm having to work, too. I had to go back to school there and work two jobs to keep hold on to what I have. So when you guys add additional cost on us, it's not something that we can just afford. And just as a side note, my tenant is so I'm the government owes me $44,000 in unpaid rent and my tenant wants $10,000 bribe cash to cooperate with it because you guys put that stipulation that you have to cooperate. So I'm fighting like hell to hang on to what I have and adding more cost to us, more burdens is hard enough. Fall. I mean, I feel for these guys out here with the no eviction signs, but you guys have let 10,000 low cost units go away. You guys have let a bunch of Section eight go away. You guys, this is not a fault from the landlords. And this, for the most part, impacts only small landlords. And, you know, all you're going to get is a takeover from BlackRock, who's not gonna listen to you guys, all of them. They're gonna come in with their fancy lawyers and there's no chance for anybody then. So I'm asking you guys to reject this altogether. And lastly, when I can't afford when somebody can't afford to pay somebody to live somewhere else, they're just gonna start ripping out asbestos walls with that with the people still living there. Thank you. Next is Grecia, then Maggi, then Hyacinth. Good evening. Members of the council. My name is Graciela with RES. I'm the director of Leon's Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs in a Healthy Community and a member of the Housing Justice Coalition. First, I want to acknowledge the leadership of council members Cindy Allen and Julie Sano for taking proactive steps to address substantial remodel evictions. I also want to thank Council woman Mary Sunday House Vice Mayor Richard Richardson and Councilman Al Austin for taking the time to meet with members of the community to listen to our concerns around substantial remodeling. As you know, landlords are using substantial remodel as a reason to evict tenants from what are turning out to be minor repairs . Many tenants have asked for repairs for months or years in advance with no action. But with the hot housing market and the COVID 19 pandemic, landlords are using this loophole to take long term tenants out, make minor changes, and hike up the rent. For these reasons, we are in strong support of Option one as the only option that protects and unburdened Long Beach renters and prevents worsening homelessness in the city. We also support critical changes to option two, including an increase in permanent relocation assistance, adding temporary relocation assistance and adding affirmative defenses to evictions if landlords fail to notify the city or pay relocation. Finally, we ask the council to extend the eviction moratorium up to until the new ordinance goes into effect. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next is Maggie, then Hyacinth, and then Magnolia. Maggie. Good evening, Catherine. Sorry. Good evening, council members. My name is Maggie Venezuela, and I'm the organizer with Lane. I'm here to uplift across the whole story. She couldn't be here today. Rosa is a resident at Signal Hill. But she lived in Long Beach for three years. She was told to leave her unit where she was paying. 1500 dollars a month because the building was bought by a new owner and they were going to renovate the unit. She could not stay. She moved to single here, where now she pays 30 $200 a rent. She's a 76 year old woman who. Barely make ends meet as a care worker. Most of her family and friends are not here anymore. When she was evicted, she didn't know what to do. Or who to talk to. She didn't have any help. Her family and her children don't live here. She did everything by herself. She doesn't wish this on anyone. Currently she's behind two months and is having to worry about possibly being evicted and move again. When she thinks about the stress and frustration she went through to find a place in less than a month. It brings her heartache because she never imagined that for these reasons. We ask for your strong support for option one. To address the loophole. Around substantial remodel and ensure safe and affordable housing in our community. Thank you. Thank you. Next, we have Husain, then Dalia and then Elsa tung. Actually. Jasim Jasim. I. Good evening. Mayor and. The council. Members. It appears to me that Long Beach, the city of Long Beach, is no longer the affordable residential haven for middle to lower class. Income residents want to make a comfortable and safe, long term home with the never ending pandemic. It appears, though, that all. Predatory landlord landlords are on the. Alert to make themselves unjustly enriched. My very first apartment in Long Beach was in 2012. And even. Before I signed the contract, which by the way, I was not allowed to read, even though I asked for. I have experienced. Continuous forms of inhumane inhumanity. Violations of tenants rights and dehumanizing acts which go unchecked. And. That even includes false advertising. After surviving these various forms of degradation. I prevailed in court, but not with any help. Even though the city had come in and found. The errors. And necessary repairs were. Not. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Thank you. Next we have Magnolia, then Elsa and Andrew. There's double the times. There's an interpreter. Thank you. I'm not sure if we have another concert coming over to your third anniversary. If I keep working for the government, they'll say, Look at the unnecessary part. I can be a foreman because they're not political, though even then, it's roughly that level of socialism problem out there in a society that is astoundingly some government enterprise , along with this blossoming stuff, especially mental illness, profit areas playing on mental illness are killers. It's not fact. I like this. Are you and others like you? Listen, I thought you left. We went to an apartment. I said, you like it? I'm going to stay. In fact, I got it right out of L.A.. Maria Soccer one guy. Sebastian Palermo. Right long on a player for me. God, you're so physical. Mental capacity. There's a lot more than supporting me, going to persuade me that the Camorra to deliver, but they'll see the start of them and they're not. Enter. You go. I'm not going to do a lot of sport. Not for me. Going to look cheering. Yes, sir. Stackhouse on the stairs. Get on there and meet Elizabeth Racine. No, but I must say, you've been with the provisional. You know, the longest time was political. Mazzoli law's kind of protecting a lot of the local Adobe and other secular Israelis. Unless you left the remainder of the system either, even if monolithically not in the role of a citizen. So I must tell you that to start considering this option is going to respect one another. Last year's extension of which are luxury, are non-nuclear, but clearly not eliminate Ludmila substantial but more naturalistically step out of the Salahis. Say, what are the key thing I'm supposed to pilot a policy on? And so you can ask for attention. Good evening, council members. My name is Maccabi Tel Aviv and I'm a resident of District nine. I'm here because I am committed to doing whatever it takes to change the district, to change the way housing policies are made in our city. Substantial remodeling is a real problem in our city, and this loophole is being used as a tool for unjust eviction and displacement, specifically so that landlords can significantly raise rents. This impacts access to affordable housing in our city. I live in an unaffordable apartment that is infested with roaches. My landlord gave me one day's notice to move all my staff from the unit so they could fumigate. I was physically incapable of doing the move on my own and my husband and son work late. The landlord tried to increase my rent as a result and this has caused an enormous amount of stress. We cannot continue allowing landlords to take advantage of Long Beach renters. We need stronger policies in place that protect us from eviction and the lack of affordable housing in the city. Substantial remodel is another loophole in our housing system that puts renters at risk of evictions. We ask that you support option one, which will protect renters, eliminate substantial remodel as a just cause for eviction, and ensure that we have a fair process for repairs. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Ailsa Chang, then Andrew and then Lucretia. Good evening. Council Members Ailsa Chang, Long Beach, Forward District seven resident and actually, yes, a landlord in a different jurisdiction. Thank you Councilmember sorrow and Allen for your leadership in the age of COVID Delta and now all Macron evictions equals death. Council members, if you don't want that on your conscience, then adopt critical improvements tonight. First, extend the substantial remodel eviction moratorium all the way until the new ordinance goes into effect. Second, adopt option one, which is what the renter majority ultimately needs. Look, if that's not in the cards tonight, then combine and amend options two and three with the following six specific changes. Number one, revise the definition of substantial remodel to a 90 day threshold. Number two, increase permanent relocation assistance aligned with L.A. County's reload program, which, for instance, provides $16,000 to a lower income household displaced from a two bedroom unit. Three Add temporary relocation assistance, also aligned with the county. Four Strike the word intentionally regarding the civil fine. Five At a private right to action for a tenant to sue with for civil penalty and attorney's fees. This is simply a deterrent. And six, an affirmative defenses. To unlawful detainers. If the landlord fails to notify the city of a substantial removal eviction or fails to pay permanent relocation assistance. Stop evictions now. Up. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Andrew and then Lucretia Johnson and then Paul working. Hello. My name is Andrew with the Long Beach Tenants Union, which is comprised of the 64 Street Daisy and Orange Resistances. Over the past two years, you've have gotten to know their faces, their families and their struggles. Most importantly, you've gotten to know their fearlessness, their unwavering commitment to do what is needed to move you all to act. We saw this before the pandemic when adopting the home for the holidays eviction moratorium during the pandemic, when advocating for a tenant anti-harassment policy and key budget acts such as housing, navigators and right to counsel. And for the past few months, asking to remove substantial remodel as a just cause reason for eviction. While the tactics these tenants have organized and led, such as visits to your homes, are unorthodox, they were effective in passing an unprecedented amount of tenant protections and building the strongest renter power this city has ever seen. This brings us here today where we are asking you all, especially those of you who call yourselves our allies, to stand with us and adopt option one to remove substantial remodel as a just cause for eviction and establish a renovation administration program. Furthermore, we ask you to combine options two and three and allow the right for tenants to choose either temporary relocation, including maintaining the rights to tenancy at current rent or permanent relocation. The profits of a few shouldn't be prioritized over the lives of many. We hope you all stand on the side of history and believe yourselves that housing is a human right. Thank you. Next is Lucretia Johnson. Is Lucretia here? Okay, then Paul working, then Maria Lopez. Paul, just a moment. I'm going to call the next ten speakers to line up. You have Antonia, then Katie, Deonna, Marlene Alvarado, Paul Abad, Paula Abad, Liana Noble, Jordan. When Karen Reside, Karen was Ric and Harvey Holt and Christine Schachter. So, Paul, you're up. Hi. My name is Paul working. I like to think that city council members give me a chance to speak. Right. I am currently a resident of District one. I am speaking for everyone who has gone through what I'm going through right now. This is just a few of the many issues that are experiencing the current time and our residents. We have no fire alarms. We have no keys to get in and out and black mold on the ceilings and walls, including mushrooms growing from the ceilings. Zero security. Very, very strange. Super dangerous at night. Not hardly any lighting. So when we asked for repairs, we responded to the terror level and responded by giving us our eviction notice. What brings me here today is to ask you to adopt option one to remove substantial. Remodel just for just cause of eviction and establish and renovation administration program. And that's. Doesn't go through. I'm not sure what my friends and myself are going to have, what options it will have left. So that's it. Thank you. Next is Maria Lopez, then Antonia and Katie. Marie, are you here? I think. Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Go for it. Why not, Chef? Good evening. My name is Maria Lopez. I'm a proud tenant and District one and a daughter of a small landlord in District eight. In my family, we agree that evictions are not solutions. So we ask you to decide on option one all rights that a rent sorry, a rental administration program would alleviate so much stress and alleviate so much stress off of you all two. But first and foremost, we ask that if that is not an option, that you combine option two and three along the lines of also extending the eviction moratorium until the end of February 2022. In addition to supporting my colleagues that have already included that in the definition of substantial remodel, to include the work that would require tenants of at least 90 days. To be more specific on what I would as a person who has been evicted and displaced through the legal system, relocation assistance was not offered to me at the time, and so I would highly encourage you all to look at L.A. County's model and adopt that as well. In that same note, I would it would be for permanent and temporary relocation assistance. And the most important, as someone who has gone through the unlawful detainer process, is that you all add an affirmative defense to unlawful detainers if and when the landlord fails to pay low or fails to notify the city of subsequent. Francisco, thank you. Thank you. Next we have Antonia, then Katie, then Marlene. What I noticed at the last minute. Antonia, that an assistant to the center like. Good evening, everyone. My name is Antonia from Residential 64. I presented Bogota Hoy example, and it was our episode that I found the most by my family. Even though we had a lack of work and we had to use our savings and even though we faced the pandemic, we were able to pay rent month after month. Gear up the Alaska patrol that CNN and don't let on what I thought the contrary is a local sport of the modern nation. I want you to please once more close the loophole on the moratorium on evictions once and for all. And we knew then that if you show them a keen interest in a center, cuatro durante la Pandemia Mendoza Ramone, L.A. Apartamento is. The owner of the building on 540 64th Street, essentially remodel the building's apartments and without the permits from the city. Cinematography. Is that almost an acquired antenna? You know up I have autism that I haven't seen less protection in the society. Without taking into account that we were in the quarantine and the workers were coming in without protections. And I know that only percent of myself rent. And then rent went up 8%. Durante la pandemia. During the pandemic. That was Corberan and I was in that red already though. Today I was up. What about if I'm into. What I also charge for water when there is no and a device to measure the water consumption per apartment unit. That is in parking. Lot. We pay $100 for parking. And other than most here in Colorado, Colorado, those million dollars for a camera. So in total, we're paying $2,000 for a one bedroom. And I was doing your suicide moratoria that I'm one of the lucky owners of our water. So the owners are using the moratorium, the remodeling as a on their own favor. Let's be look at bong and poquito that the end zone some Angelinos camels that oh but I love going to see thermals get them in Athens you know. So we ask you please pay attention to us the tenants that are being able to pay month after month. Please pay attention to us. Thank you. One analogies. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have Katie, then Marlene, then Paula. Hi, I'm Katie. Emma. And although I won't be helped by the measures tonight, many of my neighbors will. 17 specifically units that would be saved by the difference between a 30 day threshold and. A 60 or 90 day. Threshold. And some of them are here, including Pat in a wheelchair, Daryn, with a walker. These are people. Who will be immediately impacted by the difference between a 30 day and a 60 day threshold of how long the work is going to take. That's an important thing. And 90 days. Would be even better. Rental relocation assistance will be great to have that in there. But. For 40 $500. If you're moving, if you're kicked out of a 440 $500 house. You're not going to get. Into another one without three month's rent on hand. So. It's just a random number that doesn't. Look at the reality of the situation. And there's no. Support at all for temporary. Relocation. So those are some. Things that would need to be addressed to make now the option to stronger. Option one is still the goal and hopefully you will continue working on that. Until you come up with the money. But in the meantime, option to could make a. Really big difference in incorporated with option three. There are important things in there that can really help save tenants, keep. Them in their homes, and still. Allow landlords the option of providing that temporary relocation. And bringing people back. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Marlene and then Paula and Liana. Hello, my name is Marlene Alvarado. I actually am a landlord. Not in this year, but another. And I always think it's just and fair and. Humane. To extend the. Substantial remodeling. Eviction moratorium until the new ordinance goes into effect, which may be after February 28, 2022, as proposed by the item number two, adopt up option one to remove substantial remodeling as a just cause for eviction and establish renovate of administrative program administered by the Department of Services. The Development Service Department Combine and amend Option two and three, which is currently written. Fall to protect fail to protect the renter majority. We urge the City. Council to make the following critical fixes to option two. And three. Revise the definition of substantial remodeling to. Include work that would require a tenant to vacate for at least 90 days and increase permanent relocation. Assistance at temporary relocation assistance. Eliminate intentional requirement for civil fine. Increase Civil five $15,000. Should be the minimum fine, not the maximum add private rights of action, but time has expired. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Next we have Paula, then Liana, then Jordan. Paula here. I'm not. I'm party. Is Paula here? Now, Lianna, is Lianna here? I'm on Leona. And then Jordan. And then Karen. My name's Lana. Noble. I'm here tonight as the interim volunteer director of Leave. Right. You've said tonight, Virgin, right from the city, that one. Of your concerns as elected. Officials is data. You know, my question is, why isn't the city collecting the data that is related to the majority of our residents who happen to be renters? 60% of the residents of this city are renters. In neighborhoods where I live and close to where I live. Renters are 90% of the renters. So there are entire huge areas of our city where the residents are renters. And they are here telling you again and again. That there is suffering. There are loopholes in this ordinance. We're glad that we made the progress we have, but we have shared with you specific changes. Modifications. That are doable. So if you're going to put it on our shoulders as renters to fight for fair housing, then you need to make these changes. So when we go to court, we have a chance to win. That's what we're asking for. You make changes so we can get past expired. Have to go to court. Thank you. Next, Jordan. When Karen resigned, Karen was Rick Jordan. Good evening. My name is Jordan Wynn, resident of District two and member of the Housing Justice Coalition. I am here in support, strong support of adopting option one, removing removing substantial role models, a just cause for eviction, establishing a renovation administrative program administered by the Development Services Department. This is what our tenants really need, and it's a common sense policy that other municipalities have already adopted. Liana put it best We need to start collecting the data, but truly, do you want the data? Here we are. Living, breathing data. Here in the audience we are complaining. We are the tenants who have been fighting and continuing the hard work of attending the past sessions, of telling you these stories again and again. Again. How many times you have to hear that tenants need help in the city and it's not without insistence from advocates to collect data in our city. As the report said, 879 multi-unit developments filed for substantial rehabilitation, meaning that thousands potentially of individuals and families affected. Let's be honest, this data issue goes beyond tonight's decision. Long Beach needs to act proactively to aid tenants who've been coming here and telling you they need help for years. Does the city want to remain blind to the issues of the majority of its population without the support of its city and the law behind them? Tenants are scared to report, often feeling powerless and don't know their rights. And of course, landlords won't be reporting something that they're doing under the table. Who shows up? Tenants show up because housing is a human right. The cost of this program pales in comparison to the need that we have in our city. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next is Karen reside in Karen was Rick then Harvey Holt. Good evening. My name. Is Karen Reside and I'm the. President of the Long Beach Gray. Panthers. And every day. I get 2 to 3 seniors that come into the senior center. With letters from their landlords. They're increasing their. Lats. Or they're giving them 30 day. Eviction notices illegally. Sent them immediately to legal aid to help them fight this. So we know the landlords. We do have some data. We know that there. Are buildings that are. Evicting all of their tenants to do remodeling. So we have data there. And a lot of those. Buildings housed seniors. The landlords pick on the seniors because they think the seniors. Won't complain and won't. Fight it. We participated in the process and we support the Housing Justice Coalition recommendations. But we wanted. Added extra provision for seniors. Seniors, I can't tell. You the number of seniors. That have had to move out of state. That used to come to the senior center and they're now all gone. So I know at least 40 the people that I ate lunch with had to move out of state because they had. Unreasonable increases in their rent. We have to collect the data. We know that landlords, not all landlords are bad, but there's a lot that aren't good. So and this causes undue stress on seniors and probably have cost lives. Thank you. So Harvey's next. And then. And then. Excuse me, Karen was Rick and then Harvey. But before you go, Karen, why you went to make your way? I want to call it the last five speakers Michael Lapointe, Daniel Sherwood, Mary Duong, Winston de Laurier and Vilma. Okay, so, Karen, you're up. Thank you for having me here. I love you. Nice. I was here a couple months ago, and I wanted to, first of all, say a thank you with these ordinance amendments. And I hope most of them get taken. Four voted for. I have a little difficulty sometimes with my words. And so please excuse excuse me. One of the things I wanted to talk about was, you know, it's what's talked about if major. You know, increasing, they're making them better and so forth and so on. And that's what our owner wants to do. But they're not doing it to make it nice for us. They're making it more expensive so that other people come in after us. And as much as $1,000 more for the same place I've been living where I live for 20 years. And my very nice landlord. Except that she did. She got older and she sold it. So now a company holds it and they do not have the same heart. And they as she did. And she now. More times expire. What? Oh, is that all? I'll finish your sentence. She occasionally would increase the rent, but not every year. Our new deck per people are there two years and I've had to over $100 each. Thank you. Increase. Thank you. Next is Harvey Hope and Christine Schachter. Hello. My name's Harvey Holt. I work 56 hours a week. I'm 37. Excuse me. You have to put on an hour. I thought I'd take it off right here. I live with my parents until this march. And I lived them in a one bedroom. In a bedroom with my wife and my son also that I could save money to buy a property. And I bought a four unit property here in Long Beach. I went to Centennial High in Compton. And what I learned from being a property owner is not always about all you. You increasing things to make money, you're increasing things to improve it, to keep it, to keep up with inflation. So like, for example, the place up by I did a one bedroom for me and my wife and kids are moving into contractors wanting a $40,000 to remodel a one bedroom, 600 square foot apartment like f the F . I had to redo the lady door unit next to mine. Like I would have to recoup that cost. And even over what, seven, eight years, I still wouldn't recoup it. And she only she only pays 900. But I'll replace the windows, I replaced the plumbing, and I didn't have to displace anyone to replace the windows and plumbing . But if I had to redo that unit, which eventually I will like, I have to recoup that cost. So I think. Don't you think, oh, we want to put people out. No, it's like, yo, I work 56 hours a week. I think you have to let me at least recoup my money. Thank you. Next is Christine Schachter, then Michael Lapointe, then Daniel Sharwood. And 30 $200. Thank you, sir. For 30 $200. Thank you. All right, Christine, Christina, respectfully, we need to just respect the process. Thank you. All right. Christina. Christine Schecter with Christine. Season of Realtors. Yeah, thank you. Representing about 13,000 members here locally in August, our coalition submitted a written request to the. For further information on the scope and impact of the eviction problem related to renovations, which people have discussed here tonight attempting to review this since July all bids. His response was the Housing Neighborhood Services Bureau has not received any complaints from any individuals regarding substantial remodels. Beginning in August of last year, almost a year and a half ago, state laws, AB 30, 88, SB 91 and AB 32 extended just cause of perfection evictions to all properties under AB 1482, including single family homes and condos , and prevented termination of tenancy based on the intent to demolish or substantially remodel the residential real property unless to comply with Stevie Code. Sorry, I'm having a hard time breathing through spring 2022 and next year property owners are required to take steps in compliance with state law to demonstrate their mean good faith efforts to seek rental assistance for a tenant they've worked with. Additionally, this work is currently suspended in L.A. County due to emergency procedures through spring of next year. We urge you to consider the ramifications of new bureaucracy and unwieldy programs and urge you to look to current tenant assistance, Iraq funding and how to implement current policy. Thank you. Thank you. Next is Michael Lapointe, then Daniel Sherwood, the married one. I don't know. Okay. We don't see Michael. Next is Daniel. Good evening, City Council. My name is Daniel Sherwood. I've been a resident of Long Beach for 35 years. So what I know about Long Beach is I love the city, and I know that the city has prided itself on diversity and quality of life. But I also know that as we have an awful homeless situation, mental illness and violence on our streets. And we have a lack of affordable rents. We too, went through the same thing. A company came in and bought our 27 unit and a 24 unit. We share a pool. The first year, they evicted 90% of the residents in Obispo for substantial remodel. So the rest of us that hung tight. We were on pins and needles. We never knew whether we were going to get to stay or whether we're going to get to go. And that's that's not a great way to live. And so I concur with everybody here tonight. It's an awful place to be in. So what did we get when they revamped these buildings and made them high end apartment buildings? We went from 1000 to 20 to 50 for a one bedroom. We went from 1250 to 20 to 50 for a two bedroom or 2450 for a two bedroom. Our pool we had the heater was taken out, the security system was removed. And the elevators, they're not painted. The maintenance is awful and your time is up. It is deplorable. Thank you. Thank you. Our final three speakers, Mary Duong, Winston and Vilma. Mary. Good evening, senior counsel. My name is Mary Yoon. I am a pastor and a faith rooted organizer with Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice. I want to say thank you to CASA member Alan and CASA member Sarah for your leadership in bringing this item up. I myself was impacted by substantial remodel or eviction when I was in graduate school. I remember that my landlord never had a conversation with me regarding compensation for relocation expenses. It was stressful to be in graduate school and to work at the same time, and it was more stressful and more overwhelming, like when you lost your affordable housing. And I can imagine families with children going through that right now during this pandemic. I think we need to address that. There is an unequal power relationship between landlords and tenants. Substantial remodel as a just cost makes tenants more vulnerable to eviction at any moment and be at the mercy of their landlords. And this power imbalance creates the conditions for power abuse, as we have heard in many testimonies tonight. So to shift this power imbalance, I believe that option one is the best solution because it will remove substantial remodel as a just cause and also it will provide oversight to landlords so that responsible repairs can be made and also affordable housing is ensure for tenants. In my Christian tradition, the prophets teach that God identifies yourself with the vulnerable in society. So I ask that the CD Council we vote on option one to support our tenants as well. Thank you. Next is Winston then Vilma. Hello, folks. My name is Winston Deloria. I'm live in the six councilwoman Sara's district. Just have a few things to say. First of all, I strongly urge the council to adopt option one in the event that option two is selected. I would very strongly urge even any any decision is made. I believe the moratorium should remain in place until it can be implemented. I think to do otherwise just is inviting landlords to evict tenants preemptively. Secondly, I believe the 60 day notice well, I actually believe that was increased from 90 day notice. I believe that's a good move. Relocation assistance, I believe, should be increased to match the L.A. County guidelines. And then the the other point I want to make here is just very briefly, we're not just talking about individuals, right. And you're talking about individual families. You know, we hear a lot about the free market solution here. The free market solution to this is poor people. Well, the kids get roommates with, you know, four people to a studio apartment and working families moved to Victorville. I think our communities have a right to exist and we're going to fight for that right to exist. Thank you. Thank you. Our final speakers, Velma. Why not have this mean armrest, Wilma. Wouldn't he? My name is Wilma. De la Assistenza and I sent a Quattro this reconnoiter. From District nine residency of the 64th Green. It must a and moratorium control of this handover. We want the eviction moratorium to be extended. As a serious lawyer, the suspension. And the look on the substantial remodeling is closed. I mean. Yes, almost. Canceled the dance. Performances. Well, so tired of so many friends. Apathy that prevent. Other of the pregnant men that don't have to get the the most get back. I've seen a lot of the fucking. Scenes of this were the first they told us they gave us a notice that we had to pay $100 parking. I mean, I've seen parking. Almost, but do not say well enough. Or do not no check. You know, by. Threatening us that if we park the car for a few minutes or even overnight, they will take the car away from us. And then what has to happen? Know you can help out another guy. We beg you. Please pay attention to us and do something for us. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes public comment. We'll go to Councilwoman Allen and the maker of the motion. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I want to first start by thanking Oscar, Christopher Patrick and everyone at DVS for their hard work and insights on this issue. This item today is exactly what we asked for back in July, and I really appreciate all the time and the outreach that was spent on putting this together. I also want to recognize my co-sponsor on the original, original item, Councilwoman Sorrow and the Cosigners Vice Mayor Richardson and Councilwoman Zendejas for their partnership and support. And we definitely wouldn't be here today without all of you. I also want to take a moment to recognize all the tenant and property groups and individuals who reached out to my office and participated in the process. With the city and voice their questions and concerns. So thank you for your opinions. Thank you for your experiences. All of this really matters to me. So. Diving into this item. I appreciate the policy options presented today. My staff recommendation, I would like to pursue option one and I do support creation of a rap. But due to the city's fiscal situation, it doesn't seem possible at this time. Creating a way to manage projects was the purpose of the initial policy directive, and we still need to find a way that allows for units to be upgraded without displacing residents. But current budget projections will not make this immediately feasible. We need more time and planning to identify and allocate the kind of funding for Iraq. This option also takes a very long time to implement, and it would take at least one year or longer to develop the program and hire staff. I think there are actions that we can take here now that will make a difference similar to the SAS recommendation. I support moving forward with a hybrid solution that contains option three and elements of option two with modifications. These are things that we can do today at lower costs to the city and landlords increasing their relocation assistance to 4500, it would be very beneficial. This would provide a lot of relief for residents. And this figure is significantly less than the L.A. County relocation amounts. So I do support this option, and I'd like this to be 4500 or two months for rent, whichever is greater. Is that something that we can do? Yes. That's a change we could make. Okay. And then from option two, I support, including numbers three, four and five and removing numbers one and two. So establishing a fine for landlords who violate our city's just cause ordinance, I think, is a strong deterrent against bad actors. Additionally, providing a 90 day notice to vacate also helps tenants better manage and remodel a better manager remodel process. I'm very excited about point number four, particularly the data collection aspect of it. I think that it's just what we need to better understand the extent of substantial remodel related displacement in our city. So I would like to make the motion and move forward with a hybrid solution that contains a modified option. Three. And points three, four and five from option two. Thank you. Next thing I saw, a cup of jersey. Okay. There are also a few things that I'd like to request in addition to that. Could we include language and option three that clarifies the relocation benefit disbursement information? Is it a lump sum or will payments be divided and when will the payments be issued? So we can include all of those items. But if you have specific direction as to what your preferences are, you would need to let us know because I don't think we have a specific staff recommendation on. On exactly how the disbursement works. Okay. And I definitely would like to hear from my colleagues. And then I do have a call. I do have one last question. I know what's going to be lost. But we heard that there's been no data on substantial remodel evictions. And I know in your report you say while the claims are valid, it is possible that the displacements are concentrated in certain buildings. So you're saying they're likely valid, but but why is there no data on this effort on this? So we believe one of the most important things in front of council is to create a mandatory reporting requirement for a substantial remodel. Today, there is no reporting requirement. So what happens is a landlord within their rights issues a non-judicial, you know, notice to vacate a 60 day notice. And if the tenant complies with the notice that's not forwarded to the city, it's not forwarded to the courts. It's it's not shared with any third party. So it's not that there is no data. It's that there is not sufficient data that the city is party to. Because we don't currently have any right to that data or a way to access that data. So what we did was look at indirect evidence. We looked at building permits. There was some information about, you know, sheriffs enforced evictions, but that does not those are indirect indicators. That's not the direct information which we don't have today. Okay. Thank you. Next is Councilwoman Ciro. Thanks, Vice Mayor. I also want to reiterate my thanks to staff for their hard work in bringing this item back and as well as to all of our advocates and tenants and property owners and advocates on their comment and feedback on this item. And I will second councilmember and I want to thank Councilmember Allen for her leadership on this item. And we'll second it. But I have some friendly amendments, some friendly to make on the motion. I like to make a friendly to adding option 2.1. I think revising the definition of the statute remodeled include work that would require a tenant to vacant for at least 60 days as opposed to the 30. Is a strong policy that allows good faith landlord to renovate their property at their discretion and provide some protection for tenants as well. So I'd like to hear from my colleagues on this. And the other is I would like to amend option 2.32 rather saying fine up to 15,000 is to start at 15,000 and to strike out intentionally. And lastly, while I understand that option one at the moment is physically, physically not possible, but I like to ask that we get a report back with a year's worth of data, a substantial remodel related eviction. I think that this will give us a better sense on what the situation is in Long Beach, and that the report also include possible additional resources for funding the wrap in updated cost figures as well. And that concludes my comment. Thank you. That was a request for three friendlies. Did you want to respond now? Do you want to wait? You know, if I could, I wait and just hear from my colleagues. All right, Councilman Mongo. Thank you. I want to thank everyone who came out tonight on both sides of the issue. I did listen to and really took some notes on some of the things that were said. But when Karen and I don't I don't want to say her last name incorrectly, but caring who came to the dais and really talked about how her small landlord sold and a big company bought the building. I think that more and more of that is happening because when I talk to people who have the opportunity to invest and potentially keep an original property and move and buy a property and then rent out their old property or invest and buy a multi-unit, they're very discouraged because of the complexities of being a landlord. And with each and every day, it gets more and more complex and there's more and more struggles for them to know and understand. And more things that could put them under and make their investment a just a money pit of frustration. You already have the risks of a tenant not being able to pay rent and or a tenant or a natural disaster like we've had where you would be put in a position to not receive rent for long periods of time where you may still be required to pay that mortgage and go through the processes and paperwork to get those requirements. So and while I'm very supportive of a solution that makes sense for all. I think that one of the things that we do need to talk about as a community is that if we want. Individuals who live locally to own the properties that our neighbors are renting. Instead of these big companies and corporations. We need to talk about what we can do to make it easy on them. Because the types of people who don't raise rent are your neighbors. When your neighbors own the property you live in, they're the ones who are the best landlords because they're the ones who live in Long Beach and they care about you. These big companies aren't aren't the way of the way we want to go. And so I think with each policy, I don't know if there's a way to differentiate who the policies apply to. But I think that the best case scenario for us as a city is that the larger percentage of the housing stock that's owned locally by neighbors, the better position all our renters would be in. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Price. So thank you for the discussion and thanks for everyone who came out especially. I want to thank staff for undergoing this huge process. And Patrick, you've done amazing work on it, so I appreciate that. I appreciate the comments from my colleagues and I support I'm going to support this item. And Councilwoman Allen's motion, I'm not sure about the friendlies that the one that I personally don't want to see in there is 2.1. But again, I want to hear my colleagues thoughts on that. But that wasn't part of the initial motion by Councilwoman Allen. And I just I don't believe it's necessary based on the staff presentation that we have received and some of the areas of of. Input that staff has highlighted from the community meetings. But other than that, I'm supportive of the motion and I look forward to hearing from my colleagues. Thank you, Councilmember Surana. Thank you. I have a follow up on Councilwoman Sorrells friendly, and I'm not sure if that's been accepted yet, but I'm all for getting the data as was referenced by everyone here tonight. But my concern is the cost. And if staff knows how we would pay for that, I see. I think there's potentially a large concern that either be borne by the city. Or the landlords through fees. Do you have any immediate reaction to that? So that's not our intention. Council Member So we have to work through some security issues, but theoretically this would be a Google form that landlords would have a log in to. They would log in, note the location, address the unit number, the landlord's contact information and upload a copy of the notice and that would fulfill their reporting requirement. So if their cost is not zero, but we would anticipate it not to be a substantial cost. Okay. I think I understand that answer, that we could lessen the cost due to technology, but we would still have cost in notifying landlords or through any program like this. There are some costs. But I think I'm hearing you say that is not substantial to what you're looking at. That's that's correct. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Arango. Thank you. Rates there in you know, for purposes of transparency, I have met with people regarding the the issue regarding the this item here. And I looked at it and asked, well, isn't there like a fourth option that could be together? And I guess the fourth option is sort of their presenta right now, as Councilmember Allard has put together in terms of putting items two and three together. Obviously, we had a budget presentation earlier today. Option one would not be feasible at all. I mean, it's just impossible for us to be able to finance any kind of new program through the city if it's, you know, worth $2 million or even more. I do support the friendly that were brought forward recently with the council member. So I think that getting data is very important and I think staff would be able to work it out. And so I am very supportive of the friendlies as well to have, you know, the make of the motion would accept the friendly. Perfectly good with that as well. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Austin. Thank you. I know I was a little torn on this particular item from the very beginning because I didn't feel like the data was there to actually support the need for a policy. But after hearing from public comment, there's obviously a great deal of concern in the community about this this issue, which obviously we all hear behind this day. I think our city staff, we have an interest in keeping people housed. Is the morals, the ethical thing to do? One point that came out earlier from staff's report is 80% of our housing stock in the city was is over 30 years old. And that's something that that's a fact that we can't be lost on. We know that there as a result, there will be investments. We should be encouraging property owners to invest in their properties because we don't want to be a city that encourages blight or subpar living conditions for our residents. That said, I do think that this this item or this information that's on the floor is is a balanced motion. It makes a lot of sense. I do have questions about the friendly in terms of 2.3. And the question is more for the city attorney in terms of does it start at 15,000 or does it max at 15,000 or. Is it is it incumbent upon this body right now to set set that that that that that ceiling or floor for record it is councilmember out and you'd be giving. Future Superior Court judges guidance on what they can and can't do. And I think, as everyone knows currently as written, the fines for intentional violation could be anywhere between zero and 15,000. The friendly would force a judge to levy a fine of 15,000 and up. And as the friendly, at least I heard there was no maximum limit on on a fine that a judge might impose. And it's purely within your discretion to do it either way. And can can staff give us some some direction as to how we arrived at that at number two. As a as a floor or as a max. Was that an arbitrary number or. It's not a legally required number to that. To that extent, it may be somewhat arbitrary, but I'm guessing, and I don't think any of us can quite recall where it came from, we probably lifted it from another ordinance somewhere in the state that imposes a similar penalty for similar conduct, but I can't say for sure. Okay. Well, I'm supportive of the motion and I'm I'm a little a little ambivalent on on 2.3 the friendly but I. We'll be open to hear from the maker of the motion and my colleagues on that. Thank you, Councilwoman Zendaya's. Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you, Councilwoman Allen and Councilwoman Sorrell, for bringing this very, very important item forward and for your leadership on this. I know it's been a long road to getting here, and I just want to make sure that I let everyone know how important you are to this process from both sides of the coin. I just want to tell you how much we appreciate you coming out here and voicing your opinions and speaking for your community. So especially on this very, very important item. Myself as a renter, I'm always looking out for for renters to be able to live in a safe and and clean and updated environment. So that's always going to be important to me as a renter. I absolutely support the item that Councilwoman Allen has brought forward. I think that Councilmember Warren said it right. This is option number four, kind of like. So I think that a combination of that is really good. Another thing that I have heard from a lot of my residents is that the need for maybe asking for friendly in extending the moratorium that we have right now until this ordinance is is complete. And I'm hoping that you might be able to consider that and hoping that this ordinance can come back in 60 days. Thank you. I have to go to you because you're cute, Councilwoman Mongo. I guess my question is for Steph. I understand the idea of like a Google form, but one of the things that I think is really important is how are we going to notify landlords of the requirement to use the Google form? If no one knows, they need to do it. Sure. So we do have a productive relationship with the various apartment owners associations, whether that's the California Apartment Owners Association, Small Property Owners Association and others. So that would be the starting point, not the ending point, but that would be the starting point for communicating with landlords. And then those that have email addresses associated with their business license. We would also be providing them a notification in that way. So that would be the starting point. But we would find whatever additional ways we could communicate with them, barring substantial cost. What percentage of those that have business licenses have email addresses associated? I don't have that information. And then furthermore, to be a landlord in the city, you don't need to have a business license, if only if it's of a certain number of units or more. Is that accurate? So just so we're clear, a large percentage of landlords might not be notified. That's a concern if we want really good data. So I guess I would request that there's an option for a tenant to put in information that then we would be able to reach the landlord and get additional information so that if a landlord is unaware that a tenant could at least bring it to our attention, just give more complete data. But I recognize that that creates another set of challenges. Just some just some food for thought. I'm supportive of the item on the floor as it stands. I don't know that I could be open to the friendlies that have come before. I would love to pass something tonight with the support of the full council. I think Councilman Allen has done a considerable amount of work on this, and I think that the motion that she brought is very thoughtful and I would be supportive of that, and I hope that we get to see that on the floor as a final vote. Thank you. Thank you. I'll add my comment before going back to Councilwoman Allen. We've come a long, long way. And I know that folks have come here advocating predominantly to positions position one or no action at all. And I just want to remind folks that, you know, it was a couple of years ago, you know, and I've been participating in council meetings since 2010, and I remember the downtown planning fight and all of those things. Long Beach is in a significantly different place where there was no relocation assistance. And I think Andrew mentioned going back to home for the holidays made significant progress. There won't be, based on the comments of the council, what you hear an option one is not feasible from a financial standpoint. The council is not ready to go there. And and I think it's important to note that there are what's been presented in front of us does offer significant advancement in terms of, you know, relocation assistance increased in terms of, you know, the the fine you know, we've talked about slumlords in the city. We've talked about it. There's a big distinct difference between big companies or small companies or slumlords or people who are just trying to be good landlords. And having that fine, I think, is a clear distinction. If you break the law, there is a penalty. And there are you know, there are good things that are here. So while it is not heading toward option number one, I think what Councilwoman Allen is presenting, I think it's balance and will continue the conversation. And those are my thoughts. I see the city attorney is keyed up. Yeah. Thank you. Vice Mayor, just before it goes back to Councilmember Allen, there's a couple of questions that. She had asked a long time ago now that I want to close the loop on. The first is actually first is something that councilmembers and day has just said. I think it was a friendly to extend the prohibition on evictions until we get some final action on these changes. That's always been my intention. And in fact, that I. Brought back this extension on the prohibition, you know, without any specific direction from council to do so. Because I thought in July it was pretty clear that the intention of the council was put a moratorium on evictions until we. Take final action. So for all the members of the audience and behind the dais, there's been a lot of confusion about that. And I apologize for the role I played. February 28th is an arbitrary date. If we can't get something done by February. 28th, it's my full intention to bring back an extension. But February 28th, I think, gives us plenty of time to get something done. And it looks like consensus is building right now. So I intend to bring something. Back for formal adoption by you all behind the dais well in advance of that date. And at the same time. I would bring back something then. Terminating the prohibition on evictions if you take final action at the same time. They're meant to go at the same time, if that makes sense. And then in response to Councilmember Allen's questions regarding relocation payments currently currently the Long Beach Municipal Code requires the relocation payment to be made 15 days no later than 15 days after the notice of tenancy termination is delivered, and it is required to be paid in full at that time. I think that's. Responsive to a responsive to a question you asked a while back. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Allen. Okay. I just thank you, my colleagues, for. For all of your feedback. So that's great to hear that, um, that, that could be extended until we figure all of this out. The moratorium. I'm all about collecting data. And, and then with regards to Council member Austin's. Ask about 2.3. I think the $15,000 is I think we should have a have a. A number on that. I don't think that there should be no limit. And so I like to keep that as it is then. So it sounds like this is the big question is, is 2.1. So I'm hearing yes and no. And so I guess, councilman. Sorry, my ask would be, do you want to make a substitute motion? And we vote on that outside of this. But but I think that I'd like to keep my motion the way that it is. And then we can if we want to make a substitute motion outside of that and vote, then I'm okay with that, too. Yeah. I like to make a substitute motion to at least have the report back on a year's worth of data. I think that was it. Exactly. Okay. Yeah, that's exciting. Yes. And Counsel, just so we're all clear in terms of the report, that would be it. It would come slightly more than a year later because we would wait until the ordinance actually became effective and then an entire year of data was collected and then some. Amount of time to report back. Yes. I think so. So we're on the main motion with a number of the friendlies accepted. So do we need to restate that or can we go to the vote? I'm clear on what it is, but maybe we should restate. Sure. When you said a number of friendlies. Except that I only have that there's one or maybe two. So if you don't mind overstated, the motion on the floor is to adopt sub sections three, four and five from option two. To adopt options three or four or $500 for relocation payment or two months rent, whichever is greater. Report back staff is to report back in a little over a year with the first year's worth of data. And then the last would be direction for me to bring back an extension of the moratorium if necessary, so that it doesn't. Expire before you take final action. Right. Right on. Right. Members, please cast your vote. And I'm not queued up, so I need to say yes. As mayor, are you and I? I'm not sure that I. Motion is carried. Thank you. The next item we have is 35. That item required two votes. Oh, two votes. So we need to do this again. Councilwoman Ellen. That's one price and councilman zero. Emotion is great. And trying to cue cue into my own here, taking some time. Okay, let's go to item 35.","Recommendation to adopt ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by amending Chapter 8.102 to extend the prohibition on termination of certain lawful residential tenancies through February 28, 2022; declaring the urgency thereof; and declaring that this ordinance shall take effect immediately, read and adopt as read. (Citywide) (Emergency Ordinance No. ORD-21-0039)","Here is a concise summary of the key points from the presentation:

The agenda item was to consider options for addressing substantial remodel evictions in Long Beach, including:

Option 1 - Create a Tenant Habitability Program (estimated $2 million annual cost) to oversee substantial remodels 
Option 2 - Modify the existing Just Cause ordinance in several ways
Option 3 - Increase permanent relocation assistance payment to $4,500 per household

After extensive public comment from tenants, landlords, and advocates, the City Council passed a hybrid approach combining elements of Options 2 and 3:

- Increase permanent relocation assistance to $4,500 or two months' rent, whichever is greater
- Establish a civil fine of up to $15,000 for landlords who violate the Just Cause ordinance
- Require 90-day notice to tenants instead of 30 days for substantial remodels
- Require landlords to notify the city of substantial remodel evictions for data tracking
- Request a staff report back in over a year with data on substantial remodel evictions

The Council did not adopt Option 1 to create a new Tenant Habitability Program, citing budget constraints. The eviction moratorium related to substantial remodels will also be extended until the new ordinance takes effect.",0.8409090909090909,"Your role is to reason deeply about the substantive meaning and logical flow of information in each presentation first, without imposing rigid formatting constraints prematurely.

Communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilwoman Mango. Councilman Austin. Recommendation to direct public works to provide the City Council with various elements for a Safe Alleyways Improvement plan. So a staff report. We have no problem waiting to hear direction. That being me. That's okay. Well, hopefully they'll be a staff report that comes back very soon about this. So my intention with this, as many who live all over the city, this is a citywide plan, of course. Oftentimes you've heard of alleyways that have not been very safe in a multitude of different ways. So whether it's not having any pavement at all, having dirt alleys, having very bad shaped alleys, pavement is really bad. Lots of potholes or having areas where there is no lighting. And so in the First District, we actually were able to find a couple areas in the Wilmore City area that did not have any. They had Edison Poles, but no lights in them. So we were able to get lights there. And this is a plan that we've talked about. I know it's about six and a half years ago working in the Wilmore area, we walked the area is we were able to find ten quarts in ways that were in bad shape . And I remember we we were able to repave two of them, which is great. I know this is very costly. I know that the study when it comes back may be very costly. I also know that, you know, working with Edison, of course, getting a study back to find out which alleyways have in need, lights would be costly, but I still want the information. So we have some sort of plan to go off of. Should we have funding or should we have an opportunity for grants or what the opportunity may be? And so I really want to thank my council colleagues, Mongo and Austin, for jumping on board on this item. I think it's really important as we look at infrastructure holistically. I think our courts in ways that have often been forgotten and I know that we used to have funding for this back in 2006, I believe, of course, because of lack of funding. Now, we don't have that opportunity to look at our courts and ways or alleys as as we did before. We always pave sidewalks, streets. They're more highly utilized. But there are some areas that front some alleyways, that front homes. And so these are people's homes. This is they walk out into the alleyways, into the courts in ways and this is their what they see every single day. So I look forward to getting information back what we had proposed and what I had talked about with our public works director. We're very sad you're leaving. We're going to keep saying that. When I spoke with him, we had talked about a potential plan that could mean that it would be phased. So the first phase, looking at dirt alleys, so alleyways that do not have anything at all. Secondly, alleys that have very poor pavement, low PCI. And then thirdly, I proposed also looking at, as I mentioned, alleyways that need lighting. And so that's what I have here. I'll look forward to hearing back as to what we are. We can do what is possible for timeframe as well. I know this is a huge undertaking. It may take a year or so, but at least we have a plan in place. So again, thank you for your openness for for looking at this and of course, my council colleagues for jumping on board again. So Mr. City Manager, was there any comment from staff? We could certainly come back very quickly with a two from for a report to the city council to respond to that. How much things would what we can do immediately? I'll talk to the public works director on what he's been chatting with District one, what we can do immediately, but certainly things like a pavement management index, an analysis of poles that can accept lighting, those could be expensive and take some time. But we can also take a look at what we can do immediately and perhaps, you know, where our dirt alleys are and all that. So but we can definitely get a report back quickly and tell us how much this could cost and how long it could take. And also, I do want to point out that I believe next week it's December 15th. I believe we're coming back with an infrastructure report. And during that infrastructure report to the city council, we'll make sure we highlight alleys, causeways and lighting. Okay. And we have several council members that are queued up. Councilwoman Mongo. Yes. I am very pleased that we are going to look at this. I think it's really important that when we talk about our assets and liabilities that we take into consideration all components. Throughout history, there have been variances in whose responsibility certain things throughout the city are, be it our sidewalks and other types of community assets. And I think that knowing and understanding what options we have available will only be possible once we know those costs and have a full report. And I think that a study that brings that information to the council will then allow us to have the opportunity to potentially prioritize that over the next several years and or decades, depending on what that number comes back out. So I'm really looking forward to this and I think it's a great a great opportunity. There's definitely a variance. I know that when I lived in the seventh District, I lived on an alley that was a concrete alley, and all of the neighbors had back lighting and it worked out really great. But in the fifth District, some of the alleys that we have adjacent to Long Beach City College are. At one time asphalt, but on the near end of dirt at this point and have no lighting. And so and while we are doing everything we can in the meantime through coalitions of neighborhood associations that are working hard to help neighbors unite for motion detecting lights and the such, I think that a comprehensive review of what we have in what areas of the city and then for us as a community to be able to prioritize I think is great. So thank you very much and I hope that the Council will support this item. Thank you. Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez and Mongo for bringing this forth. I was happy to sign on to this agenda item, as are many of my colleagues experience. I mean, we we hear from residents who are eager to get their alleys fixed. And it's we're we're in a very difficult position when we tell our residents or we have to respond that, you know, our allies are a lower priority than streets and sidewalks. It's a it's a matter of resources and a lack of resources to address our infrastructure needs in this city. And I'm hopeful that we can get to that larger conversation at a later time. I know the legislators in Sacramento are looking at funding options to bring monies for streets and sidewalks or streets and for local streets. I think it's a it's important for us to have this information to at least know that when we do have the opportunity, we can we can move forward. We have a plan. And I think it's reassuring to many of our residents that that we're not forgetting about these important issues that are important to them. Allies in the safety of our allies are extremely important. And I'm glad that you brought this forward. We look forward to hearing back from the city manager. Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you. I, too, would like to thank my colleagues for bringing this item forward. I think it's a very good conversation for us to have. I do expect that the study will be expensive and the alternatives will be expensive, but I think that it's important to have that data as we move forward and we plan, and I'm fairly certain that the study is going to reveal that we have a lot of work to do in the area of ALS. But again, having that data I think will help us be able to plan for the future and think a little bit more strategically about how we're allocating our resources. So I'm all in favor of it. And the third district, we have a lot of neighborhoods that have primary access to the homes through alleys. And we've done, although not very frequently just today, we have participated in the past and are currently doing some cost sharing measures with our residents to try to fix some of the most vital alley issues that have flooding and other issues that are associated with the alley. So I think this is an important area for us to study. And I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. And I look forward to receiving the cost of a detailed study, but also some general data that can be provided to us through the infrastructure report that would give us some guidance in regards to what the potential costs associated with fixing some of our most critical alleys might be so that we can plan ahead. So thank you very much. I'm supportive of this item. Councilman Andrews Yes, thank you very much, Vice Mayor. I also want to thank Councilwoman Gonzalez for bringing this item forward to improve, you know, all areas. But this is a tremendous need in my district, especially, you know, along with paving. And and there are a few alleys that are so crime ridden that these alleys that have no purpose. So I would like to add an amendment to the plan to include some of the closure, some of these alleys, especially with those are ones with high crime situations. So ask of that, if you like. You know, Mrs. Gonzalez. If it's possible. I think this was more so just an inventory of the allies first. But I think that once we get that information back, I mean, I wouldn't I know closure of the alleys takes a little bit more. I think it has private property involvement. So there's a little bit more detail. But what I would suggest is that when it comes back, perhaps we could look at those specific alleys that you might be talking about and and see how we can fit it in the plan as to what we can do to close them if that is an option. I appreciate that very much. Thank you. Councilmember Durango. Thank you, base mayor. When it comes to alleys, I have one name that I need to throw out there. Kathy. Kathy lives in West Long Beach. Kathy has been is an 80 year old woman who has been struggling with her, Ali, for the last 40 years. It's a dirt alley. She gets a lot of infringement from people who just park out there and do their nefarious things. They have she has people who now are coming to create the homeless encampment in back in the back of her alley. And I know I spoke it with her, with Mr. Malloy and before about Kathy. He knows well about the situation, and the response has always been the same. We don't fund for Alice. So I want to thank Councilmember Gonzalez and Mongo for bringing this forward. This is a study that is long, long, long, long overdue. And I'm looking forward to the results of it, because as a consumer, Andrews has already stated these are magnets for crime. They're poorly lit. They're poorly policed, if at all. And we do need to look at ways that we can clean up that that part of our infrastructure to make it safer for our communities and for our neighbors. And I know that in the third district, it is true a lot of those alleys are used as entryways into house homes. So I think this would be a study that would be very welcome and I strongly support it as well. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Richardson. Thank you, Vice Mayor. And I want to thank my colleagues as well for bringing this forward. Alleys have always been sort of a sore point in each of our districts. And the answer to the common question of when my alley is going to be paved, the answer of we don't have an alley paving program isn't going to last much longer. I think I think it's smart to look at studying the issue first and understanding what that takes to evaluate it the right way. I think that's the right way to go and we'll figure out the resources later. We've taken things on before when we didn't have the resources, but we were able to really figure out a strategy to make it happen. Additionally, you know, we figured out how to get an alley paved here there. But you'd be surprised how many residents are willing to step up and figure out local strategies to get their their alleys paved. So I want to make sure that, you know, we after we do this study, we make we go ahead and complete that thought by having a conversation about innovative ways to fund infrastructure programs that we don't have resources for. So thank you again to my colleagues for bringing this forward, and I'll be in support. Thank you. And I have some comments as well. And I know we may have members of the public that might want to address council on this item. And I'd like to thank staff and I'd like to thank Councilwoman Gonzales especially for raising the issue. This is certainly something that affects all of us in our districts. I have to admit to you, I did not know we had dirt alleys in the United States until I ran for office in the second District. I have 14. I had 14 of them. And the reason for my shock is, as many of you know, I was born in India, where you are accustomed to seeing dirt alleys and chickens coming down the alleys. But that's the beauty of our democracy. We do hit the streets and walk our neighborhoods and we're able to see that. And so I think each of us is pretty intimately familiar with all of the alleys and corners and streets in our district. And so out of 14 over the years, with our one time funding, we've been able to, in the second district pave nine of them. And it doesn't seem like a lot. Why does it take that much time to do nine? And that's because it costs anywhere. And staff can correct me between 400 and $600,000. Well, actually, 400, $600,000. The cost to survey, I think the conditions. But paving alleys is very expensive. And so I have five remaining and I put that out there. Mr. Milloy, and I know you are aware of that, as well as all of the ones in each of our districts. And as it's been said here before, I think Councilmember Gonzalez and other councilmembers have mentioned the properties that are adjacent to dirt alleys or severely damaged alleys. It's an ongoing frustration to worry about for various reasons. You worry about your garage, flooding for improper drainage, the damage to your fence due to cars, the large potholes. And for some of our residents, their front door is right there. And so you are tracking in a lot of dirt. I don't know if those are the conditions that are in all of our districts where we may have dirt alleys. But when it's your front door, it's it's it's incredibly difficult to avoid tracking in what is in the alley into your home. So we've been fortunate enough to use one time funds to pave nine of the 14 dirt alleys a few years ago. We're looking at what we can pave this coming year, but there are five remaining. And I do think we need to be a city that is able to identify sources of funding for street repair, infrastructure repair. And as I have said, probably for the last several state of the second district, during the last several state of the district comments, it's a conversation that we really have to have with the larger community, the larger city, the residents. Here is how do we plan for infrastructure repair and restoration? Not so much new things, but repair and restoration of what we have. And that's that's a partnership and a conversation we need to have with the entire city residents, all our residents. And so I think that's something that we'll have to have an honest conversation about. I appreciate that. Our city manager indicates he will come back to us with what the cost of the survey may be and also what the sources of funding are. And and Mr. West, in doing so, I think we also need to give this Council an idea of what the entire city's cost is going to be. We're all representing individual districts, but truthfully, we're all concerned about how will we pay for the five in the second and however many may be in all of the others. It's our collective responsibility. We don't just limit ourselves to navigate our own districts. So I deeply care about how all of this would be taken care of across our city, not just in the second and not just in a few particular districts. And so I'm hopeful that this is the start of a larger, longer and very earnest conversation about what it will take to ensure that our infrastructure is able to sustain the activity that we have today, the residents that we have today, and perhaps the residents that we may grow to become as a city down the road. Thank you. And with that, I'd like to turn this over to the public. Any members of the public that would like to come forward and address council. Larry Kirk has the address. I want to make sure that we address the Peel Way and the southern half of payola away, i.e. that from the pay gate, the toll gate down to the end. It is that road is has long been on the list. It cannot be repaired. It must be according to the city and correctly so, rebuilt. Period. It is beyond repair. And I've always felt that a legal and moral justification could be used to using tidelands funds for that, since that road is heavily used by those that come to use the Marine Stadium by accident or by design. And right now it's cracked. I myself. That. Still myself, probably about five or six times on a bike. Tires getting caught in the in the cement cracks. But the residents. Houses get flooded when it rains so bad is the alley because they've got great big trees that are taking up or lifting up the concrete and the asphalt . And the city looked at it and it would be a sheer waste of money. The asphalt, it literally has to be rebuilt. Period. And that should be, I would hope, on the top of the list by virtue of the fact that he's used 365 days a year. By members of the public, bringing in their vehicles, the heavy trucks. They're the the towing vehicles. Sometimes by accident, sometimes times by design. So for us, I think it's it makes sense to do that. So make sure that's on that list. Thank you. Thank you. Any other public comment? Kate, seeing none members has been motion and a second for item 20. Please cast your vote. Motion carries. Thank you. And if we can go back to. Item 21. Communication from Councilwoman Gonzalez. Councilmember Ranga recommendation to join by signing the amicus brief prepared and filed by Cities United for Immigration Action.","Recommendation to direct Public Works to provide the City Council with various elements for a ""Safe Alleyways Improvement Plan"" with the following: · Cost estimate of a potential plan that could be implemented, similar to Pavement Management Plan; · Create a preliminary plan that would prioritize the worst alleyways in the city (for ex: Phase 1: dirt alleyways Phase 2: worst PCI alleyways, etc.); · Include identifying lighting opportunities for existing Edison poles; and · Time estimate as to when the study could be completed.","Here is a focused summary capturing the core objectives, proposed initiatives, and relevant context regarding the presentation on a Safe Alleyways Improvement plan:

The key objective is to direct the Public Works department to provide a comprehensive study and plan for improving the condition and safety of alleyways throughout the city. Many residential alleyways currently suffer from poor paving conditions like potholes, lack of lighting, or are completely unpaved dirt alleys. This negatively impacts residents whose homes front onto these deteriorated alleyways.

The proposed plan envisions a phased approach, first inventorying and addressing the worst dirt/unpaved alleys, then severely damaged paved alleys, and also identifying lighting needs in dark alleyway areas. Getting an upfront assessment of the scale, costs, and priorities is seen as crucial for eventually securing funding to execute this infrastructure renewal program over time. 

While undertaking a citywide alleyway improvement program will be a major cost, multiple council members stressed the importance of properly maintaining this overlooked infrastructure asset that directly affects residential neighborhoods. Developing a data-driven plan now will allow the city to opportunistically pursue grants or allocate budget for high-priority alley projects when funding avenues arise.

The impetus is to provide a sustainable solution after years of alleyway maintenance being deferred due to limited resources prioritizing major streets and sidewalks instead. By comprehensively evaluating current conditions first, the city can then strategically invest in bringing substandard residential alleyways up to acceptable safety and usability standards long-term.",0.8775000000000001,"Your role is to reason deeply about the substantive meaning and logical flow of information in each presentation first, without imposing rigid formatting constraints prematurely.

I know it's been a long meeting. So what have you hearing? Number 2/1, then hearing number one. Then we have public comment and the agenda. So hearing item number two. Actually public comment. I think I've only got one member of the public, but we'll do that one right after the two hearings. Hearing item number two, please. Madam Court report from Public Works and Police Department recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the hearing, adopt resolution and authorize the city manager to execute an agreement with Bixby Village Homeowners Association providing for enforcement of traffic regulations on private streets in Bixby Village with easements for public access for the following three streets North Greenway , South Greenway and Avenida de Castillo, District three. Thank you. I'm going to turn this over now to staff. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council, the staff report will be given by our Malloy and our. Director of. Public Works, Honorable Mayor and Council Members. Basically, the item before you is a hearing to allow a private homeowners association with private streets to come and have a contract with the city for us to enforce truck traffic enforcement on those private streets. The homeowners association had a meeting in in September of 2014, and they concluded that they wanted to get into this contract with the city of Long Beach. They contacted us in October of 2014. And we have conducted our studies. And we came to the conclusion that it's feasible to allow streets that are contiguous with other public streets, and they don't have gated gates that distinguish the private street from the public streets. To have this this provision. So the item before you has that the staff has has concluded and has three provisions in there that for this to go forward, the homeowner association has to agree that all traffic control devices shall comply with California vehicle code and will be reviewed and approved by our city traffic engineer. The cost of these new signs and striping changes will be borne by the Bixby Village Community Community Association. And the second item is any speed limit lower than 25 miles an hour on narrow streets that are not exceeding 25 feet shall require an engineering and traffic survey conducted every five years, and any cost associated with surveys shall be borne by the Bixby Village Community Association, and finally, that the city shall enforce traffic and parking regulations with approximately the same regularity as provided in public streets. So those are the three conditions that will be in the agreement, and that concludes my report. Thank you. With that, I'm going to go and do public comment and we'll take it behind the rail as part of the hearing. So please, public comment, please come forward. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and key members of the city council. My name is Daniel Zoon, and I am president of the Bixby Village Homeowners Association and like to start by saying that Susie Price, his office, has been absolutely wonderful to work with and so thank you. As has the city traffic engineer, they have really cooperated and helped us know what we needed to do. The issue really is that because we have private streets, we are required to maintain both the streets, the sidewalks, the curves, the other three of those streets. There was a condition place that they be, have public access. Bixby Village is off seventh Street, just below Cal State University at Long Beach. And and there's traffic around the school as well as the VA. We are experiencing problems with speeding and people running through stop signs. So we are hopeful that the Council will support this resolution and let us move forward to make our neighborhood safer for our residents. So, you know, this is not done in the dark ever since last August, when the issue came up before the board in all the newsletters and at every meeting, we have reported on the progress and what we need to do at the end of August. Today, yeah, October in August we had a special meeting at which about 70 residents attended, which is a bit we're a neighborhood of 374 homes. And there was there were some concerns raised. But the board, after taking into consideration the pros and the cons, voted unanimously to make this request. We've done everything we can to reach out to the public, let them know and and follow all the rules that we've signed up for. We've already replaced the stop signs and done most of the things that are required. So I urge you to vote yes on the resolution. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any other public comment as sir, please confirm. Actually. I don't get in an arm wrestling with Bob. I know he's going to win. Good evening. Thank you. Mayor and city council people for your time and energy and service to the community. And we all appreciate, regardless of what district we live in, we all appreciate your service and time. My name is David Balloon. I live at five 4102 Stoneham Court in Bixby Village have lived there for 24 years. I've been a former board member with the association and now I'm just a regular homeowner. I'm not going to go into a great amount of detail on this subject. You all have the paperwork and reports in front of you, but I do want to make several points in opposition of this. First and foremost, while presence of law enforcement who will be mitigating and siting for moving violations within the community may offer a temporary solution to a problem that is perceived not necessarily a realistic problem, but is perceived. I want to think that that's a temporary solution, not going to be a permanent solution. Two Driver Habits. Point number two Removing an officer from the normal tactical duties in their day to day operations will just to monitor traffic control in Bixby Village, I think is a poor use of resource for that police officer. There is clear consensus in the Bixby Village community from a independent survey that I conducted myself where there is opposition of this particular motion before you. And final note, several townhomes in our community have front doors that face the traffic areas that are being affected by this motion. Some of those homes have front doors within ten feet of the curb and the traffic where moving vehicles would be driving by. So with that, I hope these statements are taken into consideration. I can offer a copy of the results from the independent survey that was conducted to get that to the city clerk, if that's helpful. And I conclude my statement. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, sir. Singh any other any other public comment? Yes, sir. Please come forward. Thank you for the opportunity. I'm Harry Ivey, and I live at 480-101 Cactus Drive. I lived in Bixby Village now for. 27 years. We when we first built this community, I was a member and I participated in the Neighborhood Watch and security discussions over those numerous years. I think this is an excellent move to have the Long Beach police provide the same service they provide to the balance of Long Beach. I can't understand why our some of our neighbors don't understand what the octagonal red sign says stop means. But we've had problems with people running the stop signs. And we had a couple that got a ticket and they decided to fight it. And that's how this all came to be as a discussion item. I urge you to consider that we, like the rest of Long Beach, deserve traffic control, especially our stop signs. And I thank you for your time. Thank you very much, sir. Any other public comment? Yes, sir. Yes. I'm Bob Bennett and I live at Chelsea Court Village. And I walked the community probably six mornings a week. And most of the time it's right during rush hour. And I personally witness many cars driving through those stop signs when I say driving through there, not doing these California slow rolling stops, they're driving through the sides like they're not even there. And it's time for it to come to a stop. And we need Long Beach police in there, if that's what it takes to issue a few summons a few days a week until we get this under control. If that's what it takes, then I'm for it. Thank you. Thank you, sir. See no other public comment? I will take it behind the rail for deliberations that I'm in. Turn this over to Councilman Price. Thank you. I want to thank staff for working very closely with the Bixby Village Homeowner's Association to work through this item. This is an item that Jan Hall brought to our attention about August of last year. So we've been working on it for over a year in trying to figure out how best to meet the needs of the community. I understand that this is one of those issues where not everyone in the community is going to be 100% on board. That happens all of the time. But I also do appreciate and respect that the outreach that was conducted by your organization. I know having served in my position over three decades ago, Jan Hall knows the importance of community outreach and making sure that people have information. And I appreciate your homeowners association informing the residents of the proposed changes, and that was very important to us before we decided to move forward on this. Now, the area that we're talking about, I just want to make sure that my colleagues are clear. We're talking about patrol and enforcement on three streets and Bixby Village, three private streets that have public access easements. These streets are major thoroughfares through the Bixby Village community and some of our major corridors. And the one thing that I am concerned about for the residents, and I would ask that the homeowners association really do a good job of outreach on this is encouraging the residents in your community to actually use the sidewalks because a lot of times they'll walk right in the streets because it's such a small community. If, in fact, there is going to be patrols there and more visibility, then it's important that pedestrians and drivers follow the rules and make sure that they take precautions to be safe. Beyond that, I'd ask my colleagues to support this motion and support the will of this homeowner's association in the work that they've done. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. I have a couple of quick questions. I'm always supportive of a neighborhood association coming together to find a solution. Councilman Price. Is the vision of this that the normal amount of service provided in traffic enforcement to normal communities would be available in this area? Or would this be more like a contract services model? To answer that question in terms of what the the model is going to be. Mr. West. Will answer that. Honorable mayor and honorable councilmembers. I believe this is going to be a regular patrol. So if there is a complaint and it will be like anywhere else in the city if somebody is running through a stop sign. PD If you call the PD, they're going to respond the same way. It's not going to be anything special. That was the third condition that I read. They're not going to do anything special. And beyond that, they do throughout the city. We want to be very clear that it's not going to be 24 hours patrol for this neighborhood association. That was one of the conditions that the PD wanted us to have. So they're going to provide the same level of service that they will provide on any other street within the city. So if if you have in District nine, somebody is running a stop sign, we will provide the same level of service that we would do in District three or five or one so and all other one one through nine. So I think that that's part of the the resource challenge that I think one of our constituents mentioned. I know within the fifth District we have had emails lately where actual license plate numbers have been provided to PD because the number of people who choose not to follow the laws that we have in place is continuing to grow. And while community associations look for solutions like speed bumps and other things, I think that what we really need to also do is remind people to follow the laws that we have and apply that peer pressure our police forces. It's small but mighty, and traffic enforcement is a sliver of what they do and an important part of what they do. But just to ensure that we're not going to be straining any other resources and that we make sure that the city is equitably serviced. I'll be supporting this motion tonight. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez. Yes, I have a couple of questions myself as well. So I understand this will be part of our within PD. How did this come about? I heard, you know, it started with a citation among neighbors. But is there a certain criteria you have to hit to be able to make your private? Area, essentially. Able or accessible to public services. How does that work exactly? I think the anomaly is that this this private community doesn't have gates. So it's not distinguishing the outsiders and insiders that this is a privately held community. When a private development occurs, the streets are private. The homeowners association is responsible for maintaining everything the infrastructure, the curbs, gutters, everything that we do for public streets. They provide because they want to have the gates. When you provide the gates, it basically it's not a public street anymore. That's the definition of a public street. I cannot as general public access that street because it's gated. So when in this situation, I don't know how that occurred 20, 30, 40 years ago when this development was proposed that did not install gates. And it's it acts like a private it's a private street. That means the homeowner association is maintaining the street. They're maintaining the integrity of the infrastructure. But it's public because it's not gated and public have access to it. Now, there's a city anymore. That as part of the condition of improvement of the movement of this development. They were required to maintain those three streets as accessible to the public. So from the public standpoint, you wouldn't know the difference if you're driving down the street until you turn onto their street. So it is different from a private development in that one of the requirement of the city 27 or 30 years ago was that it remained public access. Okay. And I think that's all of my questions. I just wanted to ensure I was clear on that and how that came to be. All right. Well, thank you very much. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you. I just want to clarify a couple of the questions that were asked. These these three particular streets that we're talking about have public access easements. And and and when this issue came up, we actually had the homeowners association meet with the city attorney's office to figure out legally what options are available for traffic enforcement. Because, like I said, there major access points for corridors, major corridors in the city. So they are if they don't appear at all to be private roads, if you drive through them, they're very much public roads that are used for public access on a daily basis because they link to major corridors, streets together. So that's how it came about. And it went through the city attorney's office and trying to determine whether or not they were a public access easement. So. Thanks. Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Members, please go ahead and cast your votes on hearing item number two. Motion carries.","Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the hearing, adopt resolution; and authorize City Manager to execute an agreement with Bixby Village Homeowners’ Association providing for enforcement of traffic regulations on private streets in Bixby Village with easements for public access for the following three streets: North Greenway, South Greenway and Avenida de Castillo.  (District 3)","Here is a concise summary of the key points from the presentation:

- This is a hearing to allow the Bixby Village Homeowners Association to contract with the City of Long Beach for enforcement of traffic regulations on three private streets (North Greenway, South Greenway, and Avenida de Castillo) that have public access easements within the neighborhood.

- The three conditions of the agreement are:
1) All traffic control devices must comply with the California Vehicle Code and be approved by the city traffic engineer, with costs borne by the HOA.
2) Any speed limits below 25 mph require traffic surveys every 5 years, paid for by the HOA. 
3) The city will enforce traffic/parking regulations with the same regularity as on public streets.

- The HOA president stated the neighborhood experiences problems with speeding and stop sign violations, requiring police enforcement for safety. Outreach was conducted and the board voted unanimously to request this agreement. 

- One resident voiced concerns that increased enforcement won't solve the core problem of driver habits, wastes police resources, lacks full community consensus, and could impact homes close to streets.

- Other residents supported the agreement, citing firsthand experiences with chronic stop sign violations that warrant police presence to uphold traffic laws.

- Council members sought clarity that normal traffic patrol levels would apply, not specialized 24/7 monitoring using extra resources. The unique situation of ungated private streets allowing public access enabled this agreement option.",0.8285714285714286,"Allow your thoughts to freely explore the substantive ideas, logical progression, and contextual factors first without constraints. Once you have deeply grasped the complete meaning and intent, present a concise yet coherent summary that communicates key points clearly for stakeholder understanding.","Please summarize the following presentation, first internalizing the core objectives, proposed initiatives, reasoning, and relevant background through unrestricted contemplation. Then deliver a focused summary structured to convey essential information concisely for professional stakeholder communication.

Vice Mayor Andrew's recommendation to request the city attorney to draft an ordinance to authorize the city manager to issue local temporary cannabis. Special Event Permits. Good. We will do another report on that. Or you want. You take it. I need to speak. Need to speak first. Yes. Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay. Councilman Pierce, please. I plan on recusing myself from participating in this item due to the possibility of a conflict of interest. I have a financial interest in two business entities in the cannabis industry through prior consulting work with DHS, Verde LLC and Global Growth Investments and their principal partner, Danza Ronnie. While there has been no formal determination regarding the financial effects of this decision on these particular entities, I am recusing myself out of abundance of caution and would appreciate when staff notifies me that this item has been concluded. Thank you. Thank you very much, Councilman Orson. Thank you very much. So the Long Beach voters have repeatedly voted to approve the sale and use of cannabis in our city. Long Beach's ordinance allows for the cultivation, manufacturing, distribution and the sale of cannabis products. However, Long Beach Ordinance, Long Beach's ordinance does not address temporary cannabis events, and so they are not currently permitted. As of January 1st, 2018. The State of California began issuing state temporary cannabis event licenses, which authorize events with onsite adult use, cannabis sales and consumption pursuant to the state's medical and Adult Use, Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act. Some other cities in California have begun permitting cannabis related special events. For example, in Santa Rosa, the Emerald Cup has been successful, a been successful special event that features entertainment, education, competitions, sales and consumption. Last year, the Emerald Cup generated over $200,000 in tax revenue and about $17.3 million in total economic output for the community. The Convention Center has also received inquiries about holding trade shows for their cannabis or CBD products. Given Long Beach's success in hosting many notable special events. This seems to be an opportunity to include a local temporary cannabis special event at specific locations with controls in place for other special events. This could also be an opportunity for Long Beach businesses to benefit from these events, and the city can foster that local economic benefit. I understand that there are many factors that the city staff in the city attorney's office will have to look at and discuss to make this work as an ordinance. And I also understand the state law requires the city to identify specific locations in the ordinance where a temporary special event would be allowed. With that said, therefore, I would like to make a motion that is slightly revised from the agendas motion to request the city attorney to work with the city manager and appropriate departments, and in return to the City Council within 60 days with a draft ordinance that would allow the city manager to issue local temporary cannabis special event permits, provided that all appropriate criteria for special events are met. And at least 75% of the retailers at the event are Long Beach, based at the Queen Mary Events Park and allow the Convention Center to host cannabis CBD related trade shows business to business that involve the sale of such products without consumption. Ask my colleagues for their support. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Orson. I do also you will second this motion because in fact, I think we need to have some form, you know, like I say, where we can go and see what are we going to work this? Because it can be. But in process, I think we still need to go to our city council. I see the attorney to find out what we have to do and can do. So thank you again for my colleague for bringing this forward to anyone and anyone. And honestly, I can speak on this item. Please, come on. State. Your name, please. Very good, Hugh. Not only repeating the objections I had last time this came forward. I would just say it's really a strong indictment. Of this council. You say that you cannot. Meet the needs of this city. Without the revenue from this. And I remind you, I'm reminded of the. The reprimand delivered by Haile Selassie. Decades ago. Relative to inappropriate behavior. The dollar cost of this. We'll be more than this city will be able to measure. I urge you to reject this. And find another way. You get center city revenues. Other than this. Absurd. Rely on relying on drugs. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Goodman. The next speaker. Good evening. Mayor, vice mayor and city council members, and thank you for the opportunity to speak with you this evening. My name is. Jim Louis and I'm the head of special projects for Red Light Management, as well as the festival director for the Emerald Crop, the largest and most respected outdoor cannabis competition and consumer event in the world. I bring over three decades of experience to the Emerald Cup and I've been producing thousands of events, concerts, festivals around the world . Our company, Red Light Management, besides managing over 250 musical artists and more important to this conversation, has ownership in most of the major music festivals in North America, including Outside Lands with San Francisco, Lollapalooza in Chicago, Austin City Limits and South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennessee. The Emerald Cup takes place each December in Santa Rosa. The resulting in economic impact to the region is significant. Per the Beacon Economic Impact Report, the 2018 Cup generated 17 million to the county. The events is supported more than 200 jobs and 271 local vendors. And half of the nearly 30,000 attendees stayed in hotels and private homes in. In the area. The Emerald Cup is grateful to the City Council for the opportunity to develop an events ordinance and is enthused by the prospect of building it on the legacy we've created by launching an annual event in Long Beach beginning next year. I can tell you. That producing these events and implementing and planning perspective takes a minimum of six months to develop the compliance and infrastructure for an event of this nature. Thus, we urge you to continue expeditious policy development to allow us to announce a 2020 event by the end of the year. The Cup is the ideal partner for the city. We have a stellar record of compliance, secure operations and positive impacts to the community. Finally, we understand that while the burgeoning legal cannabis industry represents significant economic opportunity, many local jurisdictions are grappling with low or excuse me, with how to implement public policy that balances economic opportunity with the public health and safety. The economic excuse me, the Emerald Cup has achieved this balance and would welcome the opportunity to show you this firsthand. I invite you to join us at the Emerald Cup this weekend in Santa Rosa. We would be happy to give you a tour of the event, its infrastructure, security and operations, and provide a real time case study on economic impact and how licensed cannabis events can function. Excuse me appropriately and beneficially within the community. Thank you very much. Next speaker. Good evening, vice mayor and council members. I want to follow up with what Jim said about the Emerald Cup and the professionalism in pulling off a successful event in Santa Rosa. They've had no incidents at all since they started the event at the County of Sonoma Fairgrounds. To confirm that, I reached out to Long Beach PD along Beach Fire over the past several days and gave them their respective counterparts and their phone numbers up in Santa Rosa so that they could do their due diligence and determine the success of the event. Lessons learned and all that. In addition to that, Emerald Cup has also reached out the Santa Rosa Chamber and Santa Rosa Events Bureau to have them contact their counterparts in Long Beach, the CVB, the Hospitality Alliance in the Long Beach Chamber. Finally, we also provide to city and elected staff contacts with the State of California Bureau of Cannabis Control, the chief Laurie Ajax, and Governor Newsom's point person on cannabis, Nicole Elliott. We want to be as transparent as possible. We want you to do your due diligence as you go through this. We invite staff to call their counterparts in the state of California. Also in Santa Rosa, we've got nothing to hide. We encourage you to move us forward quickly. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And hello. Good evening, counsel. My name is Pam Charter Society. I'm an 18 year Long Beach resident in District four. I'm also the community education director at Long Beach and Long Beach Collective Association LBC. Allowing temporary permits for cannabis events will offer safe, regulated spaces for social consumption, which will promote public safety. It will also add another type of special events bringing a new. Experience to group growing tourism that Long Beach offers. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Excuse me. Hello. Good evening, Vice Mayor and Council. My name is Steven Contreras. I'm the community outreach director for the Long Beach Collective Association. I would just like to support this recommendation to move forward with the temporary cannabis event permit. This allows potential, great potential for economic opportunity, opportunity, tourism tax revenue and will illuminate the city of Long Beach to be a premier destination. Thank you. Thank you very much. I see there's no more public comment and one the. Would you please cast your vote? Councilman Mongo.","Recommendation to request City Attorney to draft an ordinance and return it to the City Council at its next meeting to authorize City Manager to issue local temporary cannabis special event permits, provided that all appropriate criteria for special events are met and that at least 75% of the retailers at the event are Long Beach-based.","Here is a concise summary of the key points regarding allowing temporary cannabis special event permits in Long Beach:

- The motion requests the City Attorney to draft an ordinance within 60 days that would allow the City Manager to issue local temporary cannabis special event permits, provided standard special event criteria are met.

- It specifies the Queen Mary Events Park and allowing the Convention Center to host cannabis/CBD trade shows (sale of products without consumption) as potential locations.

- This follows the state's legalization of temporary adult-use cannabis event licenses as of 2018.

- Other cities like Santa Rosa have successfully hosted cannabis events like the Emerald Cup, generating significant tax revenue and economic impact.

- The Emerald Cup organizers expressed interest in holding an annual event in Long Beach starting in 2020 if permits are approved, touting their compliance record.

- Some public comments voiced concerns about normalizing cannabis use, while others supported the economic opportunities and regulated social consumption spaces.

- One councilmember recused themselves due to potential conflicts of interest in the cannabis industry.

I believe that Council Bill 20 1053 be placed upon final consideration. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the re cry. The required public hearing for council bill 5 to 3 is open. May we please have the staff report and we have Edson here. Good evening, counsel. My name is Ed Banyas and I'm with Community Government. Before you today we have 945 North Irving Street. It's currently on Eastside and the requesting Eastside one, which is a single unit zone district and the requesting for a single unit zone district with an accessory dwelling units. So the the site is located in Council District three and fourth District in Villa Park neighborhood. And the site itself is just over 6000 square feet. It's a single unit residential structure and the request is to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. And you. The current zoning is ESU D, which is a single unit zone district to the north. You see ESU, D1 X, which is a single unit zoned district that allows for an accessory dwelling unit as well as E.R. 2.5, which is a row house up to 2.5 storeys in height and directly to the south. You already see an ESU, D1, which is a single unit zone district allowing for an accessory dwelling unit. The land use is single unit residential. It's predominantly single unit residential in the area with some two unit and motel unit scattered in open space to the north right next to the trunk station. And then the property itself is on the upper left corner. It's a the property is very pushed back. So the vegetation doesn't allow you to actually see the structure, but you can see the front of that property. And then you can see in the overall it's one story structures in proximity to this site. So went before the planning board in May and it was approved unanimously and it's before you today. And so far as a president, we've only received one letter of support and it is attached to the staff report. Whenever we have a rezoning, there are specific review criteria that we look at from the Denver zoning code. So there are five, and the first one is Kansas City with adopted plans. And we're focusing on three specific plans which are comprehensive plan 2040 blueprint in Denver, a language in transportation plan of 2019 and as well as the Villa Park Neighborhood Plan of 1991. So there are several strategies found in comprehensive plan 2040 that the proposed rezonings consistent with that are specified in the staff report. And I would jump into your blueprint in Denver. Groups in Denver classify this area as urban edge, which is predominately residential. When we look at the place type, it's classified as low, medium residential, which offers a mix of low and mid-scale multi-unit residential options. And for the street type classification for North Irving, Street is a local street which is primarily served by residential uses. When we dove into the neighborhood plan, the Villa Park plan of 1991, their specific strategy and language in this plan that talks about specifically strategy to to discourage development that is incompatible with this the scale and quality of the neighborhood as well as having a it does talk about having a housing vision expressed in the plan that is strong and vital residential neighborhood to increase the rate of home ownership, renovate and maintain housing as well as strategy each one a which is enhance the appearance in the quality of the neighborhood housing. As well as the rezoning meets the other review criteria specified in the staff report. Therefore, CPD recommends, based on all the findings of the review criteria have been met and staff is available for any questions you may have as well as it is here as well online. Thank you. All right. Thank you, edson. And this evening, we have one individual signed up to speak on this hearing, and it's Jesse Paris. Go ahead, please, Jesse. You can speak, Jesse. We're trying to get you into the queue, Jesse. I think you're going to have to unmute yourself. Jesse, we're going to have to have you unmute yourself, please. All right. It seems that we're having some problems. We can't, unfortunately. Jesse isn't. Amusing himself. And so we're going to, unfortunately, need to go ahead and move on. We've tried. Everything that we can. And so we're going to go ahead and continue on with the hearing. We want to allow any questions from members of council on a council bill 5 to 3. Counsel Pro Tem Torres. Thank you, Madam President. Hey, Edson. I'm going to follow up with a question, but I'm wondering if we have the applicant in queue, Mr. Salas, or is he in chambers now? I believe the applicant should be in the queue. And so it's Willie Salas. I have been tell. Of Mr. Salazar and the meeting. Hi, Mr.. Silas. Hi. I'm to asked the property. Owners. And we've talked about your current house that it sits way at the back of your property. What's your plan for building your edu? Right now, it's in very much the conceptual phase. I don't have any. Guidelines that I can really communicate or speak on right now. As you know, the pricing of construction materials is very high right now. So I don't have any immediate plans for what it would look like. But I can tell you that I look forward to taking advantage of this new rezoning and adding an 80 in the rear. And that's basically as much as I can say. In 80, you in the rear would mean demolishing the current primary house. Right. Which is at the rear of the property. Yeah. I think the plan is to demolish the almost 100 year old section of the primary house. Yes. Thank you so much. It's just a question for you really quickly whether or not this is a. Um. What Mr. Salis builds. He's allowed to build, attached or detached on the property, right? Correct. What changes or does anything change if it's an attached edu when it comes to bulk plane? Maximum height, that kind of thing. Cause I recall that the rear had a lower height than the primary. In a detached situation, what happens with an attached. So in an attached situation. And. There's setback requirements that he would have to rear set back requirements that he'd have to meet into any situation. He doesn't meet that. So he would have to work with development services to figure out exactly. But the code is very specific for this stone district that says in the rear the maximum allowed is 19 feet. If it's an attach and if it was detached, it would be 24 feet. And so in this scenario, he would have to follow those guidelines. On foot attached. Okay. That's all I had. No additional questions. Thank you, Madam President. All right. Thank you, counsel pro Tem Torres and Councilmember Sawyer. I thought I'd seen you up, but maybe your question got answered. It got answered? Yep. Thanks. All right. Great. Thank you. All right, so you. No other questions from members of council. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 5 to 3, Council Pro Tem Torres. Thank you, Madam President. I just really want to extend thanks to Mr. Salas for approaching our office early today, just to let us know what he was working on. He got ahead of our conversation by probably about a year because we're looking to reason this entire section through our multi neighborhood rezoning. So your neighbors will have the same permission. As you, Mr. Salas. If this does go through. But I just appreciate the communication from the applicant with myself, as well as the R.A. and their neighbors. I look forward to supporting tonight. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Counsel Pro Tem Torres, and I am happy to support this as well, seeing that it meets all of the rezoning criteria. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 523. Torres, I. Black eye, I. CdeBaca. Clark. Flynn. I. Hynes I. Cashman. I. Can each I. Ortega. I. I. Sawyer. I. Madam President. I.

Castro and Pacheco. So this legislation through the countryside there. This legislation would update our rental registration inspection ordinance to better conform with state law. As you all know, the REO program. Requires rental properties to be inspected at least every ten years, either by a city inspector or a qualified private inspector. For multifamily buildings, only a sampling of units are inspected unless a unit falls, inspection, fails inspection and CCI orders more to be inspected prior to 2017. A private inspector is only required to give the city the certificate of compliance that was issued after any failures were corrected in 2017. The Council changed Rio to require that private inspectors provide the city with a full report if any failures are found, so that CCI can determine if additional units need to be inspected. This legislation would add a third option to Rio for property owners who do not wish to provide their initial results to the city. It would allow property owners to hire private and private inspectors to inspect 100% of the units and only submit their certificate of compliance rather than the full report. This change will allow private inspectors to identify larger problems and will provide more flexibility without weakening inspections. Very good. Any questions or comments?

No items have been called out. Did I miss anything? All right. Madam Secretary, will you please put the first item on our screens? And, Councilmember Torres, will you please put councilor resolution to 79 on the floor. And the Council Resolution 2279 we. Adopted. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. Questions or comments by members of Council. Council Member Sandbach. Did you put on 386? Correct. This is 279. Okay. So this one is an issue. Thank you, Mr. President. This one is an issue for me. I'd like to call the vote on this because a National Western Authority is something that I had been involved in way before even getting elected. And there was a huge fight from community to have representation, voting representation on the National Western Authority. In the last few months, we've lost our voting member who is a resident of the neighborhood, and we sent multiple applicants to boards and commissions to fill that seat. While I don't have any objection to the individual who was appointed the voting member as a person. I think that we missed the intent of that seat to have resident representation because the individual does not live in our neighborhood. The other person being appointed is a non-voting member of our neighborhood, and I think that's incredibly problematic and not true to the intent of this seat. So I will be a no on this, and I encourage my colleagues to honor the neighborhood and the intent of this position as the only neighborhood or only resident representation on this board and vote no on this as well, and send boards and commissions back to the drawing board to ensure that we have resident representation as a voting member on this board. Thank you, Councilmember. Next up, councilmember talks. Just a question. I don't see groping in the room. I don't know if you. Have any information. About this particular bill. And if you could go over to the iPad is the presentation. Oh, sure. Skye Stewart from the mayor's office. I have not been totally involved in this, but are happy to try and answer questions for you. Here is the. It looks like the. Residence that was in terms of women concerned about providing them as well to keeping her place for them. As well. As the resident board. Member. I believe that is correct, yes. So we're looking at every almost scenario as a community member, board. Member, but the non-voting one in. So I'm talking off the top of my head here, so I probably will need to get you a more complete answer. But the way the framework agreement set up this or before that, there is a nonresident voting member and then a community member that does not necessarily have to be from the neighborhood but should represent a certain perspective and not just the seat that Curtis house is filling. And then the neighborhood seat is a non-voting seat. So there would be no voting member who a resident of the. Parliament for the various functions. I believe that is correct. But I would really have to check back with our remaining moments in a long time, because I look at that framework agreement. And. I think concerned about that too. I have no objection to this House actually, which. Is a phenomenal individual and a. Great board member. But I do concerned that it could getting compared to a. Community block. When there's no other. Residents from the neighborhood also on the board. So I'll be in the room as well. All right. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Hines. Thank you, Mr. President. And Mr. Reid, thank you for your. Willingness to field these questions, even though. This isn't totally your wheelhouse to see. You know it is. Is this the board or a third of the board members are District ten residents. I do not know the answer to that off the top of my head. So I am excited. I guess I believe that that's the case. So I'm excited that a district that has an outsized sense of representation for the board and I would share some concerns as well that someone from the neighborhood is it that this opportunity has become part of the has been saying nothing about us without us? And I would like to see that at least one member of District five of that specific community is is represented. So thank you, Mr. District Councilmember. Councilmember CdeBaca. Thank you. Mr. President, I have a proposal. If Sky is able to make the has the authority to accept it. Is it possible to flip these two appointees? Because one is the voting, one is the non-voting, one is a resident, one is a nonresident. Is it possible to appoint Mr. House as the non-voting member and the other person as the voting member? So again, the roller coaster ride of memory on the framework agreement, I believe. Well, so let me start first by saying that we would have to take that through a process that needs to happen for more efficient appointments. Romanian media involved. And we would need to talk with the mayor. But I believe the answer to that is no, because the non-voting member serves specifically has to be a neighborhood resident. I would again have to go back to the framework agreement and check that. But if I remember correctly, that is the case that there has to be a member of that neighborhood in that seat as a non-voting member or in this House would not be able to be put into that seat. Anything else? Is it possible for you to verify who is being replaced? Because although Jonathan Zobayan is on the board, he is not a resident of the neighborhood. He's a property owner in the neighborhood, but not a resident. And and I would be curious to know if he's cycling off or who is cycling off, because there are three other people that we know of who are cycling off. So I don't have that information in front of me. If you want to hold on voting on this one, I can see what I can do to get that if you want to come back to it. But I don't have it in front of me right this minute. Thank you. All right. Council member, can you. There are few more people in the queue sky. And my intelligence. Firm. Yes, go ahead, counselor. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate some of the questions being raised. I actually have a question about the third appointee. And this happens to have a success. I can't remember if I voted against this Pakistani person, but I know history concerns about the individual who informally got to the staff position immediately when they left. The employment being put on the board did not feel appropriate to me at that time having that continue. So it seems to me like it might be. This is a great example. We've made it a long time without committee, but I think we should send this committee for some discussion. I mean, it just seems like we can get more information on the current membership as a whole. It's very difficult always talking about an appointment without understanding the other members of the entire board. That's the practice that we now speaking on. When we're making council appointments, we never leave them in a vacuum. We uniformly serve. And so I think it's not about the individuals per se, but it is about what's the overall balance of representation, of importance of this body in particular. I'm afraid of the fact that given some of the economic impacts that are happening, you know, understanding how this may affect the national progress in terms of larger staff, it just seems like these are pretty important appointments at this moment. So I would make the motion to send this back to committee. And in generally speaking, I don't think we have to have a date associated with that because I don't know how that's going to be done this year. But if I can have a second, I will make that most of the sentence. That's all right. Madam Secretary, do you need anything else for that motion to be referred to through? And I'm seeing Councilmember Ortega as seconded. That you're a voice that Councilmember Ortega so that we have you on record on voiced you. So yes, I would like to second that. I think it's important for us to have complete information. And I've texted a couple of people just trying to clarify whether or not Mr. Zuckerman has left. And so I think it's important for us to have complete information on where we are with all those positions. Okay. And Councilmember Torres, I still have you in the queue. Are you okay with the referral to committee or if you want to jump in as well? Okay, then let me go over to you. Go ahead. Thank you. I am fully supportive of the Reform Committee. What I am remembering was I actually made the request. Of. The National Center to see. Someone from. The native community. And so I appreciate that this house was put forward. What I see as community representation. So I think there could be greater accommodation. For community representation and. Right. Councilmember, can each and every forward vote when you were. Like three or four. Yes. A specific request which is that if we can have this information provided by running for office and the information circulated well before committee, I think it's time to have a challenge getting responses from the information office. And I think it's really critical that we not wait until the committee date to begin answering some of the questions . And so we request that that information begin getting gathered in there, because it's possible that there could be some discussion and perhaps even, you know, the administration may decide to withdraw its proposal. So I don't think that our work needs to begin in subcommittee, but with that. Thank you, Councilmember. All right. Secretary, let's vote on the motion on the floor to refer. To the committee. Who am I. With? Hi. You're fine. I can eat. So I thought I said about coffee. I. Cashman. Councilmember Cashman We couldn't be more different. Ortega I know. I. Council President. Of Surgery Christos Boateng, announced results. 1339. Council Resolution 279 will be referred back to committee. All right, Madam Secretary, if you please, for the next item on our screen, it is called out by two different members. This is 386. So, Councilor Canete, you ought to go ahead with your comments.","A resolution approving the Mayor’s reappointment and appointments to the National Western Center Authority Board.

Please cast your votes. Just one person. Bush cares. We will do item 38 next, please. Item 30 Report from Economic Development Recommendation to adopt resolution declaring city owned property located at 854 East Seventh Street as exempt surplus land District one. Mayor John Casper has assured staff report on this item. Honorable Mayor and members of the city council. I'm going to introduce Mary Tours, who will walk us through what the Surplus Land Act requires for this property at 850 47th Street or the Armory. Mary. Thank you, Mayor. Members of the City Council. The Surplus Land Act is found in government code section 454220. The purpose is intended to prioritize re-use of surplus lands for affordable housing, parks and schools. It applies to all public land that is declared surplus. Notable amendments include expanding definition of local agencies to agencies not previously subject to the surplus land art. Clarifies this position to include leasing and not just sales, clarifies local agencies, does not include commercial or industrial uses, including non-governmental retail, entertainment or office development. No longer allows exceptions, but it does exempt expand exemptions available due to size, affordability and other characteristics. It requires city council action to declare a property a surplus or exempt for post prior to disposition requires written notice of availability to the State of California, Department of Housing and Community Development, as well as housing sponsors. Requires local agencies to submit their process to HCD for compliance verification. Allows exceed 30 days to respond to that submittal and gives the city a 60 day care period if its notice of a violation. It also imposes penalties if the property disposition is found in violation of authority and is not sure the product. The property before you is located at 850 47th Street. If the city gained ownership of this property through a deed reversion once the California Army National Guard ceased use of it as Long Beach Armory. The city did release a solicitation for a long term lease and selected Gundry partners to develop the property as 100% affordable housing development . Adaptive reuse of the armory building and improvements to combine park. Concurrent to our process, HCA and the state attorney general clarified that the facility does apply to leases. The city then paused negotiations with the developer until we could confirm the process that the SLA modified, as well as the exemption that was available to the project. Exemption available to the project in section five for 2 to 1 allows the property to be declared surplus if it meets certain requirements. One, not less than 80% of the building area will be used for housing. Number two, no less than 40% of the total number of units would be affordable to lower income households, and half of that 40% must be affordable to very low income. And three, a recorded regulatory agreement providing those minimum standards would run with the plan for 55 years. This project, the current building area, 72,710 square feet. The proposed residential area is 62,200 square feet or 85% of the total area. 63, unit 63 of the 64 units or 98% will be available to low income households, and at least 13 units or 20% will be available to very low income households. And number three, a regulatory agreement will be recorded. Next steps for this process. The resolution declaring it 5047 street as exempt surplus property occur. The City will submit the resolution and the regulatory agreement to CBA for compliance verification. 30 days will be allowed for each city to respond if they do not notice the city a violation and that 30 day lapses. The city could then restart negotiations with the developer. And should negotiations be successful, an agreement would be brought to the City Council for consideration. Therefore the recommendation of to adopt a resolution declaring a city on property as exempt surplus land as defined in the government code section and authorizes city manager designee to take any actions. And execute any documents necessary to ensure compliance with the Surplus Land Act and state regulations. This concludes my staff report. I'm available for any questions. Thank you very much for that. Extensive report. And thank you again to our amazing economic development department and to our city manager and city staff for all the hard work that you've continued to do on this project. I'm very, very excited about this. I'm very excited to see this process advance and even more excited to see the completion of more affordable housing in my district, which is something that is very, very needed as well. Is various improvements made to our gun binder park? This is something that will that will lead to reactivation of that area in a very positive way. And I'm happy to support this resolution, and that will help ensure the project that dances in compliance to the state's surplus land. So thank you very much. All right. Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item? There's no public comment. Okay, members, please, guys, remove. Gentlemen. Sorry. Cars.","Recommendation to adopt resolution declaring City-owned property located at 854 East 7th Street (APN 7274-019-900) (Subject Property) as ""exempt surplus land"" as defined in Government Code Section 54221(f)(1)(A); and, authorize City Manager, or designee, to take any actions and execute any documents necessary to ensure compliance with the Surplus Land Act and State regulations relating thereto.  (District 1)","Here is a summary of the key points from the presentation:

Core Objectives and Proposed Initiatives:
- Declare the city-owned property at 854 East 7th Street as exempt surplus land under the California Surplus Land Act
- Allow redevelopment of the former armory site at 854 E. 7th St into a 100% affordable housing project with adaptive reuse of the existing building and park improvements
- Comply with new state regulations under the Surplus Land Act regarding affordable housing requirements for surplus public land dispositions

Reasoning and Justification:
- The Surplus Land Act prioritizes reuse of surplus public lands for affordable housing, parks, and schools
- Recent amendments expanded its scope to include leases of surplus lands, not just sales
- The former armory property qualifies for an exemption if 80%+ of building area is housing, 40%+ units are affordable (half very-low income), and affordability requirements are recorded for 55 years
- This project meets those exemption criteria with 85% residential, 98% affordable units, including 20% very-low income units, and a recorded regulatory agreement planned

Relevant Background and Context:  
- City gained ownership via deed reversion when CA National Guard ceased using it as Long Beach Armory
- City had selected developer Gundry Partners for affordable housing reuse, but paused when Act was clarified to include leases
- Exemption allows advancing project while meeting affordability standards under the new state law
- Next steps are adopting resolution, notifying state, then restarting developer negotiations if no violation notice from state

The presentation outlines the city's proposed affordable housing redevelopment plans for the former armory site, the legal context of the updated Surplus Land Act regulations, and how the project qualifies for an exemption to proceed under the new rules while meeting affordability criteria.

Good evening, mayor. Council Members. Jennifer Short Chief Operating Officer for i'm going to point i'll try to talk fast. You already got kind of a preview of what we're here tonight to recommend, but it is very exciting. A second phase of taking title to additional land at Alameda Point to help fill out some of those pieces that Peter was showing you. We did. And so that's what we're here tonight to do is recommend that the council approved resolution author and has to move forward with that second conveyance of landed on me two point. Yes. I'm not going to go, you know, quickly, just there's a transfer history. There was one that was the no cost conveyance agreement was kind of resurrected in 2011. Phase one was about 510 acres of uplands. I think over 1000 acres of submerged property occurred in 2013. So here we are continuing that process of as the Navy cleans the property to the cleanup levels agreed to, they're transferring the property to the city. The conveyance package, which is to, you know, a lot of paper that's attached to your staff report, is, first of all, is the deed. So those are the deeds that are giving. You know, the we are signed by the Navy, signed by the city, transferring land from the city, from the Navy to the city. There's 11 parcels contemplated as part of this conveyance, 183 acres, 11 deeds. And the reason we we talked about this, I think, at the last council meeting, one of the reasons that we create so many parcels is to try to really isolate environmental conditions of the property that are very unique, so that when we then assemble development parcels, we can be really clear with legal descriptions and other things where if there are restrictions or there are issues that that everyone's really clear where those restrictions apply, where those issues reside, so that we try to minimize uncertainty from the development standpoint as any issues and things. So that's why we have so many parcels. In addition to deeds, we also have covenants restricting the use of property they'll essentially employ in the Marsh Cross Covenant, which actually already is city ordinance, actual contamination that occurred even prior to the Navy's use of the property that we need to be careful as we as there's digging and excavation of the property. And so those covenants put into place those restrictions. And then there's one site which I'll show a map of quickly, a petroleum covenant restricting the use of the property in the Northwest Territories. You can't have residential we can't do residential there any way because it's Tidelands Trust. It's an open space area. So it's not a real implication for our development plans. And then bills of sale for the storm drain systems, the sewer systems and any personal property within phase two. And then really a clean up amendment to our lease in furtherance of conveyance of the Navy. As we transfer property, we need to take buildings out of our lease since we now own them. And so we're just cleaning up that master lease to account for that clarification question. So when I was reading through this and there were several references to personal property, give us an example of what personal property is. Well, there's for instance, I mean, what I'm what I it's, you know, equipment and other things that may get left in the building. So, you know, for instance, a building 29 has those cranes and things like that. I mean, there might be equipment and other things that are just essentially were left there, but even furniture, to be honest. Got it. Things so conveyance phases, we're we're anticipating four phases here. We've already got the blue is Peter and he's talking about the light pink is what's we're contemplating the 183 acres, the salmon color, probably more like next year. And then the red probably closer to 2021, 2022. And which are those? You know, there are parts of the red that may move up to phase threes, like some of the storm drain lines here that you see. But those two these sites here really because of the contamination issues, it's still there. Complicated need to get worked out. Those will be later phases of conveyance. But the last phases of commands, the phase two conveyance, you see these parcels, the 11 parcels, the lagoon, some where the piers, where the market ships are a good portion of site, which is why, you know, we we it's important for us to move forward tonight because we are this is part of our obligations under our disposition development agreement with site developers is to have the land so that we can then convey it to them. And so moving that forward as quickly as possible, 37 acres of uplands, 146 acres of submerged property, obviously the majority of it being a seaplane lagoon in 11 parcels. There are areas with land use restrictions. Two acres of the 103 acres have land use restrictions. Those. And they all have said these are in the enterprise districts. This is on, as Peter already mentioned, under the urban park. All of the plans have been that are here with these institutions are consistent with the city's plans. Next steps. We are shooting for March, so next month we think that's very doable. We're on track for achieving that. I think the phase two public trust exchange, which is then taking the land that we now own as part of phase two and exchanging trust lands in and out of the trust according to an agreement and legislation done a long time ago will be doing in April and then completion of the city planning process to move forward, especially with that portion north of Atlantic that I just mentioned and city being able to start construction later this year , 2017. So this phase two conveyance, we're really excited not only because it's really the next stage and it's a lot of land and it's a great thing, but also because it will be is a key step in moving that side project forward. So I'm trying to talk as fast as I can here, but happy to answer any questions you may have at this point. But we're you know, I know it's late at night, but it is always a from our staff standpoint, a really exciting thing to keep moving this forward and be ultimately the owners of this land. And so I'll just leave it at that. Thank you. Member de Saag. Thank you. I had the pleasure of speaking with MZ Art and Missouri very brown earlier this week to raise some questions. And before getting to that, this is a similar thing that we did with Phase one, but it's important to make sure to ask questions. So one of the questions of the two questions, one of the questions I asked is, is the Navy responsible to remediate Navy caused contamination discovered following conveyance? And the answer to that was yes. Upon conveyance of the property, all liability related to unforeseen environmental conditions pursuant to the Superfund law would remain with the Navy in perpetuity. And then there's more, and there's additional answers to that. The second question I asked is What happens if there is disagreement as to the causation with regard to later discovered contamination? And the answer to that was that turns on the facts of each discovery following conveyance if the city or the city's developer discovers buried or hidden pollutants or contaminants. The burden is on the new owner to prove that the pollutant or contaminant was on the property at the time of conveyance. Often this is easy. In other case, it might be more difficult and it might be difficult where the city or the city's tenant under a lease in furtherance of conveyance is utilizing pollutants or contaminants on the premises such as solvents. So the developer or their or their tenants might be using contaminants. So they might be the reason for the fault. So it the response ends with the Navy will most likely assert that the tenet was the cause of the solvent release rather than the Navy. So these cases will often be litigated with the ultimate liability, turning on the facts and proof. However, and this is the key point from our staff. However, in order to further insulate the city from liability, the city has been proactive in procuring. Some kind of insurance that would protect the city in the second scenario. And something like that was already trigger many, many years ago. Similar to that, I guess, in the case of what was then known as East Housing. So thank you. The other comment. I swear. And just to follow on Councilmember de Silva, I understand also that when property is is conveyed to a developer, that developer will be required to procure remediation insurance as well. That's that's correct. So there's like three layers of protection for the city. Right. That's absolutely correct. For instance, in the disposition development agreement site, they were required to acquire what's called pollution liability limited liability insurance, PLL insurance. You know, and so in order so they have that insurance, they're required to get it. It's not cheap either. And so they are required to do that. And then we, too, have our own insurance that the city has purchased to protect us from those those issues. Thank you. Member. I just wanted to extend a big thank you to our staff. Mr. Russell, it's always so informative listening to you, but for Janet and Karima Brown, you know these materials, I think, in your sleep. But it's it's been a big job. The fact that this is a smaller amount of acreage than the previous conveyance is misleading because there's probably more significant doings as far as cleanup going on in these fewer acres. But, you know, we are in the process of doing something this community set out to do a couple of decades ago, converting this over to civilian use . So thank you for leading us through this process. And we look forward to to that ceremony in March and working with you more in the future. Thanks for your good work. Any other comments from council. So I also want to commend staff and I want to share with the community that this is very exciting for us. I think it's you know, it's a big step. And when we get this property from the Navy, it'll be wonderful. And I, I fully support having some kind of kick off for the community when we get this property. So that being said. Okay, may I mention okay, I it's my pleasure to move that we approve a resolution authorizing the city manager to accept on behalf of the city certain surplus federal property and to accept, execute and record conveyance documents in substantial conformance with certain phase two property and conveyance documents from the United States of America, acting by and through the Department of the Navy to implement the Economic Development Conveyance Agreement for the former Naval Air Station Alameda Phase two Alameda Point Conveyance.

If you plan to speak on this item, please turn in your slip. Because that. Um. For. If you if you need a break, that's fine. Okay. We're going to take a short break right now. I'm going to.

Thank you, Mr. Monica. Do do we have a do we need a search staff report or how do we feel about this? We don't need one. We have everything in the agenda in front of you. Okay, then. I don't think that I've. There's not a request for one. We'll just move forward. I have a motion by Vice Mayor Richardson in a second by Councilmember Ops Investment. Richardson. Just quickly, I want to thank public works or, you know, doing your diligence to make sure that that you understand and we understand public works and planning and requirements under secure. What this does is the repurposing of this pipeline actually will allow for expansion and resources that ultimately decrease our carbon footprint, address air pollution across Southern California. So the purpose of it is good. It gets rid of a crude oil operation and makes it into hydrogen fuel. And, you know, that's a use actually an actual use or zero emission of the technology. So those are good. But but since it's under our homes in council districts, eight, nine, we need to make sure that diligence is done and that's what staff have done. So that said, I'm happy to make the motion. Kathryn Austin. Oh, yes, except I also support this motion. There's been a lot of due diligence into this. The secret process was actually followed and there this is, I think, a better use of infrastructure. The existing infrastructure will result in cleaner energy use in our city and beyond. I did a. I have a question related to just this public outreach when the project actually is occurring again. Can staff talk about that in any way? How will the public be notified and about when when this process is actually going to occur? Yes. Patricia Devendorf, her from Development Services will answer that question. Good evening, council members. Patricia Defender As outlined in the Council letter, the applicant will be sending notification to 8000 different properties along the pipeline to give them notification of the pipeline and to provide information about pipeline safety. The applicant is on the line if there are questions that are should be directed to them. Okay. Well, the reason I ask the question is obviously there are some risk with any infrastructure that they go through residential communities in any way. I just want to make sure that there is a robust information so that individuals know how to notify and protect themselves should something go awry. I understand that there are a lot of provisions put in place to minimize any sort of risk associated with the project. But nothing is 100%. Nothing is foolproof. And so I just want to make sure that we're notifying residents on who to report issues to should they find issues come up and the applicant can speak to that . It would be great. Hello. This is Jeffrey of Paramount Pipeline. I just to address your question, Mr. Aston. We're doing a commissioning plan for this. Pipeline, which is going to take two or three days. And we're we're not going full stream. We will be taking up to 25 PCI, holding it and doing a leak survey across the whole entire line, making sure there's no leaks. And we'll take it up to 50, 100. 120 and 140 which which will be around the operating pressure. We are also sending out the mail outs, like Patricia said, and those are annual as well. So they the residents have been receiving this while it was in crude service and they will be receiving these when we are shifting to hydrogen as well. So and we also have the 24 seven call number for the pipeline as well. So it's going to take two or three days to commission the line into hydrogen and make sure there's no leaks. And then the mail outs will be coming out as well. Okay. Thank you. And I would just ask that my office be included in those notifications as well. Thank you. We have a motion in a second. Is there any public comment? I think we have some. There's no public comment. You're right. We have. I don't see anyone here either. Let's go ahead and do a roll call vote, please. District one. I district to. My. District three. I district for. I. District five. I. District six. I. District seven. I. District eight. Right. District nine. My motion carries. Thank you.

Just as a reminder for the public, that's the way these things are typically agenda, but we want to do it as close to that time as possible. So I have two more requests.

Thank you, Councilmember Rasmussen. This council bill, if approved by the council, formally completes the vacation of a portion of Terry Avenue and a nearby alley. The petition for the vacation was in 1988 by King County. The county requested their vacation to construct the North Metro Tunnel terminal along Ninth Avenue and Pine Street. The public benefit that the council required at that time was for King County to construct and maintain a North-South pedestrian corridor on the site connecting Olive Way and Pine Street. King County paid the vacation fee, but a public benefit requirement relating to the pedestrian quarter was never provided because it was eventually determined that the pedestrian access through that site was infeasible. For that reason, the vacation was never completed, but it's been left open. Now the county plans to sell the entire site, including the rights of way for the expansion of the Washington State Convention Center. In order to complete the vacation. However, an alternative public benefit has to be provided by the county in addition to the fee that they've already paid. The county proposed and the Department of Transportation has recommended that King County pay the city $150,000 to be used to develop street concept plans in the area surrounding the Washington State Convention Center expansion. It is unusual. We don't know of any vacation that's been left open this long. However, the public benefit portion has been left unfulfilled. But looking forward, it may be in the best interests of the city to to grant this now with the new public benefits, because the pedestrian access and wayfinding and benefits between Capitol Hill and downtown and surrounding the convention center can be more appropriately designed with these funds to meet current public and and transit needs.

The bill authorizes a number of easements relating to the first Hill streetcar, and these are necessary for the installation and maintenance of 11 eyeballed attachments to buildings and other structures along the speaker line. Those attachments will hold the cables necessary to power the streetcar line, and the easements will minimize the installation of additional steel poles along the existing route.

Intelligent Emergency Operations Management Software. And did you have specific questions? I did. My my question had to do with we've been seeing a lot of different contracts come through. And some of the other ones that were in the the consent calendar also included information regarding different bids through an RFP. So I just my question had to do with whether or not we conducted an RFP for this software. And then my other question is, my understanding is that it is for emergency operation community communications. But seeing as this question came up with other vendors, I just wanted to know if there if this vendor provides any of the records, any of the data or provides any of the data with DHS or ICE. So staff who's going to be have access to it? Questions we have. The captain, however, and captains on back. Mayor? Yeah. No, man. Chief. Oh, sorry. I'm Chief. Deputy Fire Chief with back. But that's neither here nor there, so I didn't quite. Have a. Question from back there, so. And we'd like you to repeat it. And I think Captain Oliver is actually going to have to answer it, but. Okay. We'll see what we can do for you. So two questions. One is, if we conducted an RFP when we were figuring out which vendor to go with for our EOC. And then the second question is whether or not this vendor has some sort of BSI or data broker agreement with Department of Homeland Security or ICE. There's any retention of data and if they share. So on the first question, we didn't actually conduct an RFP, but we had vendors, about five vendors, and I could get you a list. I don't have all the names because we've had it for a couple of years. So we we looked at them, we tested them, we had them come in and present to a group of people, including at the time Bob Pond, who was the acting assistant city manager. And he actually oversaw the build of the EOC as well. So we looked at a variety. Of softwares and and came to the conclusion that for the value of what we got, it was the best choice. So we researched other departments that had some of these softwares and then came to the conclusion. To purchase it. It's a subscription. Mm hmm. So it's. You know, like most subscriptions you renew annually. It doesn't have any connection to ICE. It's an internal use software. So it doesn't go out to the public. It's not available to the public. I don't have. I don't have the city attorney. Here, but it does keep. A transcript, which is good for us when we're asking for reimbursement on disasters. So whenever you have a transcript of something, there's probably. You know, ways to. You know, public information records. But it's controlled by us. Right. The data and the transcript doesn't get sent externally. That's. Oh, no. No, no. It's completely internal. And I wanted to clarify, when you said it's not in regards to the public, people that are part of cert are part of this is what we used to, right? Yeah, we have rolled into that. As much as it's not open to the public, it is open to those of us that are part of cert, which I am, and I do always encourage other people to join. Yes. Member Ashcraft. Thank you. Deputy Chief is our Vic and Captain Oliver. And. Okay. So my quit and you know, speaking of cert, I believe I read that there is a cert training starting in April is that. April 12th. Starts the next. Course series. Okay. And then we'll have two more towards the fall. We kind of take a summer break and do some individual classes. Okay. Yeah. And we can go online and and. Register. And find out about it. And it's free and it's free. So my question on this, this sounds like pretty awesome software. And I do understand that it's a renewal of a subscription that you've had and the software is manages communications in a disaster and linking parties in various parts of the city and to get information in real time out there, which is great and up on screens in the EOC. My my question because this is 32,000 a year, up to ten for a ten year contract and then it can be renewed. And so I see that we've got the funding in the Facilities and Maintenance Fund, Emergency Opera EOC fund for two fiscal years, the one we're in now 20 1718 and next fiscal year 1819 and but future years funding remains at council discretion through the biennial budget process. My question is this. I mean, has the EOC established a budget for what you need? Because just at our last council meeting, when we were looking at the mid-year budget and sort of an overview, there was an item I think it was for remind me what it was, but. It was for the operating costs of the building, like gas and electric and some things like that. But we're working on bringing you a budget because there's really a whole world of, you know, managing disasters. And all the things that come along with that. So we really do have some expenses. And for clarity. You know, we thought it would be nice to have something you could really well. And what I'd like to know is. I'd just like to add that it's, it's part of our mid-cycle we. Can anticipate. Yeah, absolutely. So that is actually in the mid-cycle as part of our. Okay. That I will hold my questions until then. But, but, and so just for clarity, we would get an overview of what a year's budget for the EOC look like. And we're bringing this to you now because of your $75,000 cap. And so, you know, we don't spend. That each year, but over the course of the term of going on with a subscription. Fee, it will go over the budget. Yes. So understood. And I appreciate that. Okay. Thank you for answering my questions. And with that, I'm prepared to move that. We the recommendation to authorize city manager to execute a ten year contract with 2 to 5 year options to renew in an amount not to exceed $32,000 annually for a total not to exceed $640,000 over 20 years with great software, Great Wall Software, LLC for the use of its virtual emergency operation center intelligence emergency operation management software. That was a mouthful. So our second it that I had had a question, I wanted to clarify as much as I think you were trying to say this as much as it is a ten year contract are being asked to approve you can also terminate you said with 60 days notice we're not we can always get out of the ten years. Yes, very simple to get out of. It's like a. Subscription. And in fact, it's a little padded in case they you know, we have some, you know, add some more licensing or do any additions or do any extra work. So it's actually not that much per year. I think we were at 28,000, including all our CERT members. So it is lower than that. We just wanted to. Build a little buffer for any. Changes that may come down the pike. And so you can't it's. A subscription, so you can get out of that subscription easily. At any time. So thank you for clarifying that member matter. I think that's a very important point for the public to know because 20 years in the software contract is. Now. It seems like a very long time, but you can get out at any time. And it was just too. Just wondering why if we get out there and we just buy a subscription the next five years. We we could, but then we'll have to repeatedly come back and ask if we're really enjoying it. We'll move on. And if we're not, we'll get out. And right now it's been really. Really good and usable software. For us, really proving itself. All right. So there's motion on second. All those in favor I motion carries unanimously. Thank you very much. Thank you. So that completes our consent calendar. Now we are on 6 a.m..

Thank you for using that function. You are recognized. You so much. I'm going to focus my remarks on the efforts that I have been working with all of you to lead and with members of the public. We have, for the last year and a half, been working to broaden our city's definition of public safety to with intention, include both traditional public safety investments while increasing funding for critical upstream investments and crew added safety for all. This budget makes strategic investments in public safety so that law enforcement can respond to calls that only they are qualified to handle. That includes fully funding the Seattle Police Department plan to hire 125 additional police officers, more community service officers, and technology resources necessary to support alternatives to police response and consent decree compliance. It includes funding and fees to address staffing and operational needs of our dispatch workers at 911 at the Community Safety and Communication Center. And includes funding for the Seattle Fire Department to add 20 additional firefighter recruits in 2022. In addition to the recruits that the mayor's proposed budget funded as it relates specifically to community and safety community safety investments. We have two old safety in neighborhoods from the ground up laying the groundwork for non law enforcement response to crisis including nearly 4 million are needed to allow for their modest expansion next year. 4 million to stay in the community safety hubs in West Seattle, southeast Seattle and a central district operated by the Community Safety Seattle Community Safety Initiative. A funding to support a workgroup with experience of domestic violence. Recommend alternatives to incarceration that address misdemeanor domestic violence. And funding to support expansion of the be filing version program of the City Attorney's Office so that we limit diversion opportunities to only those under under 25 years of age. We've made several health investments into all data points through the pandemic. All data points to the pandemic having a significant impact on our behavioral health and adequately erupting into self harm is salt and fire and other forms of violence. This budget includes significant new investments in mental health and substance use disorder, including $1,000,000 to expand behavioral health services in Seattle, public schools and community clinics for new mothers, seniors and the uninsured. 1.5 million for mobile services for survivors of liquor based violence that help survivors stay safely housed. I don't know. Are you following the budget? Remember Peterson? Sure, you can buy 5 million to match the county's investment in a new facility for people experiencing homelessness who need behavioral health supports. And so that's missing human services. As the pandemic is through its second year, we know that we must maintain a baseline of increased support for households who continue to struggle the workers we rely on to help. That includes 600,000 for a wage equity study to address high turnover and compensate frontline workers. Being the work that we desperately need to do. An additional eight FTE for the Human Services Department hire folks with accounting and financial skill. A recommendation of an outside accounting firm is been working with HST on a plan strengthen their financial controls. 1 million for services for work force, affordable housing providers, cities first investment and African senior wide wraparound services at existing meal programs. $1,000 for a small investment will will help a 65 residents keep home when they lose state benefits $5.1 million to sustain current levels of food support through most of 2020. To help families struggling with the ongoing pandemic stay healthy and nourish. Closing. I just want to offer some remarks. I've asked about the payroll tax. It's so important to note that this budget ends on the jumpstart it will tax, which the attorney homes has so far access fully defended against a legal challenge from Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce after the city attorney submits briefs due on December 15th. Next city attorney will take on responsibility for this case, and oral arguments will proceed under the direction of the incoming city attorney next year. The defense is unsuccessful. The incoming mayor will be faced with causing cuts that could $200 million or more in 2022 in May can create a deficit for the 2021 budget, which is an inner fund loan payback with payroll tax revenue. This would make it nearly impossible to avoid across the board cut. I think it's really important to place the action that this council is about to take within the context of this case moving forward. Want to us with again thanking the budget chair for all of her work, pulling us together, moving in the direction that is the best for our city in this in this time. I want to thank the rest of my colleagues on the Council. I appreciate the collegiality and sense of common purpose and common good, as well as all of the hard work that behind the scenes council central staff has done day in, day out for the last six weeks, as well as each of our officers, personal staff, and want to most of all thank the community advocates who without them , we, I believe, would not be able to do as good of a job ensuring that this budget document is an expression of our values of this city. So thank you, everybody. Thank you so much, Councilmember Herbold. Appreciate it. Okay. Next up is let me make sure I'm going in the right order. Next, we. Will hear from. Excuse me, Councilwoman Morales, then Councilmember Sawant, and then Councilmember Lewis. And you are more concerned about us. Thank you. Apologies. Thank you. President Gonzalez, I want to begin by acknowledging the hundreds of community advocates, workers, neighbors and community organizations who really engaged with us in this process. I think their voice has been very important, as Councilmember Herbold stated. This was a hard budget year, in my opinion, made harder by a reluctance to reject some very troubling budgeting practices by our police department. And I think it demonstrates that as a council, we can find the resources in our general fund for important city priorities. That's always been my point of view in the conversation about reducing the police budget. As I said last week, you know, with the $90 million, we could fund 57 units of permanent supportive housing, 100 home zones, 190 new street outreach workers for given back rent for 3400 or so families and provided nearly five transitional housing sites like the one I had proposed for organizations like the Cheapskate. Club. And still funded six additional public toilets. So I do think it's important that we acknowledge why we haven't been able to fund more of the various services that would address the homelessness crisis and help move people off the streets and into more stable housing. That said, I am very excited with the budget that this council has is about to pass. I think it's really important that we are investing a million and a half dollars in public arts and creative industry programing, $375,000 for black girls and young women and for black, queer and transgender youth. We're investing a total of $750,000 in restorative justice programing so that our young people, our educators and our communities can really gain a greater understanding of what it means to move away from punitive discipline and toward healing. And I want to thank my colleagues for supporting my amendment to create Juneteenth as a city holiday. Federal, state and county employees already enjoy this holiday. So I'm excited that our city workers will also be able to mark this important day. And I'm very proud to be starting down the path to regular baseline inclusion of public toilet infrastructure development in the city. That's going to be a critical need and I'm excited that we're starting in that direction. I also want to thank the neighbors from District two for their advocacy. Thanks to that advocacy, we'll see restored funding for culturally responsive afterschool programs, $800,000 for community engagement, support for the neighborhood planning process that is beginning in the Chinatown International District , as well as additional street cleaning and trash pickup support in the city. We'll see $2 million more invested in sidewalk, sidewalk infrastructure. That's in addition to the 2 million for a District two sidewalk infrastructure from last year. And we are getting funding to complete the bike and pedestrian trail at green space. We're also funding a cookie just park the Lake Washington Boulevard expansion prescription food pilot program for the Seattle Indian Health Board, as well as expanded mental and behavioral health services for the Jewish people and to advance some environmental sustainability projects for the Danish longhouse. As a council, our role is to deliver the resources needed to keep our city healthy and safe and to protect the most vulnerable in our community. And I want to say that as a city that many across the country look to for innovative solutions to our municipal challenges. My hope is that next year we can kind of lift our heads above the fog of COVID and really start thinking creatively about the kinds of forward thinking policies that we can implement to stop displacement, to house our neighbors, and to create bustling, walkable neighborhoods that our community is really eager to, to see and to expand. I truly believe that if we have the courage to take kind of a side step toward innovation, we can plan for sustainability, for urban development and for economic justice at the same time. I'm hopeful that we can work collaboratively with our new mayor to move these resources into community and deliver on the investments that can change the material conditions of our neighborhoods and really help our neighbors thrive. So I want to thank central staff the. City clerks, our I.T. department and our comms team. I especially want to thank Ali Michie and Yolanda Ho, who have been extraordinarily helpful, collaborative and have offered innovative assistance through our budget process to our office as we think through how to move forward. I do also want to thank our facilities team. I've been coming in a couple of times a week for the last several months now, and I've seen how much work goes into keeping City Hall safe, especially in COVID. So I want to thank Yahya and Chris for checking in on me once in a while here. It's kind of quiet at City Hall, but really appreciate the work that our facilities team is doing to keep City Hall safe. And finally, I do want to thank my staff, Alexis Tala, Darcel Touch, Devon Silverdale and Imani Carey for bringing your passion, your smarts, and your deep organizing skills to the work that we do for the people of District two. I'm very proud to have all of you on board and look forward to moving this budget forward and moving forward next year with some innovative policies. Thank you. Thank you so much, consumer wireless counselor. Please. Thank you. I will be voting no on the budget. This vote is a vote on the budget as a whole. Just to explain to members of the public, not on the amendments to the budget, if we were to only look at the amendment to the budget. There have been many progressive changes won by community organizers, particularly from the activists in the People's Budget and Solidarity Budget. And I voted yes on those amendments. Over the past year, the renters rights movement has organized to fight back in skyrocketing rents and other abuses. And through that, organizing alongside our council office has won many important victories. We won the right to council extensions of the eviction moratorium during the pandemic. Six months notice for rent increases. We just went into effect on November eight, just got protections for evictions, the ban on school year evictions of children and all public school workers, and economic relocation assistance worth three months of rent for renters economically displaced by rising rents. That is when they are forced to move because their landlords have raised their rent by 10% or more. It's a law that is the legislation that will take into effect in July of next year in this budget that many of the renters who fought to win those victories also organized with the people's budget to win the funding necessary to enforce these new rental rights to fully fund the right to council. If you're a renter and you're facing eviction while avoiding cuts to the funding for the rent, organizing and education done by the tenants union and other community organizers in the Central Area. One Funding for the Clean Greens Fresh Produce Program, funding for the Garfield Super BLOCK, and the technical changes to the Office of Housing. Funding to make it possible for them to fund the new Hope Family Housing Project. This project, and the purchase of Square Park Plaza by Lehigh and the New Hope Community Development Institute are serious progress that have been won by the people's budget advocates this year and are real priorities for preventing and reversing the displacement of black, working class and low income families from the central area. My office urges the Office of Housing to support these crucial projects without delays. We have won the funding in the budget. Now they need to deliver homeless activists and organizers one another expansion of funding for tiny house villages, a proviso protecting the funding for tiny house villages so they cannot be used for any other purpose. This is crucial because year after year corporate mayors have done everything in their power to stand in the way of establishing dining halls, villages. So year after year, tiny house village funding has gone unused. This is predominantly been true under Mayor Durkan and I am concerned that the regional homeless authority will be no different because it is still part of the same political establishment, just another step removed from democratic accountability. And we already know of the ominous potential of the new rural administration as mayor, you really to really sort of crack down on homeless neighbors rather than actually providing humane services. We need to be crystal clear that homeless people themselves support tiny ice villages in a way that is unlike any other homeless service in Seattle. Year after year, dozens of dining halls, village residents and former residents who are now in permanent housing calling to the city council's public hearing to explain how tiny houses have transformed their lives . And I cannot say the same about any other service. This is not to say that other services are not important. They are tiny homes. Villages are something special. Of course, there are problems in tiny villages like everywhere, sometimes serious, sometimes tragic, because this is all happening as part of our deeply dysfunctional system of capitalism in the context of deep and increasing inequality. But to it all, tiny house villages have provided homeless residents with the community safety and dignity needed to begin to repair lives. When you face the devastating experience of homelessness and overcome the crushing isolation and alienation that comes with homelessness, I urge the Regional Homelessness Authority to rapidly expand Seattle standing house villages . But I am extremely anxious that it is not going to happen. And that's why I urge all the activists on the people's budget who are listening right now to keep in mind that we will need to continue fighting. My office stood with Nicole Small share a real and come second chance when they establish density communities and tiny house villages. Before, they had the legal authority to do so to the people's budget movement. Year after year, we won Seattle's first funding for tiny house villages. We want the legislation permitting. Villages in the first place and expanding the number permitted in Seattle. And we will continue to fight for tiny homes, villages and. And aside from that, also fighting to win the necessary funds for affordable social housing that Seattle needs to truly end homelessness. There are a lot of tiny house villages, real change organizers working alongside the people's budget campaign this year. One Funding for a new safe parking lot are people living in their vehicles. To be clear, people forced to be living in their vehicles because of the affordable housing crisis and skyrocketing rents. And also one the expansion of the garbage pickup and septic system pump out services for people living in Arby's on city streets. Most of the news coverage about the city budget deliberations has been about the police budget. If we were to only consider the objective material reality of police funding, the reality is it has changed very, very little over the past two years. The overwhelming majority of the changes have been superficial accounting mechanisms. For example, the biggest change in the police budget has been the costs of the 911 call center and parking enforcement have been moved to other departments. There is no material change. There is only a change on how it is accounted for. The material changes have all been extremely marginal. However, if we consider those material changes, there are deep lessons about how progressive change can be won and how big business maintains its power. Throughout history, it has been movements that make progressive change, not the machinations of the police political establishment not electing smart technocrats, not the relationships between elected officials. None of this actually helps progressive change, and very often than not can actually, more often than not, can be a hindrance to progressive change. Real change is driven by the balance of power in society as a whole, and particularly the organized forces of the working class prepared to fight. And those organized forces need elected representatives who will stand with them and boldly fight alongside them. The budget deliberations this year and last year could not be more different, and those differences are mirrored in cities across the country. One year ago, we were in the waning days of the Justice for George Floyd movement. In that context, and some members in Seattle and elected officials around the country claim to support defunding the police and funding community based safety alternatives. However, any sociologist will tell you that the one thing that has by far the greatest statistical impact on community safety and crime is the inequality in our society. And while it is important to note the impact of the movements in winning, citing an increased investment in community groups that do restorative justice work , there was no structural improvement in the overall inequality in society. In fact, we have to be sober. Over the last year, inequality has exploded, with billionaires getting even richer, with the majority of working class people having suffered all the burdens of the COVID recession. Seattle rents are now on track to increase and unconscionable 40% this year. That is just inhumane. That economic factor alone fully explains any increase in both homelessness and crime. But the ruling class does not want working people to fight for rent control. A real expansion in affordable housing and against inequality. So over the last year, there has been a brutal propaganda offensive against the BLM movement. We have seen this in all the big business owned mass media around the country, and it has gone hand in hand with the criminalization of the Black Lives Matter movement. Also on display last week with the outrageous acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, I watched a mayoral debate, Seattle mayoral debate just before the general elections, where every single question for the whole hour and a half posed to candidates was about crime and fear and all about fear mongering. This is not an accident. This is how the ruling class uses their power to control the political narrative. So while the police budget is roughly the same this year as it was last year, once you pass through the accounting tricks, it is being described by elected officials very differently than it was last year. This year, council members have gone to great lengths to say that the police budget is actually growing slightly, which in real terms is true. But what's what's striking about this is that council members are going overboard to make sure that everybody knows that the police budget is actually growing. That is a real contrast from last year. The same police budget would. But the same council members as being on track to defund the police by 50%, which was not true. Rhetoric aside, it is actually business as usual. But both last year and this year, what is missing is the sort of investment in affordable social housing that would be needed to actually push back the wave of inequality sweeping our communities. And what we know is coming, which is the phenomena of evictions. That is why I proposed increasing the Amazon tax to fully fund the affordable housing and Green New Deal building decarbonization work advocated for by the People's Budget and the Solidarity Budget. Unfortunately, seven of the nine Council members voted against adding this budget amendment to the agenda this morning, with only Council member Herbold and myself voting yes. For the past year, council members have congratulated themselves on the progressive revenue generated by what they call Jumpstart. But we need to be crystal clear every time progressive revenue is put to a vote, every time council members are put to a test, they vote no, except for one exception. That was in 2020, and that was because of the grassroots tax Amazon movement. This movement, which my office launched alongside a number of progressive labor unions and affordable housing organizations, had Action Conference after Action Conference, bringing hundreds and altogether thousands of ordinary people, working people, including struggling small business owners, Black Lives Matter activists and housing justice activists who all came together, discussed and debated openly. The points that we had to discuss and debate to make this about the movement that it became, which is a really strong movement. And in the midst of the Black Lives Matter protest, this tax Amazon movement collected 30,000 signatures on a viable ballot initiative to create a viable, credible threat of an even larger big business tax. Were the Council to fail to act out of those 30,000 signatures, 20,000 signatures were collected at the protest themselves in 20 days. Suddenly, after that happened, suddenly council members renamed a jumpstart and pretended that they supported it all along. But we need to be clear it was the grassroots movement that won the funding or the housing and the Green New Deal that exists in this budget. And it did. So this movement was able to do so despite repeated attempts by many council members to undermine that movement last year. And it is the political establishment who have prevented those big business taxes from being large enough to meet the needs of working people. And this year, again, as we said, as I said before, even though there has been an attempt from my office, from the People's Budget Movement to increase that Amazon tax that has been met with opposition, when we consider the budget as a whole, it does not do what it is necessary to do to meet the needs of regular working class people being priced out of the city. And that is not acceptable. For that reason, I will vote no as every year. I really appreciate the help of the City Council staff preparing budget amendments for my office and for the people's budget. Some of those efforts resulted in budget amendments that passed and became part of the budget, and others resulted in budget amendments that did not pass but were still extremely important for setting the stage for future victories. Dani Dyer. Tracy Radcliffe. Geoff Simms. Amy Gore. Peter Freeman. Tom Meisel, Greg Goss and Yolanda Ho all helped my office research and prepare a budget amendment, all coordinated by Ali Banerjee. And I greatly appreciate all your efforts. Thank you to all the staff members and community organizers and socialists in my office. Ted Walden. Adams and Koski. Nick Jones and Maura Gorey. Bill Larcombe and Jonathan Rosenblum. And thank you to everyone who was part of this year's US being part of this year's People's Budget Campaign. Special shout out to the low income seniors at the Rainier Court apartment complex who are so valiantly fighting their exploitative landlord side and for rent control and who also testified in support of the people's budget. Thank you. Council member so want. Council Member Lewis, you are next in the queue and I do not see any other hands raised. Go ahead, Councilor Lewis. Thank you, Madam President. I just want to extend a couple of brief remarks to first indicate my very deep appreciation to Chair Mesquita and her leadership and being incredibly accessible and accommodating throughout the budget process and hearing the various requests from from my office and from people in my district and reconciling a lot of those requests into this final budget. We are already getting a lot of people reaching out who are very pleased that their efforts on the Battery Street portal in the market to Mohi and other projects have resulted in some of those priorities getting into the budget and are very grateful to see that when a community comes together with a project in mind and puts their their shoulder to the wheel on it, something can ultimately come of that effort and really appreciate your process in allowing that to happen. I do want to state that I am certainly voting in favor of this budget today and appreciate the process that has gone into it. I do want to signal that for all of us here on the Council, I don't think I'm speaking just for myself to vote in favor of this budget does not necessarily signify agreement with every component, but does signify respect for the process, signify a willingness to go forward and have a budget that can keep the essential services of the city running and the continuation of our local democracy. Having gone through this very thorough process and I look forward to voting for it. There certainly are some components I would have liked to see changed. I feel that I was heard and having the completely transparent ability to bring forward amendments, to have my say on them and in some cases be successful, in some cases not. And I look forward to having the final passage on this to move forward and get to the work of implementing a lot of the things within the four corners of this budget in 2022. I want to close by also extending my thanks to Seattle City Council central staff. I'm always accessible, incredibly hard working. I don't know when our central staff sleeps. They seem to always be there and ready. Whenever I have a question and I really appreciate that accessibility, professionalism and the high quality of the work product throughout this process and other endeavors. I want to particularly thank our community as the budget manager for, you know, stressing all of the different parts into place throughout this process to keep us on track and congratulate our new central staff director, Esther Handy, on jumping in right at the beginning of this process and being able to keep everything running on time and meeting all of our deadlines. And I do finally want to I want to thank my team in my office throughout this effort for shepherding its proposals through. And every single one of them has multiple projects within this budget that are a result of their coalition building and diligent work in shepherding these projects. I want to thank Jacob Thorp for his work in designing with the King County Regional Homelessness Authority and getting a lot of our homelessness additions, homelessness service additions into this budget, including tiny house villages, high duty shelter provisos related to peer navigation. One thing to Neil Brown on my staff for her work on alternatives to policing and building up and developing the 911 call criteria is to set the stage for future non-police alternative dispatch from our Communications and Public Safety Center. I want to thank Parker Dawson for being the point person on some of those district projects I mentioned earlier for the Battery Street Portal and Market to Mohi. And I want to thank my colleague, in fact, a man of honor, for jumping in and really taking on a lot of the ministerial duties in the office as a replacement at the beginning of the budget cycle to really free up my other staff members to take on a bigger role in this budget process. So thank you. We really appreciate having you on board and in your work and helping with our office's communication strategies. So thank you so much with that. Madam President, I don't have anything else to add and appreciate being able to make some remarks. Councilmember Lewis, I have Councilmember Peterson in the queue next. And again, for anyone else, I'd like to give. Remarks, please. Thank you. Council President colleagues, as we know that crafting of Seattle's budget occurs during most of the calendar year, starting with proposals from each city department. I want to thank our mayor and her department heads and their teams and our city budget office under the leadership of Ben Noble and here, of course, in the legislative branch. Many thanks also to our city council central staff, our information technology team, the city clerks, the L.A. team, and my office for their strong work and many others for their work under the deadlines of our rigorous fall budget review process and especially grateful to our budget chairs, leadership and her grace in giving us the space to offer amendments and differences of opinion. As with all budgets that are crafted and amended by multiple teams with various perspectives and approaches, there are items that we and our constituents like, especially programs for those most in need in our council districts. And there are items that we might not like, especially as we debate how best to fund public safety, increase accountability, and deploy some effective alternatives to our traditional emergency response systems. Regardless, I believe we need a city budget approved and in place to keep our city government moving forward and in keeping our city moving forward. I'm especially grateful for the adoption today of Council 120224, which was the companion legislation for Council Budget Action Estimate 558002 to build back better with a boost to bridge bonds, bonds will enable us to finally address the growing backlog of vital bridge safety projects in the wake of the closure of the West Seattle Bridge and the subsequent audit of Seattle bridges that confirms many key bridges are in poor condition. We were reminded of this vulnerability with our the recent malfunctioning and temporary closure of the University Bridge, a multi-modal bridge that may someday be the key to installing a new bus rapid ride line and will enable us to fulfill more promises of a move. Seattle, by restoring some of that seismic upgrade projects, paused by our staff and can also increase safety on multiple bridges. On the project list we received from stocks, bonds can also boost the capital heavy line items identified by the city auditor as being historically underfunded. Authorizing these bonds will enable the incoming administration to seize the window of opportunity when interest rates are at historic lows. See, this city council delivers the authority for bridge bonds. And early next year we expect the new administration to use that authority to keep our infrastructure safe, to keep our economy moving, and to keep our communities connected . I will be voting yes on today's amended city budget. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Are there any other comments? The budgets and government are set up because you're the budget chair. I'm going to let you go last. So I'm looking for non. Budget Chair Committee comments. So council versus please. Thank you, Council President. Thank you, Chairman State. In this budget process, I set out with three broad priorities for District six investing in vibrant public spaces, addressing homelessness, and my top priority of providing citywide 24 seven response to mental health emergencies. For this top priority, colleagues, with your help, we secured $2.5 million to increase the size of the mobile crisis team so that there is an appropriate first responder for people in crisis in our community. This funding follows our work in my amendment last year to provide the first ever city funding for the Mobile Crisis Team, and it brings the total city investment from $0 two years ago to $3.5 million today. This budget also fully funds spd's staffing and hiring plans, expands community service officers health one, sets up triage one and invests in a study of the level of staffing required to ensure public safety on our waterways. In District six, this budget makes key investments, including $1,000,000 to install the children's playground at Ballard Commons Park. That was put on pause in 2019 by the pandemic funding to create the redesign of Ballard Avenue for Cafe Street that other districts can use, that redesign their districts to $3 million to clean up and remediate our parks. Funding to expand both the Phinney Neighborhood Association's hot meal program and the Vehicle Residency Outreach Program. And so much more for our district and our city. This was a difficult budget year and I did not get everything I wanted in this budget, as others have said as well. And I'm proud to pass this budget that moves our city forward out of this pandemic and starts 2022 by working together to build the Seattle we know we can be. I want to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues who worked with me or supported my priorities or even disagreed with my priorities. A special thank you to Council Member and Budget Chair Mosqueda for leading a smooth process that resulted in a balanced, fiscally responsible budget. Setting Seattle up for success, emerging out of an economic downturn and a period of political turmoil. I can't understate that enough. We have had a lot of political turmoil. We've seen as we experienced an economic recession and we came out set up for success with the budget before us. I want to thank central staff for everyone who worked with me on my amendments. I've been noble. Julie Dingley and your entire team. A huge thank you to you. And especially to my own team. Amanda, Noah, Kate and Lena. Thank you for your hard work on behalf of District Six and for the whole city. Thank you. Budget Chair and thank you, Council President. I look forward to voting yes on this budget. Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss. Any other council members interested in making comments on the budget? All right. I do have some comments I'd like to make before I handed over to Councilman Mosqueda to make closing remarks on this particular item. So, colleagues, today the Seattle City Council will pass an important 2022 budget amidst a public health emergency unlike any other in this century. As I wrap up my second and last term on the City Council, this is my final budget and I'm grateful to Budget Chair Mosqueda and each of you who agreed to co-sponsor my budget items this year. And over the past six years. I'm also grateful to current and former council members who have extended to me an opportunity to partner with you on your budget priorities as one of your co-sponsors. For me, I'm humbled that the budget chair must data included all but one of my budget priorities in her proposed balancing package . And I want to thank Budget Chair Mosqueda, who I am lucky enough to call a colleague, but even luckier to call a friend. And I also want to thank council central staff for their diligent work to identify and close a $15 million deficit that Mayor Durkan transmitted in her proposed budget, which was exacerbated by a revenue forecast update. That means we have less resources to meet the many needs for a livable, equitable and safe city for us all. I also want to thank my team, most of whom have been with me since my first term on this council. For all their tremendous work on this budget and on prior budgets, my Chief of Staff, Brandon Thomas. My Deputy Chief of Staff, Cody Writer, my senior policy adviser being when and my scheduler, Maria von Brunn and my past staff, Orlando Bernal, Genevieve Jones and Roxana Gomez, along with so many work study interns. Without each of their ability to bring tenacity and dedication to this really challenging work, none of the millions of dollars of investments achieved in this 2022 budget and past budgets would have been possible. So my deepest thanks and gratitude to each of them. This year's budget includes the following new and enhanced investments that we champion together with community partners and with your support colleagues. We expanded child care and safety net programs. There's an additional $1 million to support childcare providers, centers and in homes that will support providers stay licensed and enhance their ability to expand childcare slots to serve our children and their families. We have $200,000 in this budget to stoke and eventually launch a citywide guaranteed basic income pilot project. There's $661,000 to expand the legal defense fund to increase legal aid services to an anticipated increase in asylum cases in Seattle. There's $500,000 towards the Tubman Health Clinic, a black led community health clinic that will provide culturally responsive health care to Seattle's black community. And I was proud to be able to co-sponsor an additional $649,000 investment to strengthen digital equity and Internet access across the city. This budget also has more transit and green infrastructure. We advanced $545,000 to prioritize community engagement and education and environmental impact studies in the city's next comprehensive plan. Update that will guide city wide growth policies for the next decade at least. We have $100,000 to strengthen climate resilience strategies by ensuring that smoke shelters or cooling centers are within 15 minutes of every resident and worker in Seattle. There's a $2.5 million proviso to require that the Seattle Department of Transportation detail in the city wide transportation plan. How multi-modal plans like bicycle master plan, like the pedestrian master plan will be prioritized to pedestrianize and transform more more of our right of ways into vibrant public carbon free spaces. We've also addressed significantly additional funding for homelessness and mental health services. $600,000 in additional resources for the King County Regional Homelessness Authority. I was proud to be able to co-sponsor that with Councilmember Lewis and others. There's a new $5 million investment to establish a new high acuity shelter in coordination with King County to provide behavioral health services, an additional $100,000 to expand outreach to our neighbors living in vehicles , $600,000 to expand and enhance services in tiny house villages. $100,000 to expand hygiene services for camps. Second chance $600,000 for study of wages and our local human services workforce and a boost for workers worker pay for those on the front lines addressing our city's most pressing humanitarian crisis. We've also invested in public safety interventions and a trauma informed crisis response system. I was able to advance a proviso in the Seattle Police Department's budget to preserve underspend from salary savings that can be reinvested in community based alternatives to law enforcement. We also have $1.8 million proviso in the city attorney's office to ensure that free filing diversion programs and pretrial diversion programs and the Let Everyone Advance with Dignity program will continue to be part of the work we do as a city. Regardless of who is the city attorney. I'm proud of these achievements, even though by admission we did not achieve across the board success, including the close defeat of my abrogation amendment that would have advance transparency and budget accountability within the police department. Alas, the future Council will continue to struggle with holding the police department accountable to spending within its limits. In large part because the failure of my abrogation amendment means the future mayor and permanent chief will have the budget by which to hoard nearly $20 million worth of general fund dollars during a historic once in a lifetime global pandemic that continues to ravage our most vulnerable community members. But this is a battle that will most assuredly be for each of you to consider and debate and decide in the near future. So in closing, I'm grateful to have had such a meaningful opportunity to work with each of you, your staff, council, central staff, including our new director, Esther Handy, and her fearless budget manager, Allie Pucci. Also Patti Wigram, City Clerk's Office, I.T. communications staff and the Seattle Channel. This Thanksgiving, I have much to be grateful for. And among those items for which I am grateful. I give thanks for all of your hard work and your public service. Thanks to each of you for the opportunity to serve the people of this city together as a strong city council. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to hand it over to you now. That's the president. Thank you very much. Thank you for your service and your leadership on council. Thank you for the opportunity to work with you not just on this budget, but with your leadership and partnership on the Seattle rescue plan. And colleagues, thanks again to all of you for the work that you put into this budget. I will be very brief because the council president eloquently summarized the aspects within this budget that I am so proud of and I'm so thankful for all of your ongoing participation to have been able to get to this point today, to have that extensive summary that you just heard reflected in our final budget as we pass this, the Council 2022 budget response to these most pressing crises facing our city in the wake of COVID and in the wake of rising income inequality, by investing a historic amount of funding in affordable housing and sheltering more of those who are experiencing homelessness and ensuring equitable economic recovery, investing in public safety. And, as Councilmember Suarez noted, getting back to the basics, making sure that we're investing in libraries and parks. This council budget rightly invests in more emergency reserves while prioritizing spending limited public dollars to serve, care for and support working families and our local economy. Thanks very much to the foresight of this Council to continue to support the implementation plan. From the jump start progressive revenue. We are able to leave with progressive values in this Budget Act with urgency to ward off any deep cuts and protect our most vulnerable in this time of compounding public health crises. I am proud and proud of the ways in which we have come together as a council and proud of the ways in which we are coming together as a city. We are making important decisions for our city in the face of very bad economic forecasts received just weeks ago. And as chair, I have always been committed to a transparent and accountable budgeting process. After reviewing the nearly 200 amendments to the proposed budget colleagues, together we have crafted a budget that invests in the areas of most need. I want to continue to thank my council colleagues and sincerely express my appreciation for your difficult work that you've put into making sure that our most urgent needs are met in this budget cycle. And we will continue to work to address those needs that will potentially manifest in 2022. We will be more prepared to do so because of the work you have done to protect the reserves and to prepare for those situations that may be on the horizon. I will also work with the next administration to address any emerging needs and work swiftly to make sure that our city has what it needs to be responsive to the tremendous gamut of needs across our great city of Seattle. We've worked tirelessly over the last two months. We've also worked tirelessly over the last two years in the midst of this pandemic, to truly identify every dollar that could be used in 2020, to get it out the door as fast as possible, and in partnership with the state partners and our federal congressional members to respond to the emergency that COVID has not created but has made worse in terms of economic instability and housing instability. I greatly appreciate the work you've done here, colleagues. I'm proud of the investments in stability, safety and care for Seattleites. We are adjusting for some of the most unprecedented times our city, our country has ever faced. And we are doing this by investing in affordable housing, responding to the homelessness crisis, creating equitable and safe communities, and creating a future that our city can be proud of by investing in economic resilience. I look forward to working with you to implement these important components. And I want to thank you again for all of your work. I did my thank you this morning, Madam President, but I want to again thank central staff and my team who have been just tremendous. So thank you all for your consideration.

Please refrain from profane or obscene speech. Direct your comments to council as a whole and please refrain from individual or personal attacks. Councilman Cashman, will you please put council vote eight for eight on the floor? Yes, Mr. President. I move the Council Bill 18 0848 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Constable A4 is open. May we have the staff report? Indeed. Good evening. My name is Andrew Johnstone with the Department of Finance working on special districts. I'm bringing the staff report to you today for Council Bill 848 series of 2018 for an ordinance approving two service plans for new metropolitan districts supporting redevelopment of the parcel of land known as West Lot Site. The districts are called West Lot Metropolitan District Number one and West Lot. Metropolitan District number two. The service plans are being submitted for City Council approval on behalf of the Colorado Rockies Baseball Club Limited pursuant to the requirements of the Special District Act, Sections 32, Dash one, Dash 201 and more particularly 32. Dash one, dash two of 4.5 of the Colorado Revised Statutes. The service plans contain the district's purpose, powers, requirements and financing plan. The district shall be responsible for compliance with the city's municipal code rules, regulations and policy and all other applicable law. The District shall ensure that the District's public improvements are designed and constructed in accordance with the standards and specifications of the city and of other governmental entities having jurisdiction. The purpose of the new development on the West Lot site is to create a sustainable revenue stream over time, which can contribute towards capital improvements and repairs at Coors Field without having to go to the taxpayers for additional funding. The new metropolitan districts will facilitate the needed public improvements and financing required to prepare the West Lot site for vertical developers. It is anticipated that the West Lot Metropolitan District Number one will be the coordinating district organized to finance, construct, own, manage and operate the public improvements for the West Lot site. The West Lot Metropolitan District number two will be organized as a financing district in order to cooperate with district number one to generate revenue to pay costs for public infrastructure. The new metropolitan districts will be responsible for creating the financing, acquisition, construction, completion operation and maintenance of all public infrastructure and services within and without the service areas, including without limitation street sidewalk improvements, parking infrastructure, water storm drainage detention and sanitary sewer improvements, landscaping, irrigation, a public plaza and traffic and safety control improvements. The new metropolitan districts will have the power to raise revenue pursuant to the authorities granted by the Special District Act, including the imposition of up to 60 mills plus rates, fees, tolls and charges for debt and district operation maintenance. Once the district imposes a debt levy, the district operations and maintenance mill levy cannot exceed ten mills. The new metropolitan districts will also be authorized to impose up to five mills or regional improvements at the discretion of the city and county of Denver. The total estimated cost of the public improvements necessary to serve the contemplated development is approximately 32,600,000. In order for the new metropolitan districts to have the fiscal wherewithal to provide the funding for the upfront costs of the public improvements needed in the service area, then the new metropolitan districts shall have the ability to issue debt and impose a debt. No levy to provide the funding. At completion. At completion. The current plan projects a residential and commercial mixed use development of approximately 675,000 square feet. The development plans generally consist of hotel office buildings, residential condos and retail uses. There is a pending rezoning application with the Community and Planning Department. Approval of the service plan establishes the following There is sufficient and sufficient existing and projected need for organized service in the area. Existing service in the area is inadequate for president and projected needs. The districts are capable of economically providing sufficient service to the area within the proposed boundaries. The land in the proposed development to be included does not or does and will have the financial ability to discharge the proposed indebtedness on a reasonable basis. And the facility and service standards will be compatible with the facility and service standards of the city and county of Denver. Staff recommends approval of these service plans and the applicant and their representatives are here to answer questions you might have. Thank you very much. We do have four individuals signed up to speak this evening. When I call your name, come on up to the podium and your 3 minutes will start. First up, we have Elizabeth Cortis. Good evening. My name is Elizabeth Curtis and I am here on behalf of the applicants as. Legal counsel and. Spelling of my last name is C.O. RTC Address 450 East 17th Avenue, Denver, Colorado 80237. And I'm available to answer any questions you may have. All right. Thank you very much. Next up, how Roth. Good evening. My name is Hal Roth and the chief financial officer of the Colorado Rockies. And I'm here to answer any questions you might have you may address. If you're comfortable otherwise of 2001 Blake Street. All right. Thank you very much. Next up, John Young. No whiskey ski. My name's John Yanna, Shoe Ski, and I am with Stantec Architecture. We're the architects. And planners for the West Light project. And just how said, we're here to answer any questions. My address is 3725 East Seventh Avenue, Denver. Thank you very much. And last up, Shaun Bailey. Good evening. Sean Maley, CRL Associates, 1660 Lincoln, Denver. We've been working with the project team on the. Community outreach front and likewise. Here to answer any questions you might have. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of Council Councilman Brooks? And thank you, Mr. President. I just want the African or Sean I don't know if you want to do it. Just give us a little bit of the vision of as to why a metro district for this area and some of the improvements that are going to be applied here. Thank you, Councilwoman Brooks. First, I think I. Need to explain. Quickly why we are doing this project, and that is to provide capital funding for Coors Field for the next 30 years under our new stadium lease. With that said, the Metro District will help us. To finance this project. And provide the. Benefits of one a public space that will be built in the middle of it, what we call the Content Plaza. Help us to redo the wine coop walkway, which accesses the stadium, as you know, from Union Station. On into the left field gate. And thirdly, to. Help us. Improve the streetscape around on 19th Y, Z, and also on 20th, where we will try to improve the unsightly retaining wall. Great. And can you, for folks who don't know, kind of talk about the gap, the financial gap in funding the stadium? Yes, I would be glad to. When we were renegotiating. With the stadium district and as I think you're all aware, the. Denver Metropolitan Major. League Baseball Stadium District, a creation of the state, is the owner of Coors Field and we were negotiating to extend the lease for 30 years last year began and were successful began at the end of March of last year. The issue going forward. Was we needed to do capital. Improvements to the stadium. The issue is replacing mundane things like concrete ramps, steel sewer pipes and scoreboard seats. When you have a building that's half outside deteriorates quicker than a building fully enclosed. There were no funding sources for that. So we seized on the idea, along with the stadium district of developing the West slide and to provide essentially a profit that would be funneled back in to the capital repairs fund. I think in your materials you have. What we're paying forward. In rent each year to provide. $125 million. And then through our stadium lease, which would generate another 75 million over the 30 year period. Those combined will add up to the $200 million that we estimate by to engineering firm studies as the necessary capital. Very helpful. I'm glad that you explain that. I think there are a lot of folks in the public who kind of, number one, don't know the relationship with the stadium district. And number two, didn't know the gap, the financial gap that you guys are experiencing. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Brooks seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 848 is closed. Comments by members of Council. Councilman Brooks. Yep. I'll just say, I think, you know, metro districts even known as Andrew at some point in the next metro district, I've never seen so many come through. But it is a it's an important financial financing mechanism, especially on a situation like this, where we do have an asset owned owned by the community. But to keep the improvements to to see the development improve, we need a financing source that will redevelop. And so, I mean, you know, I'm supportive of this. I'm excited for my colleagues and the city to actually see the plan. The Rockies have have done a phenomenal job and with one of the tougher neighborhoods in the city of LoDo in and really soliciting their feedback, getting their input and even changing a lot of their design for what the neighborhood's been saying. So I really appreciate you guys reaching out to the neighborhood and working with them and go Rockies October. That's it, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Brooks.

Members of the City Council, my friend Cassidy. I live on Bay Street and I'm opposed this ordinance for several reasons. First off, I believe it's a dishonest ordinance. It's purporting to be about the safety of the food supply. And yet, when Council member Odie broached this months ago, the only thing he discussed was layoffs at a particular grocery store. Secondly, it's about an imagined problem, not a real problem. There's, you know, predictions that Wal-Mart's going to be taking over grocery stores. But are they doing that? No, it just we're just guessing that's going to be a problem. But my biggest concern is the message it gives to the business community. We have significant vacancies in office space. We have significant vacancies in retail space. We got to populate Alameda Point with tenants at some point. And here we are telling the business community that our city council will enact rules about how they can hire and fire people. It's not a real welcoming thing. It can turn businesses off. And I think in the long run, it might actually result in fewer jobs in Alameda. So those are my concerns. Thank you. You. There are a number like to move adoption of. Item five. F I f think you. A second. Is there any discussion? So I'd like to share that. This this it's my understanding this is being brought to us to approve because there's a California state case that went up to the California state Supreme Court. Supporting the proposition that it is to provide safe food supply to our community. And I and I don't want to speak for the other council members, but we have had discussion about that and. And in the end, it only applies to stores that are over 15,000 square feet. Groceries as a high percentage of the store has to have food items. Is there anything else that's particularly true that does not provide pertain to stores across the community is very limited. All right. All those in favor. I a motion passes unanimously. Thank you. Regular agenda items. Six A receiver report on the Mastic Senior Center 2014 Annual Report.","Final Passage of Ordinance Amending the Alameda Municipal Code by Adding Chapter VI, Article XIII, Section 6-56 to Impose Requirements Relating to the Retention of Grocery Workers in Certain Circumstances involving the Transfer of Ownership of Large Grocery Establishments.  (Community Development 7010)","Here is a structured summary of the key points from the presentation:

Core Objectives and Proposals:
- Enact an ordinance regulating hiring/firing practices at large grocery stores (over 15,000 sq ft) that primarily sell food items.
- The stated intent is to provide a safe food supply for the community.

Underlying Rationale and Justifications:
- Responds to a California Supreme Court case upholding such ordinances for food safety purposes.
- Driven by concerns over potential mass layoffs at a particular grocery store chain.
- Aims to prevent disruptions that could theoretically impact the safety and security of the food supply chain.

Relevant Background Context: 
- Pushed by Council member Odie months ago, initially framed around preventing layoffs at one store.
- Concerns raised that it sends an unfriendly signal to businesses about regulating hiring/firing.
- Applicable only to very large grocery stores over 15,000 sq ft with high percentage of food sales.
- Passed unanimously by City Council despite opposition voicing it as an overreach targeting an ""imagined problem.""

In summary, it is a local ordinance aiming to regulate labor practices at major grocery retailers under the stated reasoning of ensuring food safety and supply chain security, though opposition argues it unnecessarily inserts the city into businesses' workforce decisions based on a hypothetical future scenario.",0.865,"Engage in free-form, substantive reasoning to deeply grasp the complete ideas, logical flow, and contextual factors first.

- The core objectives and proposals
- The underlying rationale and justifications
- The relevant background context

Then, provide a concise yet structured summary clearly conveying the vital elements for effective stakeholder communication.

So let's. Madam Clerk, please go ahead and pull up item number 31, please. Communication from Councilmember Super, not a recommendation to receive and file a report from hospitality industry representatives on recently released infographic related to their contributions to the Long Beach economy. Thank you, Councilmember Supernova. If you'd like to make that motion, you have the floor. King. I am going to make that motion later. It's not it's not hooking up for me. So it machine's not quite working. But you have a floor. All right. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I have just a very brief statement to read prior to the presentation. This will set the stage for our presenters. This agenda item originated a few months ago at a city council meeting during public comment. Several hotel employees spoke about workplace issues at some of our local hotels. Whether or not it was specifically stated, I believe the inference by virtue of the fact that they were speaking at the podium is that hotel management was not hearing the concerns. That is what struck me as I listened to the testimony. The idea that management wasn't listening did not comport with my experience in working with hospitality industry clients over many years. I have never met anyone in hospitality management who wasn't keenly aware of the fact that they are in a people industry. And a corollary to that fact is that employee satisfaction can be directly connected to guest satisfaction. It didn't make any sense to me that management was not hearing and reacting to employee concerns. But I'm not the expert here. So I thought it would be beneficial to invite our local industry representatives to present to council in order to benchmark their current initiatives and contributions to the Long Beach economy. So we'll have a total of four speakers. And first up will be Jeremy Harris of the Greater Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. I don't know. Did you want to? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I. Test. There we go. Thank you. Council member, vice mayor, council members and city staff. Jeremy Harris, senior vice president with the Long Beach Area Chamber of Commerce. And also, I serve as the staff liaison to the Long Beach Hospitality Alliance. I'm here tonight to. Talk to you about along with the industry that they represent. It's a pleasure to give a report on some recent. Information we and data that we've collected regarding the alliance and the hoteliers. And industry that they represent. The Alliance aims to represent local hospitality industry made up of major. Hotels in Long Beach area. Many of them are with us here tonight as well. They include the Hilton Hotel, Maya, the Renaissance, Long Beach, Marriott Airport, Holiday Inn. Long Beach Airport, Courtyard Marriott downtown, the residence in Marriott Courtyard Marriott. Long Beach Airport, Holiday Inn residence in downtown and the residence. In airport. To give you a snapshot of who we're talking about tonight. These are all good. Corporate citizens that provide great paying jobs and call Long Beach Home. We also appreciate the upward mobility they provide in terms of career oriented jobs and while giving back to the. Community in various ways, which I know many of us hear about, and we'll hear a little bit more here shortly. In fact, before we bring up another speaker, I'd like to share a brief video that was produced. Just a few months ago highlighting just a few of our members. And what they do. For their team members and the community. If we can have the video, please. When I started working for hospitality, I have no idea what I was getting into it. But I don't regret a minute choosing this career because it is the best career that anybody can work on. I'm surrounded by people who. Inspire me and bring me to the next level. It really makes me feel comfortable and empowered. To work in an environment like. This. Holiday Inn means to me the word holiday, and we take every day like it is a holiday with our guests and also that our associates is like family who is like a family away from my own family. Spent a lot of time here and I build relationships not with just my associates, but also with my kids. I've been a part of the Intercontinental Hotel family for a long time now, and working at the Holiday Inn here in Long Beach is just very rewarding because it's a wonderful project with the renovation and new restaurant coming up. And also, obviously for me, it's a great challenge that I'm facing with with prime me. Retro hierarchy. And they load them for me so I can travel hockey therapy, animal, roadside hotel, raffle and Ambien, things like that get that are like on vinyasa that that hierarchy, the lobotomy the Renaissance means for me job security and professionally. I've developed myself over the years learning and developing myself, taking care of your guests and taking care of my employees. I'm proud to work in this place. We have great opportunities to. Grow in this company and also we have benefits. We have a great environment and all those because. Our management gave us all the support we need. Our favorite thing about coming to work every morning here at the Holiday. Inn is to meet colleagues that are as enthusiastic as myself to get the job done right. I think it's really important to. Work in. An environment that you see as fit for yourself. We are all very much leaders in our own way. We're very unique. We all get along and we are all friends, which is sometimes hard in the. Workplace, but at the end makes. Coming to work even that more special. Thank you. As you see, it's just a snapshot of three of the hotels that make up the alliance and represent the community. To further expand upon our presentation this evening, I'm going to call up Christy Allen, VP of hotel operations for Ensemble Hotels, and Jim of the Hotel Maya. Thank you, Jeremy. Thank you, vice mayor and council members. We, the hoteliers, want to take this opportunity before all of you to speak about the collective impact of the hospitality industry within the community of Long Beach. The information behind you on the screen titled Long Beach Hospitality Industry by the Numbers is a snapshot of just some of the lesser known attributes of our industry, specifically the hotels that we would like to share with you and ensure that these are at the forefront in any conversations about the hotels and our industry here in Long Beach. Advocacy and advocating for sustaining a collective economic growth for it for our industry is one of the three pillars and a focal point in the mission of the Long Beach Hospitality Alliance. You'll see total dollars up there. Transient occupancy tax or TLT, as commonly referred to, is a vital component of our city budget. As you all know, total has been growing the past few years to over $26 million in 2016 through growth in both our hotel occupancy rates and average daily rates for Long Beach this year, we are seeing positive numbers that should produce stronger Totti than 2016, which of course is a good thing for Long Beach. Many factors, including the continued investment our owners make an existing hotels through renovations, upgrades and improvements, and the city's investment in our convention center has aided in this growth. But while 2017 forecast forecasts may look strong now, we must remain alert to outside influence or government interference with additional laws that could severely impact the health of our hotels and cause issues for not only the hotels but the city. In terms of reduced transient occupancy tax, that affects everyone's bottom line. The second pillar of our mission for the alliance is one that always has been and always will be the most important key to our longevity and success investing in our people, our team members through trainings and benefits. The numbers you see on the screen are quite revealing. 82% of our hotel employees reside in Long Beach. Almost 50% have ten or more years with their current hotel. I personally have two housekeepers who just pass their 40 year mark at the Meyer. Meyer must be a pretty fabulous place to work. Many hotels have second and third generations of family members working in the same hotel from entry level jobs as interns, high school or college students. The hotel industry has been one of the few employers that has always offered incredible opportunity for growth from within. In fact, many of the general managers and staff here this evening began their career as hourly employees in a hotel. I myself started as a restaurant hostess. Continuing with supporting our team members. Our alliance has done this through education and professional training in the past year. As you'll see on the screen, the Alliance has successfully sponsored professional training courses for over a thousand team members on topics such as recognizing human trafficking, personal defense safety, training, CPR, first aid and emergency procedures during an active shooter or terrorist attack. Our trainings have been conducted by professionals and have included that have included the Department of Homeland Security. These trainings are extremely well received and now serve as a hallmark of our ability to leverage our collective energies to develop and protect our team members. So much so, we are considering opening future trainings to other businesses in the hospitality industry, such as restaurants and small business or our vendors. The third pillar of our alliance is community service. The very same community in which we do business and provide jobs. Long Beach has one of the highest concentrations of nonprofit organizations, and we are proud to partner with many of these organizations by assisting in their fundraising efforts with food and auction donations. Employee participation in various community service events. And partnering with these organizations where we can to improve our community. We have done everything from building new playgrounds. To feeding thousands for Thanksgiving at a community center each year, to helping to provide equipment for school gyms, beach cleanups, and providing rooms and meals for families in need at Long Beach Memorial, just to name a few. There are literally hundreds of other requests and events we participate in in each of your council districts. Some of these organizations are highlighted in the bottom left of the slide above. Combine all of these efforts with our involvement through our national brands. Our hotels have been recognized collectively through our individual hotels. National Brand Awards, the Marriott has received has been recognized for being one of the top 50 companies in the country for diversity. One of the top companies for executive women, the LGBTQ Business Equality Award, an employer of the year from Latina style, a national magazine for professional Hispanic women. The Hilton brand has been recognized as a top company for diversity as well. Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index of 100 100 Companies Providing the most opportunities for Latinos. Top Diversity Employee As noted by Black Empowerment and Entrepreneur Journal magazine. These are just a few of the recognitions and awards. Some of our brands in Long Beach have garnered nationally, as hotels in general are known as a great place to work for many across both our city and America. We have a list of benefits also offered among our hotels to our team members on the slide. Our common pillars, as summarized tonight of advocacy, education and community, are not new to hoteliers who are with us tonight. These have been core components of all of our brands, and we continue to strengthen each in Long Beach. And while we are certainly competitors, we share a common passion for our team members and the spirit to serve others. It's in the DNA of our industry as well as the DNA in all of us. With that, I'd just like to ask our folks in the hospitality industry that are with us tonight, who work for a hotel , support our industry or a combination of both. To please stand. We appreciate all of you who have made the time to be with us tonight. Now you may be seated. Now allow me to introduce to you Jennifer Robinson, who has called the. Long Beach Marriott home. Near the airport, her career home for 28 years. She started as an hourly employee and now manages their largest apartment in the hotel. Her story is only one that exemplifies what we do each and every day here in Long Beach. Good evening, Vice Mayor Richardson and the honorable council members. My name is Jennifer Robinson. I started my career at the Long Beach Marriott in 1989 as assistant restaurant manager. Later, as I grew in my position, I became the restaurant manager and then director of services. Restaurant. In 1998, I was promoted and currently working as Director of services. I have worked in the front of the house as well as the back of the house. Each has its own reward, but nothing more rewarding than seeing hardworking people. Housekeepers come in each and every day. It was clear that in this industry I was not going to be wealthy in the bank, but wealthy in my heart by simply working with my staff building relationships. Some days that means taking off my jacket and getting in the dirt with them. Just to get the job done. When our occupancy goes up, we are able to offer overtime as a benefit by posting the information on the board to anyone who is interested. Just to make it happen for us. And they do that with a smile. The training that is offered at the hotel I have been able to promote within the department and then the hotel to supervisory positions and also management positions in our business. We have to be able to depend on each other as family should. So more than just 28 year career, it's become a way of life. It's become a family to me. So many times I've been asked, why stay at a location for so long? And in just a few words I can tell you. It's the people. It's the. Company. The support from my general manager Imran Ahmad, to the Executive Committee on down. It's paramount to what we need to achieve by taking care of not only our guest but as well as our associates. I thank you. And now I would like to introduce our general manager, Imran Ahmed, of the Long Beach Marriott Hotel. Jennifer. Thank you, Jennifer. Thank you, Christy. Good evening, Vice Mayor Richardson and our honorable city council members, Imran Ahmed, general manager at the Long Beach Marriott, concluding our little presentation. We understand open communication and collaboration between hospitality leaders and the city council members is paramount to have a seamless and solid policy. Therefore, we stand here before you to provide you with some specific update on how aggressively we acted upon some of the comments that were made here 18 months ago in public comment and what we have done to enhance our employees public safety seminars. As Christy already mentioned, one of the ones that was highly, very, extremely well received by our associates was the one recommended by Councilwoman Mongo in self-defense. Over 600 associates attended that in downtown and in Long Beach Airport. Maryanne Panic buttons were issued to all housekeeping associates. Unwanted sexual advances by guests. This is something we do not take lightly. Immediately actions are taken, if there are any. Immediately. There has been some overtime concerns that associates have been asked to work overtime. As mentioned, overtime schedule requests are published. If any of our associates can work and help us out. They do so. And over time, compensation is paid in accordance to state and federal laws. Retaliation from management towards associates if they complain about something preposterous. Every hotel in Long Beach and around the country has specifically laid out rules and regulations how retaliation is dealt with within the hotel industry. And let me take this opportunity, opportunity to read verbatim from ones that we give to our associates. The hotel, and I quote, the hotel will not tolerate against you for filing complaint and will not tolerate or permit retaliation by management associates or fellow associates. Let's make no mistake. Safety and welfare of our employees is very important, and we do not take this lightly. We will choose. Hospitality management and are still here after three decades because we are people centric advocates at core. Our guests and our employees are why we choose to lead businesses where we could make a difference. 24 seven. 365. Finally tonight, the Hospitality Associates leaders have come together to remind everyone that we do not need a local ordinance to take care of our employees. It is what's required of us as supervisors, managers and owners. I thank you once again for giving us the opportunity. Thank you. Councilmember, you want to conclude? Okay. I'd like to thank the speakers tonight and all the folks in the audience, the hotel workers who showed up. Appreciate you being here. And also, I'd like to mention that we appreciate that you were here last week and we weren't able to accommodate you speaking. But thanks for being here tonight. I guess that's what we might call a concierge service. So I'd like to turn it over to my colleagues. I would ask for your support on this item. Thank you. Thank you. And I'll just. I'll just chime in and say thank you, Daryl, for for this presentation this evening and to everyone who works, no matter what you do. We do understand the importance of this industry here. And we want to say that we do appreciate all of you, whether it's you are the people we interact with on a policy level like Kristi or our or Jeremy or the people that we know are doing the hard work on the front lines, the housekeepers and the staff that that make sure that people have a great experience and would praise me. And, you know, we just had our My Brother's Keeper summit at Hotel Maya, which is my favorite hotel in Long Beach. And I'm not shy about it. You know, we had My Brother's Keeper Summit, and it was great that folks from all across the West Coast received top notch service in a beautiful waterfront hotel. And we felt good about what that represented, that the fact that there's, you know, that we can offer such accommodations with, you know , with a certain level of respect for our workforce. And so we're really proud. We're really proud of that. And that's something that I take pride in our city. So we have some comments from the city council here. First, we have Councilwoman Price. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I share your share in your comments. I have to say a very impressive presentation tonight. So thank you for the Hospitality Alliance for organizing it. This group has really impressed me in terms of how they have been able to collaborate together and provide such amazing benefit to the city. The first is to the consumer. The the hotels in the city of Long Beach offer, in my opinion, the best service. And they really have stepped it up in the last few years in terms of decor. Food. Quality, all the things that visitors to the city are looking for in terms of finding a good destination and a a place to stay that is aligned with the quality of the city in terms of what we're trying to strive for. And the hotels have really done that. It's a changing industry. It is changing. Very. Rapidly. And I think our hotels, through this alliance and through their relationship with our business partners, have really done a good job of staying ahead of those trends and making sure that their employees have job security because the hotels continue to do well in terms of attracting clients. So I think that's fantastic. I think it's the community involvement in terms of supporting the council districts in every district is also something that I think makes you you don't just say that you're a good corporate citizen in the city of Long Beach. You actually live it. You are vested in our community in everything that you do. You support our community events and programs financially and through our volunteer efforts, which are very much appreciated. And I think that demonstrates not just the words that you're a good corporate partner, but that the actions that you participate in support that. I think it's important to also note the presentation and the efforts that are being made by the hotel industry to not only retain good employers and good employees, but to be good employers. I think hearing from Jennifer was really eye opening to me. Jennifer to me, is is is the model or the story of what we will want for any industry? I mean, I know tonight we're just talking about the hotel industry, but really, when we talk about the relationship of trust that she's built with her employer, the path of upward movement that's been created for. Her, the. Opportunities to earn more money through over time for her employees that she talked about, that's not available in every industry. So the fact that you make that available to your employees is is definitely something that is, I think, in my opinion, noteworthy. And just hearing her talk about her experience from a firsthand personal level is is really impactful for me. You know, I represent a business improvement. A district that is very much thriving. It's a hospitality based industry in that we have lots of food service opportunities and and business owners in that area. And I think hearing some of the commitment tonight from the hotel operators and not just hearing their commitment, but seeing the data in terms of everything they have done to provide a safe work environment that provides for upward movement in a supportive environment is something that I would hope every employee in every industry would have the opportunity to be experiencing. So I'm grateful for the presentation tonight. I think taking the proactive steps that Imron talked about in terms of some of the concerns that may be raised on a policy issue and addressing those impracticality, I think speaks volumes to your commitment to being a good employer in the city of Long Beach and above all , just being a good human being to your employees. I think that's really important. I hope that every employee who's in here tonight feels that with their employer, and if not, what I'm hearing and what I know to be true is that we have in the city of Long Beach employers that are very approachable, at least in the hotel industry. Not every employee in every category of workforce has those same protections. And I think at the end of the day, that's that's really important to think about, right. If we're talking about protecting employees, why, you know, it's important to look at just your industry. But how about employees all over in every industry? So thank you very much for the presentation. I thank my colleague, Councilman Super for sponsoring this item and I'm glad that all of you are here at council meeting tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Andrews. Yes, thank you, Vice Mayor. I looked up at the clock and I said, oh, not another one. It has a quarter to nine. But that's not that's not it. So I wanted to see someone. You know. I think it was sort of the court. Yes. So I want to thank Mr. Soup enough for bringing this information forward. I also would like to give a special congratulations to the Hilton choir. Keebler will receive an annual award for the CP and for all of the other hotels who participated in my Given with a thankful heart. I want to totally, totally thank you for what you do because you are feeding over thousands of people and not just for the sixth District, but that's for the city of Long Beach. And again, I would think all the hotels who come in and help me with that each year. Thank you again very much. And keep up the good work. Thank you, Councilmember Mongo. Thank you. I appreciate that you took the time. 18 months ago to come in and meet and ask serious. Questions about the things that you thought the council would recommend to do to meet the needs of the community. And for you to put your money where your mouth is and. Train 600 individuals on defensive tactics. And then further to hear that you use. The same trainer that the sheriff's department uses to make sure that your staff were getting. Quality training, not just a fluff course to meet the perception you actually did the real hard work to bring people together. I talk, I go to the hotels regularly, all of them. I noticed. In the video that some of the. Shots of those hotels are actually older and you've done significant renovations just even in the last three years. If you haven't been to the new Holiday Inn or the. New. Restaurant on the top floor, those are all huge improvements to the community. When people drive down the four or five freeway, they see that and it is a icon which has a historical relevance and this city and the management of that hotel has chosen to keep it. Not all such organizations have done that. They've knocked many of them down. Every hotel in my district has had major improvements in the last three years, and I can tell that when I walk in the door. And I think that that. Change on the outside creates a place of pride to work for. And I appreciate that you put that money back into the organization. I'd also say that. You're doing an excellent job if you allow. People to volunteer for overtime. Because in a lot of industries, even in our own police force, we have order in. We have a need. We have fireworks. There aren't enough police officers to we could not hire enough police officers to meet the demand for some of those peak seasons. And the seasonality of the hotel industry has some great, great swings in it. And for you to. Be able to offer that kind of opportunity for overtime still. Is really, really meaningful. And then thirdly, 82% of your employees are Long Beach residents. Mr. West, would you guess that 82% of our own city employees would be Long Beach residents? Because I think that that might exceed our own numbers. Would you do we know? Likely. Likely that. That's impressive. That's higher than anything else. We're working on project labor agreements where we're hoping to get numbers that are much lower and we're not even using just Long Beach zip codes. We're using the region. So for you to have an 82%, that really speaks to Long Beach residents that are here day in and day out, playing in our parks, going to our schools, their kids are taking care of because their parents have a place to work. And that's that's really impressive. So I want to thank you for the work you've done. I think that it really is a a whole story you've presented here today. And thanks for the 4 million increase in tax revenue. We really needed it this year. And if you could just give us a little more next year, we have a small deficit we're facing. So let's get those occupancy rates above 80% and give those employees some opportunity for overtime. Second, Councilmember Pearson. Yes, thank you. And I want to thank my colleague Mr. Super and. All Councilmember. Super Rubinoff for highlighting what makes my district really awesome is our tourism and our hotels. I want to thank the Hospitality Alliance for coming in and doing this presentation. I think that we, you know, have been having. A lot of discussions about how Long. Beach has been changing over the last ten years. And we look at the CVB and we look at our hotels and. How much tourism is changing. And I'm proud to say that I've had the opportunity to meet several times with not only the CVB, but almost every single. Hotel, major hotel in our city, except. For one that's in my district to sit down and talk about that conversation. Right. The fact that we've had. Workers come and speak and tell one story and we hear another story and we know that the truth often is. Somewhere. In the middle. Right. We know that. We know that our job as counsel is to hear all. Sides and to sit down and have a conversation. About what's best for our city. And I think that's what's been great, is that a lot of the hotel management has sat down and said, we hear these concerns, here's kind of where we're at and where we're going. And so I really look forward to continuing this conversation and finding out where is that truth in the middle and great that you guys have put in place. Some safety measures and. Some trainings. The fact that we've had you say 606 hundred people attend a safety class. To me, that's a little bit of a flag that says we need this, right? That when we have. Housekeepers knocking on bedroom doors by themselves, we need this training. And so thank you for doing that. And I hope that we can figure out, you know. Where does that leave our hotel workers feeling today? And is there something that needs to move forward to continue their safety. That we can assist with? I also want to say that I think that that 82 number, that 82% number, is something that is really great. When we worked on Measure. N in. 2012, that was part. Of the the discussion that we have hotel companies that come in our city and are great and they give us great numbers in total. I'm super glad to see those numbers on the rise, but that we know whenever we pay a hotel worker a dollar and a living wage, that's $3 back in our community and we've seen our communities change in the last ten years. And so I really want to thank the hotels for for being here, for being good partners. I haven't had the chance to have you guys volunteer in any of our CD2, you know. Clean ups or anything like that. So I look forward to that in the future. I think our industry is really strong. I know we have a lot of discussions about new hotels coming to the city, particularly in my district, and some conversations around the top. So I look forward to having those conversations. With you as well as talking about. The industry and the health of our employees that are in the in that industry. And I know that some of the hotels you highlighted up here are also my favorites, the Maya. And that you guys have done a really great job of partnering with your employees and hearing from them. And so I look forward to some more of that discussion in the future. And again, I want to thank my colleague for bringing this discussion up because it was. Part of one of the things that I wanted to bring up. And have just this very conversation about the health of our industry and how strong it is right now. So thank you, everybody. I'd also like to to say one last thing. A lot of folks know in the room that I probably more. Than maybe I think was a. Hotel worker. As I write, Councilmember Andrews understands the industry probably more than anybody. But in my nine. Years of working with hotel workers, I had the opportunity to do a. Day in the life to go. In and kind of see what it's like to be a hotel worker. And so. I encourage anybody that has. That opportunity to do that. And maybe some of hotel management would be open to having us do that with you guys so we can see what it's like to to be in the industry. So thank you. Thank you. And Councilmember Durango. Thank you, Vice Mayor. You know, one of the things that the Councilmember Pearce brought up was a measure in and I remember that discussion and how divisive it was back in the day about raising the minimum wage of hotel workers to put 1250 or something like that. And it was you know, it was very tough and we had to go to the ballot and it won. And one of the reasons why I think that a lot of. Workers living in Long Beach just because of that. So I remember basically saying that, you know, the raising the minimum wage is not going to be, you know, the sky is falling. In fact, they probably help our industry because happy worker is it makes for a happy visitor because everybody is just working together to make things better for for the tourism industry. I don't have hotels in the seventh District, but I'm sure that they do have a lot of people who live in the seventh District. And I'm sure that having that that salary helps them stay there. And I'm hoping that the hotels, as we move forward, that there would be more opportunities for the management to talk to their employees and help them help them get to that place where they would be able to have a living wage so that they can have their families and send their kids to school here in Long Beach, because we have a great educational system, as we know, with the college promise and all the other great institutions that we have in Long Beach. So it's a wonderful place to be. And that's because of our salaries, because they're competitive and the sky did not fall. In fact, if these statistics that I saw today are any indication, we're getting better and we're and we're growing. And I accredit that a lot also to the to our CVB for going out there and hustling conventions to come to Long Beach and and people who come to LA, which has a great experience to stay in our hotels and enjoying our restaurants and, and being able to have that great experience that we all want everybody to have who visits Long Beach. And I think it's part of part of that. And so if we continue to make our employees happy, everybody gets happy and everybody can can live a full Cleo cliche and a wonderful life in Long Beach. So I want to thank you, Superar Councilmember, for bringing this forward. It's a discussion that we need to have, a discussion we're going to have again as we move forward. I think it's a is still some consideration. I have I have I've had some a I have two, two members of my family who work in the hotel industry. And so I'm somewhat aware of what takes place. And one of the big issues right now is the homeless impact in the hotels and some of the safety issues that that come with that. So I'm hoping that perhaps we can get together and develop a plan or a strategy to address that. I know it is. It's citywide, it's regional, there's regional wide as well as how we handle our homeless situation. But when they start affecting our tourism and they start affecting our hotels, that means that we better start getting together and address it in a way that is going to make a significant impact. And being able to minimize the impact of homelessness in in our hotel industry and especially especially in the in the downtown area. So thank you for the chamber coming forward. Hotel Maya. Yeah, doing good food out there for a while. Going there all the time. But thank you for being here. Thank you. That concludes city council comment. And as this presentation was placed on the agenda, we do need to do public comment here. So as any public comment on item number 31, please come forward. Thank you. Just state your name. You have 3 minutes. So good evening, Vice Chair. Long Beach. Council Members My name is Alexandra Wayman. I am a research analyst with Unite Your Local 11, the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, representing over 25,000 members in Southern California and Phenix, Arizona. We agree that, though, that the Long. Beach hotel industry has been thriving with huge successes in 2016, which have carried through to 2017. The Long Beach Business Journal. Reported at the end of last year that 2016 was the best year ever for the tourism and hospitality industry in Long. Beach. It is estimated that the. Hospitality industry generated $300 million in economic impact to the city. As well as $26.6 million. In total for the city's general. Fund. The downtown Long Beach economic profile, which was created by the city of Long Beach, stated that Long Beach hotels are. 14% increase in occupancy rate. From 2010 to 2016, and a 12% increase in total from 2016 to 2017. The Long Beach Business Journal reported. In June of this year. That the occupancy. Rate of downtown Long Beach hotels was 88.7%. According to a study done by CBRE Hotels. That's 7% higher than the national average. It's reported. That 6.8 million people attended attractions. Fairs and festivals and. Large conventions were booked in 2016 and 2017. It is the work of people like our. Members at local level and the people that work in the hotels that make this industry very successful. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Natalya Soto. I have worked in the hospitality industry here in Long Beach for about four years now at the same hotel. And yes, it's true. As I started working there, I remember starting as a buster and they had to close a restaurant for dinner where I worked because a business wasn't good. And slowly but surely, we started gaining momentum again. And it's it's thriving. So much so that in the last this last summer, I have voluntarily worked about 12 to 14 hour days because it's available to me. Right. But the policy that we have been talked about and it's being talked about here, it's not just about I'm trying to gather my thoughts because so much was said that I just feel I'm angry. We talked about the voice of the worker. We talked, you know, super. Now, thank you for mentioning that. We came last week to speak, but we were not given a floor to speak until public comment. And we are the people that make this industry run. I am happy every day to get up. It's something I love to do. I went to school for culinary arts and business management and it's what I love. I love to serve the guys. I love the Long Beach tourism industry. I resign in Long Beach. I live in Long Beach as well as my coworkers. And it's true. The money that I make in the hotel that I work is a money that I spend in the city that I live. It's the money that I spend to pay for my mortgage and the taxes in the home that I own in the ninth District. Hotels have been so successful. Like I said, that it has increased my workload. We work harder to make sure that tourism industry continues to thrive. People come back and they are like Nevada. It's nice to see you. I recognize guests now that come year after year and they're happy to see our faces. Our policy is about protecting our workers, not about anything else. It's about protecting us. We're not asking for anything crazy. We're not asking for, you know, a raise is like measure. And we're not asking for something that's intangible. We're asking for protection over sexual abuse and overbearing workloads. We're not asking for anything crazy. And the pushback to me is outstanding. I don't understand it in this industry and in this day and age in 2017, why is there pushback? And we have to think about it when the numbers show that measure. And there was a pushback. And now two years later, clearly because of measure and and policies like that, we are thriving here in Long Beach and we're doing better. You know, I feel like people fear change. But this is not something to fear. This is something that we need to move forward on. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi. Yes, I'm Amy BARTOLONE. Born and raised native here in Long Beach. I'm in District seven in the west side of Long Beach. I have worked at the Hyatt Regency, Long Beach for ten years. I have birth this child through health insurance, through Kaiser for ten years. Within those ten years, 911 happened. We all know the business, the hotel industry. It plummeted. No one was checking and no one was traveling. Everyone was in fear of traveling. And I saw it firsthand at the front desk. And now, as the renovation of the beautification in downtown Long Beach here. How everything is so beautiful. Convention center is booming, Hyatt's booming. The other hotels, Hotel Maya is booming. This is Zora, by the way. The hotel has been booming. The industry has has definitely increased. However, with that increase meant I have worked six days ever. Since, like probably couple a month or two now since it's been so busy. It's an immense amount of population and we're. So short staffed. And I don't. Understand how this is happening, how they're bringing in all of these businesses. But like the workers, we're cleaning more rooms than ever. For the housekeepers, the front desk is short. Staffed, even other outlets are suffering. And so this government that we're the suffrage that we're going through, we feel it. I feel it. I love my city. I go to school. Here, born and raised here. You guys need to do something in regards to the hotel workers if even if it's bringing a new hotel and promised the hotel workers in itself to please keep them. Firsthand, because I'm a I'm born and raised in Long Beach and it's. Just crazy how people. Just forget about the hotel workers and sometimes forget about just working hard. And so living. So thank you. I just wanted to say that. Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mr. Vice Mayor. Members of the City Council, Craig coaching with the downtown Long Beach Alliance. I want to thank the Hospitality Alliance for bringing today's presentation to your attention and certainly to ours as well. When it was first seeing it, when it was first formed about a year and a half ago, we had early discussions on how we could play a role and certainly the downtown Long Beach Associates as a business improvement district for downtown I have that has been working with that hospitality industry, the restaurateurs as well as the hoteliers for many, many years and since the hospitality alliance has come to fruition and really taken a leadership role in identifying the issues that it's facing. We've had these ongoing discussions relative to safety and security. Our downtown guides work very closely with the Downtown Security Alliance. A security alliance was developed for purposes of working with different security companies and for security measures with the private, private sector. That's the hoteliers. That is the restaurant tourists. That's the class-A Class B and Class C buildings downtown that do have their own security teams. So we interface with them. We we exchange information with them. We meet with them on a regular basis, and that is in concert with the police department. So this is an organization that we have taken steps outside of our normal public realm responsibilities and really stepped into the private sector opportunities to talk with them, to talk about these issues that they're facing on an individual basis and really looking at common denominators across the board. So whatever issues that are facing there are faced with these with these establishments, we want to be able to address them on an ongoing basis. And it's something that we have taken very much pride in and certainly taken policy at work rather rather than just ignoring them. So again, the business improvement district is at the forefront. It is working with these private sectors as well as the the companies that they're working with to bring a safer and certainly more advanced downtown to our entire community. Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Hamid Raza. I'm at the Long Beach Marriott. I'm not a good speaker, so. Excuse me. Just wanted to address the concern. Just the. The lady is for the kid that she's working for the Long Beach Hyatt. And, you know, we love accolades. We love all the employees as as a hotel. I'm the CFO at the Long Beach Marriott. So health is a union hotel. They do not follow them. By the way, Councilman Tonga, the minimum wage is about $11 and something since they let one in $14.25 US nonunion hotels, we are 100% full measure and we are increasing the wages 2% every year. Right now it's I think 1428 but union veteran not trying that they're paying the payments. The waiters, they're making $11 an hour. You know, how come my question to you guys are, how come unions are not following the minimum wage? You are saying that, you know, are everybody, all the employees are benefiting from measuring? That's incorrect. The people who are working for the Union Hotels, they're not making 14, 28 an hour. They are making $11. And sometimes I would say less than that, you know, so the anybody any hotels, a union hotel, that's why she has a safety concern, because they might not have attended all those safety trainings we offered because they don't care. They are Union Hotel. They are exempt. They can do whatever they want. They can make them 14 hours a day. That poor lady was working. Get here 14 hours a day. None of my employees work more than 8 hours if they want to. If they choose to work, they can work maybe an extra hour, you know. But, you know, if you're a union, how come you give them a clear check? Go ahead. You can make them in three rooms, you know, is that what we are looking for? Is that for the benefit of the people or is it hurt for some specific group are offering your services too. So so I just wanted to answer that that she is the Hyatt is a union hotel. That's why they can do whatever they want because any ordinance you guys pass, there is an exception in there that union hotels are exempt from merger and or any measure you pass. So please go back to where everybody is equal. All the employees we take care of every one of them. I take care of them for their safety, for their security. You know, the minute somebody complained, this person told me this, we expel that guest from our hotel. Thank you. Thank you. And that concludes public comment. Thank you, everyone, for for attending. And I do want to clarify a measure in was passed by voters not a city council ordinance just let's clear the voters Long Beach adopted measure in so so at this point members okay we have one more person Councilwoman Mongeau. Since you mentioned that measure was passed by the voters, would it be a possibility up to this board to ask all hotels. To pay the same rate? I know that the measure and give an exemption, but I mean, I hope that when the. Groups come back to this body over the next several weeks that those. Hotels can choose to pay more and they. Can negotiate with their their labor groups to offer them that opportunity, because that that seems just unfair, that they're not getting that, especially if the discrepancies are no. Longer there. When I saw the board, it says that they're getting medical and and days off and sick days and all of that with the new state law. So I'd be interested in more information on that at a future date. Councilman Pearce. I don't want to carry this on too long, but I do want to answer the question in two ways. One, for any changes to be made to measure, I would have to go back to the voters to when it says union exemption, it's given to that hotel for those workers to make a decision if they want to unionize or not. And then there's a process of negotiation where they negotiate their wage and their benefits, just like we do at the city. I think if we continue to have these conversations, it would be really beneficial to not just kind of put numbers out. There and make assessments, because I've talked to. Many Hyatt workers that make 15 an hour and above. So if we do this, we just need to have these conversations in real numbers and have reports on what. And I don't think that wages are actually anything that anybody's talking about, but I just want to make sure that it's rooted in fact and not some assumptions. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I'd be happy to sit down and learn more about that, because I think that what they were being talked about was the minimum. And I know the. At every location in any employer, there's people. At the bottom and there's all the strata of all the way up to the top. Similarly to Jennifer climbing her way to the top. So learning about that. Think you. Thank you, members. Please cast your vote. Yes. This has received far. Motion carries. Thank you. So we will move on from the less controversial item of the night. So next, we will move on to our consent calendar. And that is except item number 13. We're going to hold that back so that we can we can discuss that item so we can pull up the consent calendar.",Recommendation to receive and file a report from hospitality industry representatives on recently released infographic related to their contributions to the Long Beach economy.,"Here is a concise summary of the vital elements from the presentation:

Adam, 25, is a communications from councilmen, a chair of the Government Personnel and Election Oversight Committee. Recommendation to approve the naming of the newly renovated North Health Facility, the Ron R Arias Health Equity Center. Okay. I'm happy to make this make this motion. Here we have a video to prepare. But I want to start by thanking Chair Hoover now for taking up this item. We're excited about this facility and and particularly the dedication, the approval of the dedication of this name, Ronald Arias Health Equity Center on our tech services. The pull up of video. Hi. I'm one of these Vice Mayor Rex Richardson and welcome to go Long Beach. In recent years, the city has made investments into advancing community health and equity for the residents of our city. And we're excited to announce the city's first health equity center at Horton Park in North Long Beach. And we are particularly honored to propose the naming of this facility in honor of the father of our modern health department, Ron Arias. Let's hear from community stakeholders on why this facility is so vital for our community. Well, the importance of health equity is basically trying to assure that the entire community has a standard of health. The problem that we've encountered over the over the years is that many parts of our community have been left out. Traditionally, we've had neighborhoods that have been severely impacted by environmental factors, and the families that live in those areas suffer more. And so there needs to be more advocacy and more resources in those areas to fight those inequities of having a healthy environment. If the community is healthy, that can be a healthy workforce or a healthy student base. Then that leads to people who are alert. People are hungry to learn and people who are motivated to do better for themselves. And I think health equity is the essence of that type of success. So this new Center for Health Equity really gives us that opportunity to start to create the services needed, the connections, all of us to be able to to build more health equity within our city. We have a center for families and youth in North Miami, and in that space is really focused on family preservation and working to strengthen families and then also some work with the school district. We're expanding those opportunities now, really focusing continue to strengthen families, but also building our new Office of Youth Development. For people to be well, healthy and well, they have to have strong mentors, strong opportunities for education. So that will be there as well as our violence prevention efforts. The workforce development will be co-located at the site to provide workforce opportunities for people reentering out of incarcerated settings as well as for as for youth. So we really we've launched a number of other different programs and all of those will be offered there as well . This is important to North Long Beach because it allows access more freely to people who live in that area. They don't have to worry about barriers such as transportation. They are in a familiar neighborhood where they feel comfortable maybe going back and forth for many reasons, and they can build relationships with the staff there. So there's so many opportunities for community based organizations, community members to meet and gauge plan and really do their work for the for north on. Public health looks at all of this and begins to try and put pieces into place that. Will improve the outcomes and give particularly children the opportunity to grow up healthy and to succeed. So Ryan strongly believes that regardless of where you live in the city of Long Beach, you should have equal access to health resources to be able to have that resource there and be named after Ron Arias. I think that really speaks really loud about how committed we are to having a community center named after someone that is community and that represents community and trust. And I think those are key factors. The trust factor starts with the name on the building, but it ends with the compassion and empathy of the staff within. And given that the health department, which I'm sure they will staff that building with people who care, staff that building who carry on the legacy of someone like Ron Arias, who believes in the people that they serve and believe that they deserve a better quality of life. That is an example of the trust that the name begins with and the service ends with. And as a result, we have a healthier community. We've been building off his legacy for the last eight years in that work and really naming equity as a key space. And so we're just really proud to be able to do that. As difficult as it has been sometimes. He really pushed and advocated for community health. So I'm really proud that he's being recognized for his work and for his dedication and his passion. The naming of the building after me is a very humbling experience, to be very honest with you. I mean, I always felt that I was just doing my job and I tried to do the best job that I possibly could. But it also reflects on the staff team that we had at the Long Beach Health Department, which was an incredible team that was committed to trying to make positive changes in the community that we work in. So you've heard from our stakeholders. This new facility will have health care services for our community, a workforce center, reentry services. These are all things that our communities need to thrive. And you see why Ron Artest is the perfect namesake for our new proposed Ron Arias health equity center. Among these, vice mayor Rex Richardson. And thanks for watching. Go on these. All right. So thanks to L.B. TV and all the guests in that video, I think they summed it up. We're excited to open this the center in the next month. Our construction is complete and Ron is excited for this facility. I think the name reflects the intention of the programs and services within. And so that said, I'm happy to make this motion seconded by Councilman Austin. Thank you, and I'm happy to second this motion. Ron is a great individual who served this city for many, many years, as you heard in the video. He exemplifies health equity and legacy in the city of Long Beach. And so it just happens to be a district resident who is somebody who I think we all lean on for advice and good counsel. His wisdom here in the city of Long Beach for many years. I know I have. And I'm happy to second this motion as important as this the final in fact that councilmember to. I want to thank my fellow council members for bringing that forward. Abdul Rahman, since. Well, let me just say, I've known for a long time. Over 40 years. Admiral Ryan has seen him develop over the years that he's seen me and I've had the honor of working with Ryan when he was director of the Health and Human Services Department. I was his administrative officer for six years, so I had a lot of good close communication with him. His wife, Phyllis, was my tutor when I was at Cal State Long Beach. That's how far back we go. So I'm honored to know Ron and very enthusiastically support the naming of this facility in his honor. Thank you. Thank you. Calcium is in there. Thank you, Vice Mayor, and congratulations on the senator. And congratulations on picking such a wonderful person to me, even after I know when I first got introduced not only to the Health Department, but when I was working finance and Saint Mary's Medical Center. He was someone that I really admired very much because of his commitment to the community and to health. Back then it was over 20 years ago, but I feel the same way today and I'm so very happy to be able to support this item. Thank you. Fantastic. Thank you. Welcome. Congratulations in advance to Ron. We we've not we've all known you a long time and we think this is a very appropriate fitting dedication. And we look forward to the ceremony in about a month. That said, there's no public comment. Members, please cast your vote.","Recommendation to approve the naming of the newly renovated North Health Facility, “The Ronald R.

Our third public hearing tonight is for Council Bill 471. And I want to remind my colleagues at the conclusion of this public hearing will be the opportunity to vote on Council Bill 470, the kind companion bill. So please do not bolt out after this last public hearing. So, Councilwoman, can we please put Council Bill for 71 on the floor? Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 471 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. In has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill for 71 is now open. May we have staff report? Good evening, Mr. President. Members of council again. My name is Tracy Huggins. I'm the executive director of the Denver Urban Renewal Authority. I know it has been a long day, starting with the mayor state of the city in a long night. I would ask that you hang in there with us for another 15 minutes or so while we bring forward a proposed amendment to the Walton Corridor, Urban Redevelopment Plan. And that is why we are here this evening to request your consideration of the amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to add the 2300 Welton Street Project as an approved project and create the 2300 Welton Street property tax increment area. The Walton Carter Urban Redevelopment Area was established in 2012 to encourage redevelopment along the Walton corridor. The urban redevelopment area is comprised of approximately 29 blocks, generally and approximately bounded by Broadway Street on the West Glenarm Place and 24th Avenue on the South Downing Street on the east and on the north by either California street or the alley alley between Walton and California streets. At the time the Urban Redevelopment Plan was approved, no projects were identified. However, the plan allowed for future projects to request tax increment assistance and contemplated tax increment areas that would be approved as projects were brought forward within the urban redevelopment area. The project, being considered through an amendment to the Urban Redevelopment Plan is the redevelopment of the site located at 2300 Welton Street. The project site, which is primarily vacant, is bounded by Welton Street, Park Avenue, 24th Avenue and Glenarm Place. The project is comprised of two separate buildings. The larger of the two structures will span the entire block facing Welton Street between Park Avenue and 24th Avenue and contains 195 units. The smaller building will be situated on the corner of Glenarm Place and Park Avenue and contains 28 units. Project amenities will include a central courtyard fitness center, 24 hour secure keycard access, laundry facilities on each floor, bike storage and maintenance, space residents storage and a pet wash area. In total, the two buildings will yield 223 units, with an overall square footage of just over 268,000 square feet. The project will have 11 units designated for residents qualifying at 30% of the area, median income or AMI. With the remaining 212 units restricted to residents qualifying at 60% of AMI. The Urban Redevelopment Plan authorizes Derry to finance projects within the urban redevelopment area by the use of tax increment financing. The Urban Redevelopment Plan Amendment will add the 2300 Street Welton Street property tax increment area drew. A staff has reviewed the budgets and proforma submitted by the developer and believes there is a financing gap in the project of $769,000. This financing gap will be addressed to property tax increment generated by the redevelopment of the property. The site is currently owned by the developer who is paying approximately $69,000 per year in property taxes. This amount will constitute the base taxes from which property tax increment will be calculated. The estimated taxable value following redevelopment is anticipated to generate approximately $70,000 per year in net property tax increment. These incremental property tax revenues will be used to reimburse the developer for eligible expenses of the $769,000 over a period not to exceed 25 years. The Plan 2000 contains numerous objectives and policies relevant to the redevelopment of the Urban Redevelopment Area, which is designated as an area of change in Blueprint Denver, including conservation of land by promoting infill development within Denver at sites where services and infrastructure are already in place by designing mixed use communities and resident i. I'm sorry. By designing mixed use communities and reducing sprawl. And by creating more density at transit nodes. Encourage development of housing that meets the increasing diverse needs of Denver's present and future residents. Encourage quality infill development that is consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood, that offers, offers opportunities for increased density and more amenities. And that broadens the variety of compatible uses. Encourage mixed use trends aurion development that makes effective use of existing transportation infrastructure supports transit transit stations increases transit patronage, reduces the impact on the environment, and encourage encourages vibrant urban centers and neighborhoods. Identify areas in which increased density and new uses are desirable and can be accommodated. Focus incentives and design controls on private development, fronting major new, existing and historic roadway corridors. Continue to support mixed income housing development that includes affordable rental and for purchase housing for lower income, entry level and service employees, especially in downtown and along transit lines. Identify and capitalize on opportunities to develop housing along transit lines. Support a variety of housing opportunities for Denver's current and future workforce. And use public private partnerships to facilitate development and redevelopment projects that advance the city's goals and objectives. In particular, when appropriate, take advantage of the Urban Renewal Authority's powers and experience. In addition, the proposed project meets the following objectives of the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan, which has as its primary goal, quote, quite simply, to catalyze development, end quote. Those goals include high intensity development near downtown transit stations and along key streets, promote economic and housing diversity, and promote housing density, including structured parking. The general objectives of this urban redevelopment plan are to reduce or eliminate blighted conditions and to stimulate the continued growth and development of the urban redevelopment area. The proposed project meets the following objectives of the Weldon Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan to eliminate the present and growing factors which contribute to the blight in the redevelopment area. Such blighting factors are detrimental to the community and represent an economic liability to the city. To renew and improve the character and environment of the urban redevelopment area and its surroundings by preventing or ameliorating economic, physical and environmental deterioration. Encourage residential retail and commercial development and redevelopment that is socially and economically inclusive and from which the urban redevelopment area and its environs can draw economic strength to more effectively use underdeveloped land within the urban redevelopment area. Encourage land use patterns within the urban redevelopment area and its environs, which will reduce dependance upon private automobiles for transportation. To encourage land use patterns within the urban redevelopment area and its environs, where pedestrians are safe and welcome to encourage the participation of existing property owners within the urban redevelopment area in the redevelopment of their property. Encourage high and moderate density density development where appropriate, including structured parking, and to promote a diverse mix of dense housing options. There are a number of other findings that are required by the Colorado Urban Renewal Law. Of the 2300 Welton Street Project is located within the 2300 BLOCK Welton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Area, and will promote the objectives set forth in the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan. A feasible method exists for relocation of displaced individuals and families and business concerns. The project area contains no residences. Therefore, no individuals or families will be displaced. Additionally, due to the vacancy of this site, no business concerns will be displaced by the project. Written notice of this public hearing has been provided to all property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the resolution setting this public hearing. City Council requested thorough to undertake this task. Written notice was mailed first class mail to all known property owners, residents and owners of business concerns in the Welton Corridor, Urban Redevelopment Area on June 12th, 2013, which is at least 30 days prior to this public hearing. The statute requires that no more than 120 days have passed since the first public hearing before City Council on the Plan Amendment. Tonight is the first public hearing before Council on this Urban Redevelopment Plan Amendment. The statute also requires that two years must elapse before council can consider an urban redevelopment plan amendment if they previously failed to approve an urban renewal plan amendment for this project. This is the first consideration by City Council of an Urban Redevelopment Plan amendment for this project. Also, the plan amendment contains no property that was included in a previously submitted urban redevelopment plan amendment that was not approved by the City Council. As such, the requirement to wait at least 24 months since any prior public hearing is inapplicable. Conformance with the Denver Comprehensive Plan. On June 18th, 2014, the Denver Planning Board unanimously found that the proposed amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan conforms to the Denver Comprehensive Plan and applicable supplements. A letter to this effect has been submitted as part of the record of this hearing. Thorough request. The City Council concur with that finding. The Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan, as amended by the proposed amendment, will afford maximum opportunity consistent with the sound needs of Denver as a whole for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the Welton Corridor . Urban Redevelopment Area by Private Enterprise. 2300 Welton LLC, an affiliate of Century Development, is the owner and a private development entity who intends to undertake the redevelopment project. This amendment to the Walton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan contains provisions for property tax increment financing. Accordingly, Denver Public Schools District One has been permitted to participate in an advisory capacity with respect to the inclusion in the plan of the tax allocation provisions authorized by Section 3120 5107419 of the Colorado Urban Renewal Law. Denver Public Schools has provided a letter of support for the Plan, amendment and the use of tax increment financing. A copy of this letter has been submitted as part of the record of this public hearing. Finally, the city and county of Denver can adequately finance and agreements are in place to finance any additional city and county of Denver infrastructure and services required to serve redevelopment within the 2300 Welton Street Urban Redevelopment Area Project area for the period during which the incremental property taxes are paid to the authority. The plan allows for cooperative agreements between the city and borough to address additional infrastructure requirements in city services should they arise. In closing, there is very pleased to work with the city and county of Denver to bring forward this project. The redevelopment of this site and the delivery of 223 affordable housing units near downtown and along an existing transit corridor captures many city wide goals, objectives and strategies that are found in the Denver Comprehensive Plan, Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan and the Wilton Corridor Urban Redevelopment Plan. Projects like this are exactly the type of redevelopment that was intended when this urban redevelopment area was established two years ago. The ability to secure an additional five years of affordability for the 11 units reserved for persons earning not more than 30% of AMR. I am I as part of the tax increment financing commitment is another benefit of this project. We asked for your favorable consideration of this amendment, and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Thank you, Ms.. Huggins. We have seven speakers for this, and I'm going to go ahead and have all call off them names and please come up to the to your seats and we'll go and order. Mr. SNYDER. Ms.. Winchester, Mr. Saca, Mr. Miller's Mr. Trekker, Mr. Schlanger and Ms.. Glassmaker so you can come on up to those that are still here, that are still would like to speak to this front pew and we going to start with Mr. Snyder. Actually, I think. Mr. Snyder. Okay. Then the next person will be Ms.. Winter. No, no. I know. The other, Mr.. President, and City Council members. I just want to say that I'm here available for questions either from city council or from whomever. We've been working on this development for quite some period of time. And quite honestly, without the help of Durham, we wouldn't be able to get this into the endzone. So it's very important for me and for us. So I'll sit down if someone has any questions or someone here would like to ask any. Questions, and we'll do the questions after all the speakers. Mr. SNYDER. Thank you. Ms.. Winchester Yeah. Mr. President, members of the City Council. My name is Tracy Winchester. I'm the executive director of the Five Points Business District. We are located at 2444 Washington Street in the heart of the historic district of Five Points. On behalf of the Five Points Business District Board of Directors, I'm here in support of this development project and also to talk about all of the many hearings and planning meetings that Brant Snyder had last year in coming up to this point in time. We support his efforts to meet with San Rafael, Curtis Park, Enterprise Hill and the Five Points Business District. Neighbors Register Neighborhood Associations. Numerous, numerous meetings were held at our neighborhood last summer, and even as recently, Dora had a community meeting on July 1st. We support his efforts to bring affordable housing to the Five Points Business Corridor. Our recent revitalization strategy cited affordable housing as a necessary component to attract and maintain the population that is eager to live within our urban neighborhood. Residential developments, such as his will bring new consumers, new revenue streams and activities that will support commercial redevelopment. We also are appreciative of the fact that he is working with Mile High United Way because they are about to open up their new building in September of this year. And even last year he met with the president of Mile High United Way to talk about identifying landscape that will look complementary and create this gateway into our historic district. So this has been taking a long time coming, and I'm glad we're here at this point. I also wanted to mention a little bit about the fact that last year some of the concerns that the community had was the fact that it was affordable housing. A lot of our residents feel that we have enough affordable housing in the area because of our shelters, because of our Section eight housing. And really what we did is we took the time to explain exactly what affordable housing means in this particular instance. And what we're talking about is 60% AMI. Well, of course, we had two ends of the spectrum, 60%. AMI was great, but some people thought that was too high. And so it's very nice to know that in this particular project in front of you today, we have at least 5% of the units that are being designated at 30% AMI. So this has really been reflective of what the community has asked for, and I'm very appreciative of that for bringing this to our area. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Sekou. James Jacob Black. Social Action Movement. Self-defense advocate. Poor, working, poor and homeless people. You got to be kidding me. For real? I don't see no financial numbers on the screen. When we asked in our community meeting that we had at five points at the gas station. What were the numbers in terms of how much per month is the studio going to rent? How much per month is a two bedroom going to rent? How much is a three bedroom? I didn't got the numbers real. You don't know what you're going to rent. Come on, yo. And then you tell me about a community outreach. What time did we have the meeting? In the five points. 6:00. During rush hour traffic with the masses of the people can't even get there. Come on, y'all. Talk to me. About what? Outreach in rush hour traffic. And you have one. Five people there at the meeting out of the entire neighborhood. Five. So we go. Now we're talking about living authentically. And stop lying. There was no community meeting at rush hour traffic. Now you kill me online. Tell me. I'm like like there ain't no community meeting here. At 530 doing rush hour traffic. Tell me I'm lying. And it's institutionalized. Hate is okay. Yo! Woo woo! You satisfied the letter of the law? Really? Come on, give me a break with this and then ask the developer, how much money are you putting in to this cash compared to the $43 million you got in loans and this and that from this agency and that agency. And then what happens? The city council, we get all leverage in on this thing. It goes under he turns it into a syndicate and then run it off on taxes for the next 30, 40 years if it don't work. But does he lose his land? Do we get the land if there's don't work? So let's look at the details of this thing, because that's what happens to us. We get caught up in these kind of real estate deals where we're all in and a little bit out and then it goes under and then you have to renegotiate the loan. Otherwise, you look absolutely ridiculous spending the taxpayers money. And then who's going to pay for this? The people who run it, that's the taxpayer. So now he's going to pay interest loans and all the rest of that money that's given to him. The building. Is there. Thank you. Your time is up. Are you kidding me? Thank you for your. Thank you for your comments. David Miller's. Good evening. Y'all are troopers. It's late. My name is David Millis. I live at 426 24th Street in five points. And I appreciate the opportunity. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. President, for letting me speak briefly. I'm going to reduce my points to a very short amount of time in the interest of keeping y'all awake. My concerns with the project really boil down to a couple of things. One is we've talked about a diversity of housing needs, which is which is true. 223 units of affordable units in one place is a lot. As was pointed out, I live about a block from the from the project site. I've got various a variety of low income units all around. We have a lot of submarket housing units in our area. I understand the need, but in this case I would actually suggest a higher diversity of of housing would be useful. I mean, a mix of both market and affordable would be helpful for this quarter. The other thing I really wanted to mention is the size, the size of the project. The structure itself is a five story, a couple of structures, five stories tall, which dwarfs everything else in the area. This particular area, the the what we think of as the historic Welton district, the Wealth Street District, there is nothing higher than three stories. Most of the buildings in our neighborhood are one, two and three stories tall, including the new library that we really like. Right. So the library fits in nicely with the character of the neighborhood itself. This picture building, again, architecturally, it's just too tall. It doesn't really architecture doesn't try to, I don't know, respect or fit in or make any nods to the historical nature of the of the block itself, of the of the neighborhood, the Welton Quarter itself in this case. And I'm going to paraphrase another Mayor. Hickenlooper. Who pointed out, you can't create historic. So once we kind of build all sorts of other stuff around and ruin the characteristic of the neighborhood, it's gone. So I, I understand the need for the to redevelop. And, in fact, I'm excited about the redeveloping the neighborhood. I'm excited about five points being redeveloped. I love my neighborhood. I understand the need for affordable housing. I just asked to be careful before we right here at the entrance to this wonderful historic Welton corridor, for we put something that is maybe architecturally could be a little better, could show a little more honor, a little more respect for the corridor itself. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Miller. Matthew. And I apologize if I may speak this trucker. TR It's written to RC okay, so guys left and he has left. All right. Next we have Schneider, Tim Slinger, who's left as well, and then our last speaker, Ms.. Glass Glassmaker. Again. I'm Sue Glass Maker. I'm here representing Curtis Park Neighbors, a registered neighborhood organization. It's really surprising to hear some of this because we have quite a different view at Curtis Park Neighbors, our some of our neighbors worked on the development of the urban redevelopment area and back three years ago, and we were involved in that. We were updated on that. We knew what was going on and we wanted that to go on because it's about time for well to get developed. It's overdue, way overdue. And that's part of our neighborhood. And so we don't have that. We support it as a neighborhood organization. We supported the creation of this district unanimously. We also were involved. We were invited in to be part of the design process, and we did have a lot of influence and say on this design. Now the design you see here tonight doesn't do what the final was going to look like, doesn't do justice to it. But this is not part of the historic area. It is part of the commercial area, but not the historic area. So it can go up. This is zoning here can go up much higher than the four stories that it's slated to. We were delighted with having four stories. We think that's very acceptable across the street. The neighborhood spearheaded by John Haden and Keith Prior Reed we did got the park across the street, sunny Gotham Park, which was a problem park got it redeveloped and it's doing beautifully right now. And we want to keep it that way until this project is built. And it was designed with we designed with this project in mind to attract the residents over to that park and keep it safe for everybody. Now to the question of affordable housing. It's always a powder keg because we do have a lot of affordable and low income housing in the area. However, it always has. We believe that it has to be balanced off. And you can you need mixed income and a block away from this development is another development in the on the books it's coming to pretty soon and it has 100 market rate units. And right across the street on park are another 30 units going in right now. So this is how you make mixed income. Mixed income neighborhoods. You balance it off. It has to be balanced. And we have no problem with affordable housing here. 3 minutes is all right. So Curtis Park neighbors definitely supports this. Thank you. And thank you to all of you speakers for your patience. We are now moving on to questions from members of the council, and I'm starting with Councilman Brooks. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to bring up Brett Snyder for just a second. And Brant, to the question of the 60%. Am I. Do you do you know the rents for your particular units for the 221, 223 212 60%. And my units in the 11:30 a.m. I. I believe that are because I when I I usually have to carry the list with me because I'm so focused on other items. But I think with our price. He has it right there. Thank you, Mr. Gibson. Switching agencies right there. Thank you, Chris. Okay. For our at 60%, our one bedrooms are 806 are no. Our studios are $806 a month. Our one bedrooms are 921. Our two bedrooms are 1000. 37 are now I'm sorry, our thousand 37 are the three bedrooms. And at 30%, they start at 400, $403 for a studio, $461 for a one bedroom and 518 for a three bedroom. And the deed restriction of the property, it depends also on how many. Heads you have. One is 20 plus years. 20 plus years. But if there is a single, single mom with two kids like. It depends. Right. It rests down. That's correct. Can you. LSD, what you would have to make for some of these units? Well, generally, just broadly speaking, we're around 30 to $35000, if you want. Okay. Yeah. Tracy. Yeah. It's always difficult when you when you hand someone else your. Your own spreadsheet. So. So, Councilman Brooks, if I if I'm understanding your your question correctly, you want to understand what basically 30%. And so for different family sizes. Yeah, so we got the rents. So now that we understand that, so the community can understand that. So the number the individual what they have to make. So a single person to qualify at the 30% AMI can't make more than $16,110 a year. Family size of two is $18,420. Family size of three is $20,730, and a family size of four is $20,010. Comparatively, at the 60% AMI level one, a single person at 60% AMI can earn no more than $32,220. A two person family $36,840. Three people 41,000 for 60 and for people $46,020. Perfect. Thank you. And Brant, let me just ask you one more question. Did you get any letters of support from I know you met with San Rafael, the Hospital Design Forum. Many of those folks were supportive. I'm just wondering if they wrote your letter support. We have one from the Hospital Design Forum and also from Curtis Park neighbors. Okay, great. Four and five points. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Brooks, Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. I do have one question, and it really speaks to the breakdown of the units and how many you have terms of the bedrooms. Is one unit or was each unit is either a one bedroom, two bedroom or three bedroom, correct? That's correct. How many units do you have breaking down? I know, I know. I've asked this question before and I don't have it in front of me, but I'm just I'm just wondering percentage wise or just the raw numbers, how many units do you have that right? Well, we have 22 studios. We have 109 one bedrooms. We have added. Two bedrooms and we have four. Three bedrooms. And if I may ask you, what was the reason? And, you know, my concern here and what the question doesn't seem to be marketed towards families. I mean, it's with that many three bedrooms, you only have three bedrooms compared to 109 plus 22 single families that maybe just two people, maybe three pushing it. So when you compare three to the 109 plus 22 and then you have 82 bedrooms, what was the purpose for creating that many? Either 109 or 22 studio and one bedroom units as opposed to more. Right. So why it so heavy on that on that one bed, one in one bedroom, the studio side? Well, because, quite honestly, the majority of our tenants are single and they're starting out in their working careers working downtown. And they're not in the family formation stage yet. Do we? I mean, so it was geared towards those numbers. Do you have that kind of data? Well, I'm scared. We have at Broadway Plaza, we have 223 units where I currently office. And when we did that, we had a majority. It was more lean towards one bedrooms over the course of a mature maturing on that property. Now we we have a waiting list for two bedrooms. So we expanded the number of two bedrooms that we were going to have. But we also went ahead and decided we would go ahead and have some three bedroom units as well. But we don't typically I right now I don't know the number of children we have in our building, but I very seldom see them because the closer you get to the central business district, quite honestly, the fewer you see because of the infrastructure where you have to go to schools and things like that. And right after I got married, I lived downtown at the Windsor, the Windsor Gardens, and we were there about nine months and we were already thinking about children. And my wife said, no, and we love downtown, but she said, No, I like to have a yard and and trees and things like that. So it's a little bit different lifestyle when you're the closer you get to the downtown area, it's it's challenging. We're still talking about five points and five points. Is a lot of families correct? Yes, I do. And I'm just I'm just wondering why it was geared towards, you know, the pushes for the studio and the one bedroom. And you look at the need in our city. There's a lot of families that do not have. Units to rent. I mean, it's sparse. And when we look at building affordable housing, I mean, I don't know when you sat down to look at that. I miss. I'm just puzzled why when we're using the tax credits and building affordable housing, that we're not taking that into account. And I really wish that when we develop this kind of housing, are we looking at the whole picture and really look at the need to meet that need? It's you know, I think there's discussions of a affordable. I mean, there's plans to build a very similar affordable housing project and the number of three bedrooms and this is in district three off Alameda and Irving and a number of three bedroom units is a dramatic increase from this. It's a stark difference. And the more I you know, I think we have a school in downtown, I think and it's not downtown. It's five points in five points. We have schools of children. We have Mestizo Curtis Park Pool. It's very family friendly is where people move to raise families as well, too. I'm just I'm just wondering what what got those numbers there? Why is it why didn't we meet that need, if that's a definite need? So I appreciate I appreciate your answer. So thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Ortega. I just have a quick question for you, Mr. Snyder, about the number of parking spaces that you're planning to provide for the two structures, or is the parking different for this smaller building than it is for the large building, or is it all being treated as one property, one project? Well, it's all being treated as one one development, and all the parking is underneath the large building. And for 223 units, we have 207 parking spaces. Okay. And I'm trying to remember what bus service is in the area, is there? I can't remember. Are there busses, Tracy, that run along Park Avenue? Seriously. If you had one, can you come up to the microphone, please? I have to admit, Councilwoman Ortega, that I'm not familiar with Park Avenue, the bus line that runs along there. But I know that we do have transfers over at 30th and Downing that you can grab the bus there. But I'm not familiar enough with the bus lines on Park Avenue West. Councilwoman Ortega, I think Councilman Brooks has an answer for you. Yeah. And I think I think David might know the exact bus line, but obviously this is right on the light. Right? Right, right. Light rail line. That goes right to the main kind of bus terminal for all of five points at 30th and Downing. And that's where most a majority of the individuals in neighborhood pick up. But. Okay. Great. Thank you. That was a council meeting. Just like any other questions from members of council. Seen the public hearing for 471 is now closed. We are moving to our comments and we're starting with Councilman Brooks. Thank you, Mr. President. 2012 September. Many of my colleagues may remember you may not remember we were setting up our urban renewal area for Welton, and this was the vision of it, that we would have diverse opportunities for housing, that we'd have some entertainment opportunities, that we would get redevelopment opportunities on. Welton And this project is the first to come through. And so I'm really excited about that. It's a it's been a labor of love. Brant, thank you for for working so hard on this and Tracy for working so hard. There's already has been involved in this. Tracy Winchester from Five Points Business District has been incredible on this. You know, there's a lot of concerns. I mean, I had the questions like, why has development been so tough in five points? And I think as you all are starting to hear some of these public hearings, you're starting to see some of the some of the conflict. There's a there's a portion of the population that feels like we shouldn't have any more affordable housing. As David began to share sentiments. And there's some data that shows that of our rental units in five points, 30% of it is all the restricted and affordable. But what if you look into that a little bit deeper, you understand that some of those deed restricted units and and land is starting to come up in the next 5 to 10 years and it will be market rate units in housing. So we're trying to keep a balance of this gentrified movement that's come into this area at a very, very quick clip. Speed and housing prices that are going up very high in the Curtis Park neighborhood in San Rafael in the Enterprise Hill neighborhood, and saying what does the balance look like for affordability to all? So it's been a tough balance, but we're trying to strike it. Right. I think someone mentioned the next development that you all see at 25th in Walton will be a market rate project, which is a beautiful project, five storeys, but will have all market market rate housing, which at a at a 95% AMI type of level or 90. We'll see when the numbers come in when just ten blocks down the road, all of the rental units are at about 115%. Ami. So I feel like we're we're trying to get it get it right. And it's been a struggle. But I think folks need to know that we're not trying to rush got run roughshod all over the market and and throw this housing anywhere but we're trying to make sure that we were getting the housing where people really need it, too. Councilman Lopez, this point of the the three units, I think it's a good one. I think it's important to to remind folks that, you know, 50 almost 50% of the units are two bedroom. And I'm glad that we got to that place. Obviously, a piece of what Brian's trying to do is serve the market where he currently is. But I think there's there's there's a question about land and space at the Park Hill units that we just approved. We have a number of three bedroom units in District eight, but they had quite a bit more land to work with . And so it's all of these things. And Councilman Lopez, I would assume that you have a little bit more land where you are and the footprint isn't quite as tight as we were working on this project. Brant had the opportunity to go up to eight storeys, but because of cost and because of construction, he could only go up to five. And so there's some there's some things to consider here. But your point is a good one is well taken and it's something that we're definitely looking at. One more thing I want to point out, to Brent's credit and Sue Glass Maker is the design of the building. Anyone knows that if they're doing a development in Curtis Park, they are about to get schooled on landmarking, on design, on architecture, and Brant and Curtis Park and Sue and Joe Noble all really worked on this design and went through many, many iterations and they came out with a beautiful design that I really think is going. To be great on five points. And if you think about 2013, Walton, you look across the street and you see about $200,000 of improvements. And Sunny lost some part the baseball field and also a new playground and workout facility that's over there by Blair Caldwell. And you look across the street and you see one of the premiere nonprofits in In the City. It's really exciting to see that whole block come alive. And all of that was due to OED, Dora and all of these partnerships coming together. So in the next couple of years, you're really going to see a lot of exciting things. And I will also tell counsel and and folks out in the public that this is not the last TIFF application, that there are other folks who have come to the table. And hopefully in the next year, year and a half, you will see a number of of projects within one mile radius of of this project are now on water. I hope that my colleagues will support this long and arduous part process and partnership. It's been a good one. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to thank you for for working in this area to make sure that there is a good stock of affordable housing. The problem in this city is, as it's success, as we grow as a city, as we become more economically viable and stronger and always bring more business to Denver, more people want to come here, more people want to be a part of it, and that's a good thing. And sometimes it can be a force and it can be a negative thing. And I always say that in this context, because there are a lot of people in this city that have always called Denver home and have called this neighborhood our neighborhoods in the West Side and North Denver home that can now no longer be able to afford not even a single one bedroom apartment, let alone a home. And that although some people may say it's good for business, it's a strong market. It's bad at our core. It doesn't take that into account and we had to balance that. And the only way we balance that is in we have a hand in the matter. We have we have already and we have the tools available for us to be able to help balance. I'm a city councilman now, but you go back a good 30 years ago, I'd even say 20 years ago, and I shared a two bedroom duplex in my family of six with three younger sisters and my parents. And that's just about as good as a guy in Barnum. In Westwood, in Valverde of almost every single neighborhood that I represent, excluding Sun Valley. We've never had more than that many bedrooms as far as I can remember. I think at one point I slept in a tent in my grandmother's backyard because it was just too darn expensive and because everybody who wanted a three bedroom place were jumping all over each other for it. The demand was big then. I assume with a lot of folks who have lost their homes in the recession. A lot of families. Whose parents were either out of work or coming back into it, back into the market, or trying to stay in their neighborhoods. That is the case still in, Councilman Brooks, in this area. And in five points. It's it's so diverse. Not just. Demographically speaking ethnicity but also sizes of families. Income gaps. Right in one area, you have very expensive homes. Summary You have projects. Right. So the population is there. All you got to do is go to the pool at Mestizo Curtis Park and you see these wonderful, beautiful kids. I call this neighborhood at home. Same goes in my Alma and Lincoln Park. Same goes in Villa Park or in the North Side. Right. As a city, we have to plan better. And we have to encourage development that has not just one bedroom or studio for our kids that are in college or singles still. You know, they're either poor in coffee or working at a bar late at night or, you know, doing side jobs here or there or doing all three right, trying to put themselves in school. But families families that make part of the create this the soul of Denver. Right. And it's not just about, you know, the creative class downtown. In Highlands for some of these areas in West Colfax. What about those families? Right. I call Denver home. We have to be able to create enough units. Three better, two better and above. For them to be able to call Denver home and keep this truly affordable and truly guided, to take all of those families who are in a Samaritan House and other areas. A lot of families are homeless. A lot of women and children, many children, families who are homeless because they cannot find anything else right in their squeeze out of that market. So I'm advocating for making sure that we do have that stock built. We're encouraging our developers that we're using our dollars that we're delivering away from the schools in the best interest of some of those kids. Right. And so I'm absolutely in support of this because it fills that gap that we need. But I want to really encourage my point. So thank you. I appreciate the time. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Seen no other comments? We will vote on 471 and then remind my council members we will be voting on the companion bill 470 right after that. So 471 Madam Secretary, Roger Brooks.

You know, when you walk in downtown and we are filled with convention, people here are there. They wear badges. You can't say hug a badger because, you know, that's Wisconsin and we're Colorado.

And I also want to acknowledge colleagues that I served with who worked to place the issue on the ballot to expand the lodgers tax and thank the voters for their support in passing that that allowed part of those costs to to be covered.

Adopting the City of Seattle 2015 Annual Action Plan to the 2014 2017 Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development and authorizing its submission to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Re referred to the full Council on April 13th, 2015. This item was heard previously in Council member Clark's committee. It relates to our Consolidated Plan for Housing and Community Development and is our submission to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development in our report on how our block grant funds are going to be used. The first item we'll take up is amendment number one to Council Bill 118361. This adds a small business technical assistance project to the annual action plan. It provides $210,000 in community development block grant funding and then reduces the microenterprise lending project by $210,000, leaving a total of $165,000 that will be utilized for the technical assistance program. And I would move amendment number one. Second. It's moved in. Second, and any questions? Councilmember Harrell. I just want to make a point that I made this morning. I'm supporting the bill. But again, that discussion we had this morning about small businesses and in particular immigrant refugee businesses or minority owned businesses, that part of what we're doing, we are recognizing that there's a need for technical assistance. I continue to believe that lending and access to capital will be a huge charge of ours. So I would want us to look at latter part of this year during the budget process and next year, whether it's access to capital, which seems which should probably drive a lot of our decision making. That continues to be a concern. We hear it over and over. I'm sure there's a need for technical assistance as well, but I think we need to really put a little pressure on the department to to better understand what's happening out there at these small businesses and what, in fact, their needs are. Since we did identify a need, one of the issues was that we didn't get enough money out of the door. Let's find out what's happening there. But certainly I support this legislation. Thank you. Any other comments? All in favor of amendment number one vote. I oppose vote no. Amendment number one is approved. Amendment number two replaces current language regarding additional researchers resources on page 16 of the proposed annual action plan. With more detailed information, it provides more specificity as to the sources and types of leveraged funds that will be available to projects supported by the Consolidated Plan. I move amendment number 2/2, moved in second and any questions or comments all in favor of amendment number two vote i. I oppose vote. Now the amendment is adopted. I now move adoption of Council Bill 118361 as amended. You know, second. Second, any further comments or questions? Please call the role on the passage of the amended bill. Rasmussen All right.

Deputy Director Savage explained the city has received this grant for several years and used these funds to hire a best clinician. But now the best clinicians are funded by the operating budget. And I'd be remiss if I didn't think counselor Savi George for her leadership with respect to the best clinicians and expansion and expanding that human capital within the police department across several parts of the city. She also explained the department was able to work with the damage to continue using these funds through the best program, which resulted in the current proposal to hire this particular recovery coach. And she noted that they may look to revise the grant to actually be able to hire a few more folks. So that is docket 1207. And I will just add at the end, it speaks to the hub and center of responsibility meeting city wide. I want to thank in particular mass housing and Thaddeus and Kayla and some folks out of Chelsea, Jamaica Plain. I had attended some hub meetings, particularly in Jamaica Plain and Chelsea with respect to this community response to public safety and work with our department to actually expand the resources for this. And so through some creative partnerships including with. Various conversations, they were able to secure funding to bring on more hub folks and to expand that model across other neighborhoods, including C11 and V3. So I just want to thank the PPD grants division for their leadership on this. And I also want to lastly talk about Docket 1 to 0 nine, which is also a grant from GMH. This is to fund backfill for officers who are going through the crisis intervention team and going through mental health trainings. And so officers are going through the trainings. They obviously have to cover their responsibilities. This is what this grant does. It would, if it was explained at these trainings, are voluntary, but of course aimed at officers who ride with the best clinicians to have training. Officers obviously are excited to be able to participate. It makes it easier when there's funding to allow that to happen smoothly so that doesn't disrupt the operations of the department. So at this time, I'm seeking as chair of the Committee on Public Safety and Criminal Justice, I recommend passage of these two dockets, dockets 1207 and 1209. Thank you. Thank you. Does anyone else want to speak on these dockets? Great. We're going to take separate votes, starting with Docket 12 zero seven. Councilor Campbell seeks acceptance of the report and passage of Docket 12 zero seven. All those in favor please indicate by saying I only oppose. Nay, the ayes have it. Docket 12 zero seven has been passed, moving on to 12 zero nine. All those in favor please indicate by saying I any opposed say nay the ayes have it and docket 1 to 0 nine has also passed. Madam Clerk, could you please read? Yes, ma'am. Yes. Do you have them? They were just. It was just. Um, Madam Clerk, if you could please read the next docket, which is 1240.","On the message and order, referred on December 1, 2021 Docket #1209, authorizing  the City of Boston to accept and expend the amount of Seventy Two Thousand Six Hundred Dollars ($72,600.00) in the form of a grant for the FY2022 Jail/Arrest Diversion Grant, awarded by the MA Department of Mental Health to be administered by the Boston Police Department.

Thank you to the staff and our speakers and community members who joined us both in-person and virtually. Our last hearing this evening is coming up. Council members say to Barker, Will you please put Council Bill 532 on the floor for final passage? I move that council bill 20 1-53 to be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 532 is open. May we have the staff report? I see we have. Well, Fenton joining us and we will go ahead, Laurin. How so? Go ahead and introduce yourselves and you can bring up the presentation. Great. Thank you. Good evening. My name is Lauren Howe, and I'm the program administrator for the Healthy Food for Denver's Kids Initiative out of the Department of Public Health and Environment. And tonight, I'm going to be talking about our proposed modifications to Ordinance 302. So just to provide some background information on healthy food for Denver's kids. It was created as a result of a citizen led ballot measure that was approved by Denver voters in 2018. It resulted in a small increase in the sales and use tax about a penny on a $10 purchase. That's created a special revenue fund for healthy food access and food based education for Denver's youth. Funds are being distributed through competitive grant making to nonprofits, city agencies and schools in Denver aimed primarily at serving low income and at risk youth. After almost a year of grant making activity completed, the Healthy Food for Denver's Kids Commission and staff have developed some proposed language changes to our ordinance. Currently, we've found the ordinance is both restrictive for organizations and commissioners, so the Commission is recommending the following language to improve our ability to disburse funds in an effective, equitable and wider way across the community. So a summary of these proposed changes include changing under 18 to 18 and under. That is to be more aligned with standard age cutoffs and include high school students of all ages. We are proposing to change a majority of activities to qualifying programmatic activities that would allow organizations in Denver that are feeding youth or providing education as only a small part of their work to be able to apply for our funds. We would like to clarify that distributed grant funds, rather than organizations overall need to principally benefit Denver residents, since it is a taxpayer fund. We would like to clarify that public schools in Denver can apply in addition to DPS as an entity. So that would also include individual schools and charters in the district. We would like to change the requirement that Commissioners be a resident of Denver to live or work in Denver. To recognize there are many folks that are highly invested in our community but may not be able to live here. We can still express a preference for Denver residents through our application materials. And lastly, we propose removing the commissioner minimum age requirement of 21 years in case there qualified and interested youth would like to apply to serve on the Commission. So we expect that these proposed changes, if passed, will allow more organizations across the city to be eligible for our funds impacting nonprofits and schools and neighborhoods across the city because the grant program may become more competitive. We hope to be able to invest in the most impactful projects. We also anticipate greater equity and inclusion and diversity among our members in terms of age and residency. Still, while expressing a preference for Denver residents overall, we hope that these proposed changes will improve the consistency and accessibility for community members, allowing us to better serve Denver's youth. Overall. So staff have given numerous presentations over the last two years about this fund to registered neighborhood organizations, other city boards and commissions, city council groups, Denver Public Schools and the Sustainable Food Policy Council about the fund and the ordinance in these various meetings. We've received feedback that our eligibility requirements are there confusing. Folks often aren't sure if the organizations can apply. And so this year we received 49 responses to our eligibility form, and approximately one in three of those organizations is not currently eligible under the ordinance right now. So I just wanted to share a couple of specific examples of organizations that could become eligible if these proposed changes are passed. So those that provide wraparound service and basic supports like Jewish family service, mental health, like the mental health center of Denver, affordable housing like hope, communities and youth empowerment and leadership like Project Voice. And those are just a few examples of many. We really believe that the programmatic work of these example organizations exemplifies the spirit of the Healthy Food for Kids initiative. And collectively, they're reaching thousands of children in Denver that these funds were meant to serve. So that is the presentation, and we're happy to take questions. Thank you. All right. Thank you. We have two individuals signed up to speak this evening, both of them online. Our first speaker is Jesse Perez. Yesterday evening, members of council, those watching at home, those that are in the chambers. My name is just sit with some comparison. I'm representing for Blackstar, some movement for self defense, positive action for social change as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and Frontline Black knows and I will be the next mayor of Denver in 2023 . I'm in favor of this ordinance change tonight. I supported the citizen based initiative back in 2018, and I still support it to this day and 2021. This is something that is needed for our youth. Are you need to have access to free healthy food, especially in areas where there are food deserts where we do not have access to free and healthy food. So I would ask that members of this Council please pass this ordinance to my and thank you for finally giving me something to be in favor of for tonight. Thank you. Right on. Thank you, Jesse. Our second speaker is Tess Dougherty, and she's online. But it looked like Tess was gone. And I just want to make sure we're calling her name in case. Okay. All right. Looks like Tess has had to leave the meeting. And so that concludes our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill. Five, three, two. CNN. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 532. Counsel Pro Tem Torres. Thank you, Madam President. I just really want to thank the team, especially Lauren and Paige, who have been shepherding all of our conversations through for the committee. It's my honor to serve on this committee and be a part of the incredible funding decisions that are made. And I look forward to the impact that can be made over the next several years. And I can't believe I'm finally seeing you two in person for the first time. But but I do recognize that what you're responding to and I want to make sure folks know and leave. I didn't see you over there is is the very real challenge that was faced brought to light by the pandemic in getting funds out to organizations that were originally not qualified to receive funds under the original language. And this gives an opportunity for organizations that have real reach into communities, but who may not have had food as a priority focus of their organization. But they may have children or youth or child care or families, whole families where the the objective is still met. So I really appreciate all the work that's gone into this, and I look forward to supporting. Thank you, Counsel Pro Tem Torrez and not seeing any other speakers. I will also give my thanks to the staff because this is something that was really exciting when we were able to gather these funds, but we knew that there were gaps. And I just appreciate you doing the outreach and then the follow up to make sure that we could widen the availability to make sure that folks were getting food, especially now, but going forward as well. And so thank you for your work on that as well. And Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill. 532 Black Eye CdeBaca. Flynn. I. Herndon. I. Cashman. I. Can teach. I. Sandoval. Sawyer. I. Torres. I.

Relating to land use and zoning, the committee recommends that the full council pass the bill's amended OC. The awkwardness of me calling on myself to give this report. This is the omnibus land use bill. It's taken up by the Council over a year or two. Package of several small amendments to the land use code. I talked about this earlier during council briefing. We made a couple of small changes this year. One would allow schools to provide shelter space for homeless students enrolled in that school, which is an important change. Strengthened the protection of facades of character structures in the Pipeline Conservation District. It allows for rules to allow access requirements and adds preservation of trees as an exception to that alley access. And we made a couple of amendments. We were moved to changes we felt didn't meet the criteria of minor amendments and asked the Department of Construction and inspections to come back. We reduced the proposed height limits for the elevator and mechanical structures on building rooftops, which was a point of much discussion in committee. And then finally, we made changes to development standards for rowhouses, which was mentioned in public comments to avoid small gaps between structures. So the committee recommended the full passage of the bill as amended, and I hope I can count on your support this afternoon. So with that, I believe are there any comments that folks would like to make above and beyond that? Nope. Okay. So please call the roll on the passage of the bill.
