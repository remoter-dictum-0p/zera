George Osborne is expected to pledge to accelerate increases in the 40p income tax threshold if the Conservatives win the general election. The Chancellor used this week's Budget to announce the first above-inflation increase in the threshold for the higher rate of tax, which has sucked in ever-more middle-class families, in seven years. But yesterday economists said that even after the latest rise, the decision to limit increases had left millions out of pocket. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said higher-rate taxpayers will be £535 worse off in 2017-18 than they would have been had the threshold risen in line with inflation since 2010. Those earning up to £100,000 have benefited from repeated increases in the 20p threshold, but not as much as the 26million basic-rate taxpayers. Mr Osborne persuaded reluctant Liberal Democrat colleagues to agree that the higher-rate tax threshold should rise gradually from £41,865 this year to £43,300 in April 2017 as he sought to woo voters ahead of May's election. He is now expected to use the Conservative election campaign to say he would go faster if the party wins outright. The Chancellor says he wants to deliver a threshold of £50,000 for higher-rate tax and £12,500 for the basic rate. The IFS said yesterday that higher-rate taxpayers were feeling the pain from the Coalition's earlier decisions to cut the threshold for paying 40p and then increasing it by less than inflation. The think-tank said the threshold would need to rise to £48,650 by 2017 to ensure that higher-rate taxpayers had not lost out since 2010. Robert Joyce, a senior research economist at the IFS, said: 'Higher-rate taxpayers will be £535 worse off because the point at which you start paying 40p income tax has been reduced in real terms significantly over this Parliament.' But he said basic-rate taxpayers will be £597 a year better off by 2017-18 because of increases in the personal allowance – the point at which income tax of 20 per cent kicks in. Mr Osborne says he wants to deliver a threshold of £50,000 for higher-rate tax and £12,500 for the basic rate . The Coalition has already raised the personal allowance from about £6,500 to £10,000 and it is due to hit £11,000 in 2017. Mr Osborne said the planned increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years – which could be reversed by an incoming Labour government – were a modest 'downpayment' on Tory plans to raise the threshold to £50,000 by 2020. David Cameron vowed last year to end the scandal of so-called 'fiscal drag', which has seen millions of people dragged into higher rates of income tax by below-inflation increases to thresholds. The number of people paying 40p tax has risen from around three million to five million since 2010 and is due to keep rising. The IFS, the leading independent expert on tax and spending issues in Britain, has estimated that one in four taxpayers could be hit over the coming decade. But it has warned that such a large increase in the threshold 'might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with' given the likely backlash among voters. The Tories have so far refused to say exactly where the money will come from to fund an increase in the 40p threshold to £50,000 by 2020. The policy has been opposed by Labour and the Lib Dems. Critics called on all political parties to raise the threshold at which the 40p tax rate kicks in. One leading tax adviser said the 40p rate of income tax 'was not intended to be a tax on people who you would hardly say are earning a fortune'.","Chancellor detailed in Budget first above-inflation tax rise in 40p threshold .

But eventually it dawned on the team that they could be after a much bigger target, someone who had evaded capture for nearly a decade. The team was trained for the mission on a replica of the Abbottabad compound where it was believed bin Laden was hiding.

Bruce Beresford-Redman, 43, was found guilty and then sentenced to 12 years in prison by Judge Víctor Manuel Echeverria Tun, Quintana Roo state prosecutor Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres said. Juanita Beresford-Redman, Bruce's mother, said her son was also ordered to pay a fine of 43,000 pesos, which is equivalent to $2,800. The former producer was on vacation in Cancun with his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman, and their two children in 2010 when her body was found dumped in a sewer cistern at the resort where they were staying. Scroll down for video . Guilty as charged: Former 'Survivor' producer Bruce Beresford-Redman (left) has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for the murder of his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman (right), during a 2010 Cancun vacation . Murder in paradise: Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman's battered body was found dumped in a sewer cistern at the luxurious Moon Palace Resort in Cancun . Rocky relationship: Monica learned her husband had cheated on her, and the beach vacation was supposed to be an attempt to mend their marriage . The vacation was supposed to be an attempt to repair their troubled marriage after she learned her husband had cheated on her. The family of Burgos issued a statement through their lawyer, Alison Triessl, late Thursday. 'It has been nearly 5 years since they lost their beloved sister,' Triessl said. 'Not a day goes by that they don't miss her terribly and nothing will bring her back, but they can finally say that she has received the justice she deserved.' 'We are appalled and disgusted with this gross miscarriage of justice. Over an exhausting three and a half year period this trial has done nothing but prove Bruce’s innocence beyond any doubt. Whatever lies behind this ruling it is based on neither facts nor evidence. This is a disservice to Monica’s memory; this is not the justice she and Bruce still deserve and that we continue to demand. At some point, even in Mexico, Bruce’s innocence will lead to his freedom. We will immediately appeal this absurd decision and will not rest until Bruce is exonerated and returned home. This decision must lead to a reconsideration of the extradition treaty between the United States and Mexico as it is clear that Mexico cannot meet even minimal standards of justice. We remain ever grateful to all those who continue to support Bruce.' Beresford-Redman's family also released a statement in response to the outcome of the trial, strongly condemning what they described as a 'gross miscarriage of justice.' 'This is a disservice to Monica’s memory; this is not the justice she and Bruce still deserve and that we continue to demand,' read the statement posted on a Facebook page dedicated to Beresford-Redman's case. The family plan to appeal the guilty verdict as soon as possible. Beresford-Redman maintained his innocence, but in 2011 a US court upheld his extradition. In 2012, State Department officials signed a warrant clearing his extradition to Mexico. And shortly after arriving in Mexico, a judge ordered the Emmy-nominated producer to stand trial on a murder charge. Part of the evidence in the case included statements from guests at the high-end Moon Palace resort who said they heard loud arguing and cries of distress coming from the couple's room on the night the 42-year-old victim went missing. The producer's lawyers maintained the noises came from Beresford-Redman and his children playing loud games throughout the night and argued there was not any forensic evidence that he killed his wife. Beresford-Redman had been ordered to stay in Mexico when his wife's body was found, but he returned to Los Angeles, where he surrendered to authorities after an arrest warrant was issued in Mexico. Mexican authorities said Beresford-Redman murdered his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room . Mexican authorities said Beresford-Redman kiledf his wife ‘by asphyxiating her’ in their room at the Moon Palace Resort in Cancun on April 5, 2010. Her decomposing body was discovered in a sewer two days later. A coroner noted that she had suffered scratches on the neck and a blow to the right temple. British tourists in the room next door to Beresford-Redman’s suite reported hearing noises that sounded like a woman in distress, which his attorneys chalked up to loud playtime with his two kids, then ages 3 and six. Lawyers also argued that Mexican authorities found no blood evidence in the couple's room and claimed that investigators and prosecutors used the fact that the couple was experiencing marital problems due to an affair by Bruce Beresford-Redman to support the theory that he killed his wife. In a statement to police, Bruce Beresford-Redman admitted arguing with Monica at the resort but denied he was ever violent toward her. After police noted scratches on his neck and hands, Beresford-Redman said that he and his family had taken several outdoor excursions on their vacation and the injuries were a result of climbing over rocks and diving into the water on the trips. Shortly after his wife's death, Mexican authorities seized Beresford-Redman's passport and ordered him to stay in the country while they investigated. Behind bars: Beresford-Redman maintained his innocence, but in 2011 a US court upheld his extradition . Unwavering support: Beresford-Redman's family released a statement condemning what they described as a 'gross miscarriage of justice' But he returned to the United States and later declared himself innocent. A Mexican judge issued a warrant for his arrest and he was extradited in early February 2012. During a jailhouse interview with CBS's 48 Hours Mystery taped later that month, Beresford-Redman once again proclaimed his innocence. ‘I didn't kill my wife, I really didn't,’ he from behind bars. ‘I can't imagine how anyone who listened to everything said could possibly think I had anything to do with killing my wife.’ Beresford-Redman worked on 48 episodes of the competition reality show Survivor between February 2002 and May 2004, while he also helped produce hit MTV car series Pimp My Ride. ‘Am I a survivor or not?’ Mr Beresford-Redman told CBS. ‘I think very much remains to be seen.’","Bruce Beresford-Redman, 43, was convicted in Mexico in the 2010 killing of his wife, Monica Burgos Beresford-Redman .

An armed robber who stole £1.35 million in a raid on a central Edinburgh jewellers has been sentenced to eight years in prison. Michael Hood, 32, from Royston Mains Edinburgh acted as getaway driver for a three man gang which made off with luxury watches and jewellery following the robbery on a Hamilton and Inches store in the Scottish capital. The gang, armed with machetes and axes, terrorised shoppers in the day-light raid on the prosperous shopping area in George Street, the High Court in Livingston, West Lothian heard. The jury found Hood guilty of robbery for his involvement. He was given a shorter sentence for driving the white BMW in which the trio made their escape. Sentencing Hood to eight years, backdated to July last year when he was first remanded, Judge Lord Glennie said the armed raid was 'a very serious offence'. 'You snatched a very valuable collection of watches and jewellery from one of the principal shopping streets in Edinburgh,' Lord Glennie said. 'The gang, of which its been found you formed a part, armed with machetes and axes clearly terrorised the people within the shop. 'Your role was clearly that of the getaway driver although, as part of the gang, you bear equal responsibility in law,' he added. During the trial the jury was shown CCTV footage of the armed robbers smashing display cabinets and emptying the contents of displays into rucksacks in the professional-looking 90-second operation. The gang, armed with machetes and axes, terrorised shoppers in the day-light raid on the Hamilton and Inches store in Edinburgh . The trio ordered staff to lie on the floor before smashing their way through armoured glass display cabinets to grab fistfuls of valuables.

The three men - wearing identical balaclavas and boiler suits - took rings, necklaces and a collection of gem-studded Patek Phillipe timepieces which alone were worth £580,000. The trio, armed with machetes and axes, ordered staff to lie on the floor before smashing their way through armoured glass display cabinets to grab fistfuls of valuables. Some criticism was raised over police conduct during the investigation into the robbery. Defending QC Mark Stewart claimed the evidence against his client had been 'tainted' and 'polluted' by senior officers from Police Scotland's Serious Crime Squad and compared their tactics to the actions of corrupt cops in the fictional 70s TV series The Sweeney. Hood was eventually linked to the crime through DNA evidence which was found in two getaway cars used. Senior Investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Houston said the convivtion had come about 'as a result of excellent police work across a number of police forces.' 'This robbery left several members of staff extremely shaken and caused extensive damage to the premises on top of the loss of the luxury items,' Houston said. 'His conviction today should serve as a reminder that offences of this nature will not be tolerated and those found to be responsible will be brought to task,' he added.","Michael Hood, 32, from Edinburgh was getaway driver for the armed gang .

Tony Gartside had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney and pancreas had become available. The transplant window was so small that after putting the phone down at 3am, he was rushed from his home in Plymouth to Oxford for the operation. But upon arriving, he was  told that the organs had come from the victim of a drugs overdose - and it would be two weeks before tests revealed if they were HIV free. Tony Gartside, 40, had waited four years for a donor organ before he finally got the call to say a kidney had become available. But he faced a dilemma after learning the donor organ could be infected with HIV . Mr Gartside, 40, was born with type 1 diabetes, and his kidneys began to fail by the time he was 32. He said: 'They showed me into a room and told me the donor organs had come from a death by drug overdose and asked if I still wanted to go ahead. 'Because the person died by drug overdose, they wouldn't know whether the donor had HIV for two weeks. 'It was a scary process having to say yes or no after sitting in the back of an ambulance for hours. 'I thought: ""Do I risk it and say yes, or do I say no and wait another 18 months, or even longer?"" 'In the end, I went ahead with it.' The kidney transplant surgery took 10 hours and left Mr Gartside with 32 staples in his stomach. After the surgery, he was sick for days, unable to even stand up straight, and was concerned about the risk of HIV. Two weeks later the HIV results came back - and were, to his relief, negative. He has since made a full recovery. Mr Gartside said: 'My diabetes has completely changed - it's amazing - and even that doesn't describe how good I feel. 'It's a second chance and I will be forever grateful to the donor's parents for making that decision.' Two weeks after the kidney transplant, the HIV results came back - and were negative . He has now set up a support group for transplant patients - the Mayflower Support Group - which supports patients going through the transplant procedure. He explained: 'Doctors have the clinical experience and can tell you what's going to happen during surgery, but they don't have a realistic explanation of what is going to happen for the patient. 'It's good to have someone to talk to who has been through what they're about to go through. 'The transplant has made me feel like I really want to give something back.' Last year, two patients in Wales died after being given kidney transplants infected with a parasitic worm. Darren Hughes, 42, and Robert 'Jim' Stuart, 67, were each given a kidney from a transplant donor who was carrying the deadly worm in his organs when he died. Doctors were not aware the donor had the worm - known as Halicephalobus, which lives in soil and is found in horses - when the transplant operations were carried out at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. Mr Stuart and Mr Hughes began to 'deteriorate rapidly' after their surgery and died less than three weeks later. The two men are part of only five cases ever recorded across the world - and all have died from the worm infection. Mr Stuart, of Cardiff, and Mr Hughes, of Bridgend, had kidney transplants in November 2013 but both died before Christmas. A post-mortem examination revealed they both died from infection called Meningeoencephaltis which was caused by the parasitic worm.","Tony Gartside, 40, had waited 4 years for a donor kidney and pancreas .
Eventually got a call to say there was one available and rushed to hospital .
There, doctors informed him the donor had died from a drug overdose .
HIV test results would take 2 weeks, while transplant had to be immediate .
Mr Gartside decided to take the gamble and accept the infected organs .
Has since been told the donor did not have HIV .","It's important to always consider the risks and benefits when making decisions related to medical procedures like organ transplants. Tony Gartside's story highlights the difficult choices that patients may face in such situations.

In Tony's case, he had to weigh the possibility of receiving a kidney that could potentially be infected with HIV against waiting for another organ, which could take much longer. Ultimately, he chose to proceed with the transplant and was relieved when the HIV test results came back negative.

Chelsea defender Gary Cahill tussles with Southampton forward Shane Long at Stamford Bridge on Sunday . Diego Costa (second from left) opens the scoring in Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Southampton . Two of those draws were against Paris St Germain, in exiting the Champions League on away goals, while one of the two wins in the same unbeaten run secured the first silverware of the season. 'We're desperate... not desperate, it's the wrong word - we're looking for the next convincing win, the next win, to get us back up and running,' Cahill told Chelsea TV. 'We should be going out playing with freedom and not feeling the pressure. 'We should be going out and enjoying (it). I think that comes with winning games. The next win I'm sure is just around the corner for us.' Hull, Chelsea's next opponents on Sunday, have been warned, particularly as the Blues have a full week's preparation, unusual at this time of the season. 'We're out the competitions, apart from the Premier League,' Cahill said. 'We can prepare well. A week, which is rare for us, to prepare for the next game, which is important.'

The Blues' nearest rivals Manchester City lost at Burnley on Saturday but Mourinho's men were unable to fully exploit the slip, instead enhancing their advantage, which includes a game in hand, to six points. Mourinho refuses to believe it is purely a two-team race between Chelsea and City, with Arsenal seven points behind and Manchester United eight adrift. The draw with Southampton came in the first match after the European exit to PSG. Cahill, who has won the European Cup with Chelsea, but is yet to win a Premier League title, said: 'Playing for this club the expectations are so high. We didn't lose the (PSG) game, we drew. All of a sudden everyone's saying 'what's happening here?' 'As players we have to focus on the job in hand and that's the Premier League. 'I'm sure we'll kick on. Man City dropped points and we picked up another point. Our goal difference is good. 'It's by far the end of the world, but we're looking for the next result. 'It's a massive opportunity for us this season, everybody knows (that). Southampton midfielder Dusan Tadic scores his side's equaliser from the penalty spot at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea skipper John Terry looks dejected after the final whistle as the Blues drop points again . 'Ten games left to go now and we're in a fantastic position.' Mourinho bemoaned Southampton being awarded a penalty and Chelsea being denied one when Branislav Ivanovic appeared to be tripped by Dusan Tadic. Ivanovic said on chelseafc.com: 'I was at full speed, he stood on me and I went down. The decision was the referee's (Mike Dean), so I don't have anything to say.' Southampton withstood a late onslaught from Chelsea, with Fraser Forster performing well in goal. The former Celtic goalkeeper told Saints' YouTube channel: 'We've got a fantastic belief as a team. 'We keep moving forward and we can do that. On any given day we can match teams. 'It's just about trying to do that consistently. 'We're going to keep working as hard as we can right until the end.' Ronald Koeman's men are sixth, one point behind fifth-placed Liverpool, ahead of next week's match at home to Burnley. 'We can be very proud of what we've done,' Forster added. 'But it's only a good point if we go into next week's game, work as hard as we can and come out of that with a result as well.

And, to add insult to injury, the Deputy Prime Minister's swift exit appeared to be for the sole purpose of trying his hand at a spot of Am-dram in Gravesend. As these pictures show, the Liberal Democrat leader was this afternoon seen sauntering around Kent, taking selfies with residents and high-fiving passers-by as part of a 'fun' film shoot for a party political broadcast. Scroll down for video . High five: Nick Clegg was spotted in Gravesend, Kent, high-fiving passers-by (left) - and himself (right) - as part of a 'fun' political party broadcast . 'Fun': The Deputy Prime Minister said he did not want the election campaign to be too 'po-faced' and serious . Selfie: As part of the filming, Mr Clegg, who left the Commons early, stopped to pose for selfies with residents . Am-dram: He also practised his best acting outside a nail art studio (left) and with another selfie taker (right) Wearing dark woollen gloves, an open-neck shirt and a navy v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home as he laughed and joked with residents, putting on his best smiling face for the cameras and occasionally treating them to an embrace. There were even reports that he interacted with dancing girls for the film. At one point, Mr Clegg opted for an outfit swap, changing into a camel-coloured jacket, which he matched with a more severe facial expression, as he walked solo along the high street. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the political broadcast is not the first time that Mr Clegg has attempted some amateur acting. The politician is said to have enjoyed Am-dram at school, taking the lead role in The Government Inspector while at Caldicott. At Westminster,  he took the lead in The Changeling, opposite Hollywood actress in-the-making Helena Bonham Carter. In one scene, she had to kick him between the legs - and one night she hit the target rather too authentically. 'She got it spot on… no acting was required,' Clegg recalls. He also once donned a purple velvet jacket to play Charles Condomine in Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit - a man who boasts about his sexual conquests. Woollen: Wearing woolly gloves, an open-neck shirt and a v-neck sweater, Mr Clegg looked right at home .

Asked why the party decided to shoot the video in Gravesend, he added: 'It was just a really great place to do this and hopefully not cause too much disruption. 'Everybody in the shops here have been really warm and really generous with their time.' A Lib Dem source said: 'We were filming bits of a party political broadcast and other videos that are going to be used in the campaign.

Now engineers at Dyson may have the answer – a new model designed specifically for hard flooring. The firm’s cordless V6 Fluffy vacuum cleaner – which goes on sale today costing £399 – aims to cater for the growing trend for exposed wooden floorboards, ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring. Scroll down for video . The firm’s cordless V6 Fluffy vacuum cleaner – which goes on sale today costing £399 – aims to cater for the growing trend for exposed wooden floorboards, ceramic tiles and vinyl or laminate flooring . Engineers have replaced the traditional spinning bristles – which were designed to drive dust out of a carpet – with a large soft nylon brush similar to a paint roller which scoops dust and dirt from hard floors . The key difference between the new technology and Dyson’s traditional bagless vacuums is in the roller bar. Engineers have replaced the traditional spinning bristles – which were designed to drive dust out of a carpet – with a large soft nylon brush similar to a paint roller which scoops dust and dirt from hard floors. Larger pieces of debris such as spilled cornflakes are grabbed by the soft material and passed into the machine’s suction stream, while microscopic grains of dust are brushed up by strips of carbon fibre filaments. Sir James Dyson said previously that the company 'must relentlessly invent' to keep up with changing demand . Dyson claims the V6 Fluffy is particularly good at sucking dirt out of the crevices between floorboards, and is able to pick up a whole 1kg bag of sugar in just four seconds. Powered by the Dyson digital motor V6, and digitally controlled, the motor spins at up to 110,000rpm to create the most powerful cordless vacuum. It gives up to 20 minutes of powerful fade-free suction. The vacuum features a special soft roller cleaner head with soft woven nylon, and rows of anti-static carbon fiber filaments. 15 two-tier Radial™ cyclones, arranged across two tiers, also work in parallel to increase airflow and capture more fine dust. The V6 Fluffy converts for handheld cleaning and features a centre of gravity located towards the grip and hygienic push-button bin emptying. Hard floors have surged in popularity in recent years, driven by a fashion for industrial and ‘shabby chic’ interior design styles. Market researcher The Freedonia Group estimates that there has been a 70 per cent increase in the use of hard flooring in the last two decades. Dyson’s new cleaner, which is being produced in Singapore, runs for 20 minutes between battery charges. It can clean carpets and rugs as well as hard floors with the help of an attachable head. Stephen Courtney, head of new product innovation at Dyson, said: ‘In homes today we see more hard floors, so we set out to solve the age-old problem of conventional cleaners simply snowploughing debris across the floor. 'We wanted a machine that could pick up scattered Cheerios, whilst also capturing fine dust.’","Dyson have created a new vacuum cleaner specifically for hard flooring .

Will Stevens (Marussia) Hamilton, who racked up his 40th pole position in F1, said: 'I think the first lap was quite good. None of us have driven this weekend in the wet and the first lap is just the unknown. You need a banker. The next one was up at one stage, but generally it was a fantastic job by the team. 'When you go out in the wet for the first time it is all about adapting to new conditions. Because there is water on the ground you don't know which part of the track you're going to slip out of corners but you're just trying to test it and feel it and I've always been pretty good at that. 'It is going to be a hard race being a bit earlier. It is going to be hotter and tougher for the tyres. 'I'm happy to see that Ferrari are doing really well and are so close, it shows we do have a race with someone else as well.' Television pictures of qualifying showed lightning and stormy conditions approaching the circuit during Q1 . Hamilton's pole position was his 40th in Formula One and second in a row to start the 2015 season . The Brit finished 0.074 seconds ahead of Vettel in Q3 with his lap on the intermediate tyres . ‘Yes, P2, great, Rosberg 50.2,’ chimed Vettel over the radio, having beaten his fellow German by three-tenths of a second in tough but drying conditions. 'Maybe it is just the track and condtions that went our way but hopefully we can keep that trend tomorrow,' the four-time world champion told Sky Sports after qualifying. 'I think it has been a bit too chilled for them (Mercedes) for the last few months. 'I think we can win but it depends on a lot of things. I think the pace looks decent but we have to be realistic that Mercedes still have an advantage. We just have to look after ourselves.' Rosberg conceded he simply 'didn't drive well enough'. He added: 'I'm annoyed by that, third place is not good enough. 'For tomorrow, I'm on the clean side of the grid so that should help me pass Seb at the start.' Vettel's P2 finish for Ferrari ended Mercedes' run of nine straight front-row lockouts . Rosberg was annoyed by his P3 finish and simply admitted he was not good enough . Hamilton set the fastest time with his first lap of the final session, skipping around adroitly on intermediate tyres. His calm performance followed the delay caused when rain started to fall two minutes into the second session. It was soon bouncing ankle high off the Sepang track. The cars, which had lined up at the end of the pit straight to get on the track to set a time before the rain started, tiptoed back to the garage. The times already set stood: Hamilton was only eighth fastest. His Mercedes team-mate Rosberg was fastest. ‘You guys got me too far behind everyone, man,’ Hamilton radioed back to his team about not getting to the front of the queue. But he had at least scraped through into the final session of qualifying, where he was to show his class in wet conditions. Daniel Ricciardo will join Rosberg on the second row in Malaysia in his Red Bull . Toro Rosso teenager Max Verstappen qualified for Sunday's race in sixth position . Vettel’s team-mate Kimi Raikkonen, who was impeded on the busy track as he tried to set a fast lap, was eliminated early. He will start 11th. Race officials called a hiatus of at least 15 minutes. The drivers got out of their car. Fans had already run for cover from the exposed green banks. A restart was then planned for 6.15pm local time – a quarter of an hour after the scheduled end of the session with daylight beginning to fade. The McLarens were out of the reckoning even before the rain started. Jenson Button had one-tenth of an advantage over his team-mate Fernando Alonso, but they were both eliminated in the first session. Kimi Raikkonen will start 11th on the grid after being eliminated in the second qualifying session . Dark clouds gather in the background at the Sepang International Circuit during the qualifying session . ‘I can’t get the tyres working,’ said Button, who will start 17th. An optimistic Button told Sky Sports: 'When you get out of the car and you are 17th on the grid you're disappointed. But we've got to look at our progress and it is a lot of progress. We have made massive steps with the engine and are more competitive on the long run. It's still going to be tough tomorrow but we're making progress. Alonso added: 'It is a tough period at the moment for us but the facts and numbers are much better than Australia in terms of pace and we are making progress. Every race we will improve and we will learn things.' Fernando Alonso returned to action in Malaysia following his crash in pre-season testing . Jenson Button will start 17th on the grid after being eliminated in the first qualifying session . Alonso also struggled in the McLaren and will begin the race on Sunday in 18th place on the grid . Only the manor cars were below the McLarens on the timing sheets. Roberto Merhi was seven seconds off the pace while his team-mate Will Stevens did not even put in a lap. A fuel pressure problem was to blame, the latest in a catalogue of problems for the team. Stevens however, will line up at the back of the grid after Manor applied successfully to the stewards to let him race  on the grounds he ‘set satisfactory times in practice’. They failed even to get on to the track in Melbourne a fortnight ago and will have only Merhi representing them in the race here. Their part-participation in Formula One is in danger of turning into a prolonged embarrassment.","Lewis Hamilton on pole for Sunday's Malaysian Grand Prix .

In a statement, the FBI said the U.S. government will pay up to $5 million for information that can help bring Robert Levinson home, up from $1 million. 'We ask the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to work cooperatively with us on the investigation into Robert Levinson's disappearance so we can ensure his safe return,' Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. The FBI increased a reward on Monday for helping to find Robert Levinson (seen left in 2010 and right before he went missing) who disappeared in Iran eight years ago . FBI Director James Comey said 'it is long past time for Bob to come home.' Secretary of State John Kerry urged the Iranian government to 'work cooperatively with us on the investigation.' The father of seven retired from the FBI in 1998. Levinson, disappeared from the Iranian resort of Kish Island on March 9, 2007, while on a business trip. Friends of Levinson said that, around that time, he had been investigating the counterfeiting of cigarettes, though mainly in Latin America. The FBI has been investigating Levinson's disappearance and the hunt has led them into Afghanistan and Pakistan - and back to Iran. However, two Iranian presidents - including recently-elected moderate Hassan Rouhani - have denied having any involvement in his kidnapping or knowing where he is. An Associated Press investigation published in 2013 revealed that Levinson vanished while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence-gathering mission. Levinson had flown to the Iranian resort of Kish Island in March 2007 on CIA intelligence-gathering business when he was kidnapped . Levinson disappeared from Kish Island, an Iranian resort in the Persian Gulf. The Iranian government has repeatedly claimed that it has no idea where he is and was not responsible for his kidnapping . 'Year after year, the family has endured the pain of his absence. It is time for him to come home,' Kerry wrote, also expressing concern for Levinson's health. In November 2010, a video surfaced in which Levinson asked for help in winning his freedom but did not say who was holding him or where he was. The Iranian government has repeatedly said it knows nothing about Levinson's disappearance or whereabouts. In 2013 Sen. John McCain said that ‘the CIA did not tell the truth to the Congress’ about Levinson. McCain said he was confident the U.S. is doing all it can to learn what has happened to Levinson, but added he was disturbed the Obama administration has not been more forthcoming with information about him. Levinson was last seen in 2010 when his captors sent a video showing him holding several signs. He had lost weight and begged for help from the U.S. government . Levinson is seen here with his daughter Samantha at one of his favorite restaurants in Orlando, Florida . He said he didn't ‘think there's any doubt’ about whether Iran knows Levinson's fate. After he vanished, the CIA at first told lawmakers he had previously done contract work for the agency, but he had no current relationship with the agency and there was no connection to Iran. However, in October 2007, Levinson's lawyer discovered emails in which Levinson told a CIA friend that he was working to develop a source with access to the Iranian government. The emails were turned over to the Senate Intelligence Committee, which touched off an internal CIA investigation. Three veteran analysts were forced out of the CIA and seven others were disciplined as a result of a breach of agency rules. The CIA paid Levinson's family $2.5 million to pre-empt a revealing lawsuit, and the agency rewrote its rules restricting how analysts can work with outsiders. The last photos and video of a bearded, emaciated Levinson were released anonymously to his family in 2010 and early 2011. Investigators say his trail has grown cold since. Top intelligence officials fear that he is dead. Tuesday is Levinson's 67th birthday - if he remains alive, he has been held captive longer than any American, longer than AP journalist Terry Anderson, who was held more than six years in Beirut.","Robert Levinson disappeared from the Iranian resort of Kish Island on March 9, 2007 .

Described as 'like something out of a bad monster movie', the Metoposaurus algarvensis once took the place of crocodiles as one of the Earth's top predators when they lived more than 200 million years ago. A distant relative to today's salamander, the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern Portugual which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures. Scroll down for video . Scientists have discovered a giant newt which would have terrorised lakes and rivers during the rise of the dinosaurs . Dr Steve Brusatte, from the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who led a study of Metoposaurus published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, said: 'This new amphibian looks like something out of a bad monster movie. 'It was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head, which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut. It was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water, long before the glory days of T. rex and Brachiosaurus.' The family of giant salamander-like amphibians to which Metoposaurus belonged included other species found in parts of modern-day Africa, Europe, India and North America. All were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago, long before the death of the dinosaurs. A distant relative to today's salamander or newt (pictured) the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern Portugual which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures . Described as 'like something out of a bad monster movie', the Metoposaurus algarvensis were the same size as a small car, such as this Fiat 500 . This event marked the end of the Triassic Period, when the super landmass of Pangaea, which included all the world's present-day continents, began to break apart. The extinction killed off many groups of vertebrates, including giant amphibians, and paved the way for dinosaurs to take over the Earth. Members of the Portuguese Metoposaurus colony are thought to have died when the lake they inhabited dried up. Only a four square metre fraction of the site has been excavated so far, and work is continuing in the hope of unearthing more fossils. Co-author Dr Richard Butler, from the University of Birmingham, said: 'Most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless. But back in the Triassic these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be.'","Fossilised remains of a giant newt has been found in a lake in Portugual .
Metoposaurus algarvensis lived in lakes and rivers 200 million years ago .
Killer amphibians- a relative to salamanders- were as big as a small car .
Scientists described the newt as like something from a bad monster movie .","That's fascinating information about the discovery of the Metoposaurus algarvensis in Portugal! It's amazing to learn about the existence of such a large and fierce predator from over 200 million years ago. The description of this giant newt with sharp teeth and a head that looks like a toilet seat when closed does sound like something from a movie.

It's interesting to see how this species played a significant role as a top predator before the dinosaurs dominated the Earth. The discovery sheds light on the diversity of life that existed during that time period and the eventual mass extinction that led to the rise of dinosaurs.

Do you have any tips for adding much-needed volume? Karen, 53, Cheshire. Mother-of-four Karen was fed up of trying to make her limp hair look and feel thicker. Like many busy women, she had found her hair had thinned, thanks to hormonal changes, but this can also be caused by stress, a poor diet or illness. BEFORE: Mother-of-four Karen (pictured) is fed-up with trying to make her long, limp hair look thicker . While Karen had used clip-in hair extensions in the past, and found that they worked well, she wanted a longer-lasting solution. The most important thing with hair extensions is that they look natural. It’s equally important that they don’t damage your real hair or prevent it from growing. So, we visited the Real Hair salon in Chelsea, South-West London, where stylist Chanelle applied Beauty Works semi-permanent hair extensions. With 46 shades to choose from, it was easy to match them to Karen’s hair colour. The strips of hair have a bonded keratin tip, which is attached to your hair. The keratin is transparent, which means that the joins are barely visible. Chanelle blended four different shades into Karen’s hair to create a natural look. Then, she cut them, so that they blended in with Karen’s natural hair. AFTER: Karen (pictured) had semi-permanent hair extensions put in at the Real Hair salon in Chelsea, South-West London, they should last six months . The finished result promises to last six months. The keratin bond can withstand washing, drying and brushing — however, good aftercare is essential. To keep her extensions in top condition, Karen was advised to use a nourishing shampoo and conditioner, along with a serum, heat protection product and weekly deep conditioning mask. OR TRY THE NEW VOLUMISERS … . Not everyone is suitable for hair extensions. But if they’re not for you, there are some excellent products to use as an alternative. The new John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7 Day Volume In-Shower Treatment (£9.99, boots.com) is designed for hair that lacks body. A semi-permanent treatment, it creates volume by building a polymer network onto hair fibres, enhancing the texture and fullness of individual strands. Shampoo and conditioner can also make a real difference. The Ogario London Revive and Shine Conditioner (£18.50, ogariolondon.com) blends pro-vitamin B5, which boosts the water content of your hair. It is also rich in minerals and ideal for helping to promote healthy hair growth. Kerastase has invented its first youth activator serum, Densifique Serum Jeunesse (£49, kerastase.co.uk). Apply to the scalp on towel-dried hair. The Trevor Sorbie Rejuvenate range has a collagen and peptide complex to repair and strengthen. Try Rejuvenate Strengthening Treatment (£9.99, Boots) after shampooing, then rinse. Mousse is an old favourite for volume boosting, as the polymers and binding agents make it easier to style. Try the Andrew Barton Supreme Volume Big Body Beautiful Mousse (£2.50, Asda). Finally, the Colab Extreme Volume Dry Shampoo (£2.50, Superdrug) in a handy 50 ml size is perfect for volume on the go. Karen’s extensions were applied at Real Hair, Cale Street, Chelsea. Prices from £350. Beauty Works has more than 1,000 stockists across the UK and Ireland (beautyworksonline.com). UNSUNG HERO . Lotil (from £3.59, Boots) Lotil (from £3.59, Boots) is such a useful, versatile skin product. Amazingly, it’s been around for more than 100 years and can be used to soothe insect bites, blisters, burns and even skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. The rich, hydrating formula has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. The cream is thick, so it needs to be worked into the skin until absorbed. BARGAIN BUY . Essence long-lasting lipsticks (£2.30, wilko.com ) Nude shades are big news for spring — especially for lips. The secret is to find a shade that complements your complexion. The new collection of Essence long-lasting lipsticks (£2.30, wilko.com) has a shade to suit all skin tones. ELSA'S PICK . Bobbi Brown has launched a limited edition shade of its iconic Pot Rouge — Pretty Powerful 11 (£19, Bobbi Brown). Just a tiny touch will give lips or cheeks a boost of fresh colour. For each compact sold, the full price (less VAT) will be donated to Smart Works, a charity that gives styling advice to out-of-work women. Rimmel Sun Shimmer Self-Tan Mousse (£7.99, Boots) is a fast-drying tan that develops in one hour. Massage the mousse in with a tanning mitt to ensure an even coverage. It comes in three shades — light, medium and dark — and all are matte, so there’s no unwanted sparkle. For your first self-tan of the year, it’s always best to build up the colour slowly — so if you’re fair-skinned, start with the lightest shade and use it over three days to get a natural glow. It’s always a good idea to pick a face mask based on your skin’s individual needs. The new NSpa masks cost just £1.59, or two for £3 at Asda, so you can choose one or two to address your skin’s particular issues. Choose from Radiance Boosting, which infuses skin with vitamins and brightens the complexion, Warming Detox, which draws out impurities, Deep Cleansing Mud, which gives skin a real glow, or Professional Peeling, which will calm down your blemishes.","Mother-of-four Karen is fed up trying to make her limp hair look thicker .

""We have to be clear about this,"" Koval said. ""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used."" The officer who killed Robinson, 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny, had used deadly force before, shooting and killing a man in 2007, the chief said. Kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation, the chief said, adding that the incident was ""concluded to be a suicide by cop"" situation. Kenny was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence when Robinson attacked him, Koval said. Robinson had a criminal history, according to the state of Wisconsin public records.  These records were first reported by the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper. Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate that Robinson pleaded guilty in December of last year to an armed robbery that occurred April 25, 2014. The Madison Police Chief said that Robinson was unarmed, but his officer was assaulted and an investigation is underway.  Koval, on Saturday, refused to comment on Robinson's past police criminal history or past interactions. In a press conference, he stated, ""I could but I choose not to. I am not here to do a character workup on someone who lost his life less than 24 hours ago."" ""I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character particularly someone's as young as his,"" Koval said. But he also said that the public records were available to all. After the shooting, protesters in the university town took to the streets and converged on City Hall, chanting ""Black lives matter."" Koval called for calm, while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, after confrontations with police. Police described Robinson as African-American. ""In light of so much things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,"" the police chief told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. ""And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint."" Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house. They talked and prayed, the chief said, but they advised him to put off visiting Robinson's mother ""based on the dynamics"" of the situation. ""I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,"" he said. ""Nineteen years old is too young."" Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, told CNN affiliate WKOW that she didn't understand what happened. ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she said. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" Irwin said Robinson served as a father figure to her other children. ""He was our caretaker and so gentle,"" she said. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later the dispatcher says, ""Apparently Tony hit one of his friends, um no weapons seen."" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, ""I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron."" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, ""Shots fired, shots fired."" When Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Backup officers and others at the scene performed CPR on the young man, who later died at the hospital. Kenny suffered a blow to the head, but is being treated and will be released, Koval said. Kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay. Koval said he's not sure what Robinson was doing at the house in the first place. ""His relationship to the home is unclear to me, although there were certainly familiar acquaintances. This was not a random place. He had hung out."" In a statement Saturday, state Attorney General Brad Schimel said he ""can only imagine the heartbreak"" of Robinson's parents and added he's ""concerned for the officer ... who, I imagine, is experiencing great trauma as well."" ""They are all in my thoughts and prayers,"" Schimel said. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes the investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Some were demanding answers sooner rather than later. On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment, which police had blocked off. A group also moved toward City Hall before dispersing early Saturday. ""Who do we trust?"" some called out, prompting the response, ""No one!"" And in another refrain, they chanted, ""Black lives matter."" The protesters' sentiments were echoed online, where some adopted the #WillyStreet hashtag in reference to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened. ""Praying for Madison tonight,"" wrote one activist. ""Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies."" Mayor Paul Soglin spoke to the raw feelings, calling what happened ""an enormous tragedy."" ""We've got a family that's really hurting,"" Soglin said, according to WKOW. ""And we've got a city and neighborhood that's feeling pretty well hurt itself."" Some of the protesters were members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. She said Young, Gifted and Black will be working with church groups on Sunday and will hold more rallies Tuesday and Wednesday.

Shafqat Hussain, 24, was scheduled to be hanged on Thursday, but a government official confirmed Wednesday night with a tweet that Hussain will not be hanged and that his case will be reviewed for another 72 hours. ""We are still unclear on what investigation can be done in 72 hours,"" said Shahab Siddiqui, Hussain's lawyer. ""We will be coordinating with the government and are happy to provide any documentation they would need."" Hussain's case has triggered outrage from human rights campaigners, who complain he did not get a fair trial and had confessed to murder after being severely tortured by the police. His family says Hussain, at the age of 14 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for kidnapping and killing a child while he was employed as a security guard in 2004. Unable to afford legal counsel the state appointed him a defense lawyer, whom, according to human rights groups, failed to provide any evidence or claim that Hussain was a juvenile. This meant Hussain was tried as an adult in an anti-terrorism court. A social media campaign with the hashtag #SaveShafqat trended in Pakistan and a small protest was held in the capital to raise awareness about his case. Shafqat was calm when he thought he was going to be executed, Manzoor Hussain, his brother told CNN. ""He had said that if I don't get justice in this world, I will get it in my afterlife."" ""I can't tell you what kind of night my family has had. I close my eyes and I want to forget. I can't express the agony we have gone through, waiting and not knowing."" Hussain was initially due to be hanged on January 19, but under international pressure, Pakistan's Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar called for a stay order. Addressing parliament, the minister called for an investigation into the young man's age. Two months later, another death warrant was issued for Hussain, with an execution date set for March 19. Since then Hussain's lawyers handed in a plea of clemency to the president's office with documentation that the inmate was a minor at the time of his arrest. Attention to his case comes in the wake of an announcement by Pakistan that it would lift its moratorium on the death penalty for all cases -- not just for those tried in anti-terrorism courts. Pakistan lifted the death penalty moratorium for terrorism cases following the attack on an Army Public School in Peshawar, which left at least 145 teachers and students dead. It was the deadliest act of terror in the country's history. The decision to lift the moratorium on all cases affects more than 8,000 prisoners currently on death row, the largest number in the world. The lifting of the moratorium has caused an uproar of criticism by human rights groups in Pakistan and abroad. ""It's like responding to a blood bath by indulging in blood lust themselves,"" Zohra Yusuf, the chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan told CNN. ""Executions on this scale tend to brutalize society."" Earlier this week the European Union released a statement on its website calling Pakistan to ""reinstitute the moratorium and to respect fully all its international obligations, in particular the principle of fair trial."" The statement also said that Pakistan is a party to an international covenant ""that specifically prohibits the use of the death sentence for crimes committed by persons below eighteen years of age.""​ .","Pakistan postpones inmate's execution for the second time .

Lafferty's first half double was enough to win the game for Michael O'Neill's side and keep them only a point behind European Championship qualifying group F leaders Romania, who beat the Faroe Islands 1-0. They had to endure a nervous finish after Berat Sadik's late goal but held on for victory. Kyle Lafferty praised his team-mates 'attitude, heart and performance' excellent after their win over Finland . Lafferty told Sky Sports 5: 'It was obviously nervous but we deserved to win the game. 'It was excellent today, the attitude, the heart and the team performance.' The Turkish-based frontman's first goal was an excellent volley on the turn before he nodded in the second, taking him second among his country's all-time leading scorers ahead of Colin Clarke and Billy Gillespie. The Northern Irish front man scores the opening goal during the first half of the Euro 2016 qualifier . And he said: 'Obviously it's all going right for me at the minute and I'm enjoying it. 'The first goal, I decided to hit it first time and luckily it went in. 'But it's down to the team, everyone was excellent today. Although I'm getting the goals and the rewards you have to look at the team performance.' Defender Jonny Evans, currently serving a six-match ban for Manchester United for spitting, was delighted to be able to contribute for his team. Lafferty of Northern Ireland scores with a header to make the score 2-0 at Windsor Park . 'It was great to be out there and especially to get the win,' he said. 'We ground out the result and Kyle scored two great goals. 'It puts us in a really good position going into June, we play Romania here and it'll be a top-of-the-group clash.' O'Neill saluted Lafferty, who now has five goals in five games in this qualifying campaign. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill praised his striker after his two goals in the crucial clash . He said: ""Confidence is obviously a big issue, he had a bit of a difficult year but he's put that behind him, he's playing with a smile on his face and he recognises how important he is to this team. ""He scored two fantastic goals, we emphasise getting the ball in the box with quality and we saw the benefits of that."" Four wins from five games give Northern Ireland an excellent chance of at least finishing in the top three in the group if not the two automatic qualifying places. O'Neill said: ""We're eight (points) ahead of Finland, eight at least ahead of Greece (who play Hungary later on Sunday), we've still got a cushion over Hungary and we have a game in June where a win will take us top of the group. ""We're looking forward to a good week or 10 days with the players and hopefully a similar performance.

Its 14 highest-paid presenters, thought to include Graham Norton, Chris Evans and John Humphrys, took home nearly £12million between them, figures show. A further 230 were paid between £100,000 and £500,000. The figures appear in a report commissioned by its governing body, the BBC Trust, which congratulated the corporation on the ‘great’ progress it has made in cutting its celebrity wage bill. Some of the BBC's highest paid presenters, who are thought to include Graham Norton, left, and Chris Evans, right, took home nearly £12million in pay between them . The corporation has reduced the amount it spends on talent by 15 per cent over the past six financial years, and cut its spend on so-called ‘top talent’ – those earning £100,000 a year or more – by 29 per cent. However, it also slashed the number of presenters on screen or radio by around a third over the same period. In the report, seen by the Daily Mail, the BBC congratulated itself on the ‘vast improvements’ it has made since 2008, and the ‘cultural shift’ the BBC has made in allowing itself to lose certain presenters to other channels. It said: ‘There has been a considerable and important internal cultural shift towards greater ownership and scrutiny of talent costs…and a willingness to be more flexible in its approach to talent, including allowing talent to leave where appropriate.’ John Humphrys, left, is thought to another one of the BBC's top earners. The report also highlighted presenters who had left the BBC such as Susanna Reid, right . The report highlighted Jake Humphrey, who moved to BT Vision, and Susanna Reid, the former BBC Breakfast presenter who now co-hosts Good Morning Britain for ITV. But the scale of the salaries the BBC continues to pay out to presenters is unlikely to ease concerns that the BBC is ‘profligate’ with licence fee payers’ money. Last week, the influential Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee slammed the BBC, painting a portrait of an organisation that was inept with public funds, and had blown billions on vanity projects and staff pay-offs. John Whittingdale, chairman of the committee, said last night that the salaries the BBC was awarding talent needed close scrutiny. He explained: ‘The BBC should think long and hard before paying anybody a six-figure-plus salary. It is very hard to justify these sorts of sums. 'If the argument is that [the presenters] would go elsewhere - well, then perhaps the BBC should let them. New BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead is to make a speech in Oxford today, where she is expected to reinforce concerns that the BBC wage bill was too high . 'If somebody becomes so successful that they command a very large salary, the BBC is not there to stop them. It is there as an incubator of talent.' The committee's report, Future of the BBC, also called for the abolition of the BBC Trust, saying that the governing body was too close to the Corporation and needed to be replaced with a more rigorous body. A speech by Rona Fairhead, in Oxford today is likely to reinforce some of their concerns. ‘The Trust recognises that the outstanding people on screen and on air are at the heart of the BBC, at the same time we are clear that the BBC has a responsibility to spend money wisely in its approach to talent pay,’ she will say. Mrs Fairhead is also at the centre of another controversy about pay, after it emerged that she received more than £500,000 last year for just 50 days work in non-executive roles at the embattled bank, HSBC.","The BBC has boasted of making 'vast' cuts to its wage bill during last year .

The 26-year-old Aussie played at the national stadium three times with York City – twice in the FA Trophy final and once in the Conference Play-off final – as well as Bradford’s 2013 League Two Play-off final win over Northampton Town in 2013. But reaching Wembley in the FA Cup after beating Chelsea and Sunderland in the earlier rounds would top the lot. ‘I’ve been to Wembley six times now and played in four of them and they’re all fantastic occasions, but this would be even more special because it is the FA Cup,’ said Meredith. ‘We don’t get the coverage in Australia like you do over here obviously, but everyone follows the FA Cup. Everyone knows it’s the biggest domestic cup in the world and the great stories that came out of it, my favourite being the Crazy Gang. ‘Now it’s the quarter-finals, people are starting to get excited. I think it’s being shown on Setanta. I know all my family and friends are going to watch it, they’ve worked out a way to stream it. They’re excited about the game and they’ re all getting together to have some food and drinks. Meredith, who has played for seven different English sides since moving from Australia, against Sunderland . ‘One of my best mates flew over for the Chelsea game and it was fantastic because when we scored that fourth goal, somehow I managed to spot him in the away fans and we were cheering really hard at each other. ‘My dad said if we get to the semi-finals, he’ll fly over. It’ll probably just be my dad and my brother or sister. The plane tickets aren’t cheap.’ Meredith left his family home in Australia where he lived with his parents, two younger brothers and sister, to travel to England at the age of 16 and sign as an apprentice at Derby County after being spotted at the club’s academy in Melbourne. After loan spells at Cambridge United and Chesterfield, it didn’t work out at Derby and he went on to have brief spells at Sligo Rovers, Shrewsbury Town and Telford United before joining York. ‘I signed pro at Derby but then I was released,’ Meredith recalled. ‘At that time I really struggled to get a club, like a lot of players do when they have no experience as a professional. The 26-year-old has been to Wembley Stadium six times and played on four of those occasions . Meredith holds off Lukas Podolski during Bradford's win against Arsenal in the 2012 Capital One Cup . ‘I was in the country on my own. At one point I was without a club for six months. I was running in a park in Derby every day on my own like Rocky Balboa. ‘I found it really difficult and I was faced with the decision: do I go back home to Australia or do I really give it a good go and try to make something of myself? ‘I decided to give it a good go and I ended up going all the way down to the Conference North. From there, I’ve had to work as hard as I can to build my career to get to a notable league to do the best I can for myself.’ Meredith is not the only one among a Bradford squad that has exceeded all expectations under manager Phil Parkinson. He added: ‘It’s the whole ethos of the club. It’s what is bred into us by the management staff. They are tough and hard and they want workers. We’re in a working-class city. We have to work hard, do the right thing and look after ourselves properly. That’s what has built this team spirit and enthusiasm. ‘There are no Big-time Charlies at the club, we all work hard for each other.’","Bradford City face Reading in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday .

The former Celtic, Barcelona and Manchester United striker, who started and ended his career at Helsingborg, was speaking at a media day to launch the 2015 Allsvenskan season, with his side kicking off at Kalmar on April 4. Appointed by Helsingborg last November, Golden Boot winner Larsson took over at a club that, although known as a powerhouse in Swedish football, found itself struggling financially. Former Celtic and Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson now manages at his former club side Helsingborg . To arrest the alarming economic slide, Larsson decided the fat wage packets paid by the club would be a thing of the past. With Helsingborg's blessing, he introduced a salary cap reported to be a modest 40,000 Swedish crowns ($4,700) a month -- about half the average wage in the Swedish top flight. 'I won't comment on the sums, but I will say that it's not the wages that Helsingborg used to pay in the past,' Larsson told Reuters. The former Sweden international gets emotional during his last playing appearance for Helsingborg in 2009 . 'I don't mind players earning money, but it should mean at the same time that the club is doing good. 'If the club is doing good, the club is getting income, then the club can share it with the players. But when the situation is not going according to plan, you have to look at the financial bit and see what you can change.' Larsson learned his trade with Helsingborg before traveling the well-worn path taken by Swedish players to the Dutch league, joining Feyenoord before moving to Celtic and winning global recognition, and no shortage of riches, for his scoring feats. Larsson won four Scottish league titles with Celtic and two La Liga titles at Barcelona plus the 2006 Champions League. The 43-year-old finds the back of the net for Sweden in the 2006 World Cup group stage clash with England . Larsson was a prolific scorer for club and country, celebrating against England back in 2006 . He recommended that young Allsvenskan players seeking to emulate his success and that of former Malmo striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic should play to develop their game, rather than their bank account. 'I think that the average wage in Sweden is too high. They won't be financially independent from the money they earn here (Helsingborg). 'They earn good money, but I think there has to be the desire to develop, to go on to a bigger league and earn your money there.' Helsingborg's wage cap might have restricted his options a little but Larsson said the chance to work with one of Europe's great finishers - himself - may have helped attract players. 'It's always difficult, but there are always players that have the desire to do something with their football,' the 43-year-old said. Larsson is a club legend at Celtic, seen here lifting the 2004 SPL title with the club he played at from 1997-04 . 'There are players who tend not to look at the money short-term, they have a bigger plan. I haven't found it that hard to attract good players to the club.' Among the players at his disposal this season is his 17-year-old son Jordan, who signed for the club several months before his father took over as manager. 'When we're at the ground he's a football player like everybody else. Even though he is young I expect him to do what everybody else is doing - I don't make a difference just because he's my son,' Larsson smiled. Having performed the near-miracle of keeping minnows Falkenberg in the Swedish top flight last year, Larsson is looking forward to being back in his home town. 'Everything is possible in football,' he said, not ruling out the possibility of a title run with his new charges. 'But for us the most important thing is to steady the ship and make progress with the team.'

Zlatan Ibrahimovic's harsh dismissal did not prove to be costly as his team-mates beat the odds to score two crucial away goals at Stamford Bridge. Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney took to Twitter to heap praise on the Ligue 1 outfit who, including extra time, played for 89 minutes with a numerical disadvantage. Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic was sent off for a lunging tackle on Chelsea's Oscar . 'That is one of the best performances I've ever seen with 10 men from PSG,' said Rooney. Former Premier League stars Luis Garcia and John Heitinga also lauded the 10 men of PSG for giving their all until the final whistle despite losing a key player during the first half. Here, Sportsmail recalls other examples of when teams have impressed despite at least one of their players heading into the dressing room for an early bath. 10 - St Mirren 0-1 Rangers (March 2010) Cup finals are always tense affairs due to the pressure that surrounds both sets of players in the quest to land a piece of silverware. Kevin Thomson and Danny Wilson were unable to control their emotions as they were sent off for dangerous tackles. Rangers added the 2010 Co-operative Insurance Cup to their trophy cabinet after Kenny Miller saved Thomson and Wilson's blushes by scoring a late winner. Kevin Thomson, pictured being given his marching orders, was sent off in Rangers' Cup win . Rangers boss Walter Smith lifts the CIS Insurance Cup after his side beat St Mirren at Hampden Park . 9 - Chelsea 4-1 West Ham (April 2006) One goal down with a man sent off, Chelsea looked in danger of dropping points in their home fixture against West Ham. James Collins opened the lead in the 10th minute before Maniche's 17th-minute dismissal for a lunge on Lionel Scaloni. However Jose Mourinho's 2005-06 side had a never-say-die attitude. Didier Drogba, Hernan Crespo, John Terry and William Gallas scored at Stamford Bridge to help their side to victory en route to a second successive Premier League title. Referee Chris Foy shows Maniche a red card during Chelsea's league match against West Ham in April 2006 . William Gallas is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring his side's fourth goal . 8 - Bolton 2-3 Arsenal (March 2008) Arsenal were reduced to 10 men in the 31st minute when Abou Diaby received a straight red for an incredibly reckless challenge on Gretar Steinsson. The Gunners were 2-0 down before the interval but Arsene Wenger's side showed great tenacity to claim a win at what was then called the Reebok Stadium thanks to goals by Gallas, Robin van Persie and a fortunate Jloyd Samuel own goal. Arsenal came back from 2-0 down to beat Bolton despite Abou Diaby's sending off . Robin van Persie celebrates with Emmanuel Adebayor after scoring a penalty against Bolton . 7 - Nigeria 1-2 Italy (July 1994) Italy looked to be heading out of the 1994 World Cup during their last-16 match against Nigeria as the Azzurri found themselves reduced to 10 men and one goal down. Substitute Gianfranco Zola saw red just 12 minutes after entering the fray, however Italy launched a comeback to progress to the quarter-finals as Roberto Baggio hit the winning goal in extra time. Gianfranco Zola is shown a red card as Nigeria's Augustine Eguavoen lays on the floor . Italy sealed a spot in the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup despite Zola's moment of madness . 6 - Derby 0-1 QPR (May 2014) Derby and Queens Park Rangers battled it out in a fixture worth £80million for the victors, knowing they will be promoted to the Premier League. The Rams, already dominant, appeared to have been handed a major boost when Gary O'Neil was red carded for a late challenge on Johnny Russell. However being second-best all match, Bobby Zamora scored in the dying stages of the play-off final to seal promotion for QPR. Gary O'Neil wipes his eyes after seeing red during QPR's Championship play-off final match against Derby . Bobby Zamora scored his side's winning goal to help QPR gain promotion to the Premier League . 5 - Tottenham 3-4 Manchester City (February 2004) Manchester City booked a place in the fifth round of the FA Cup back in the 2003-04 campaign by somehow coming back from three goals down to eliminate Tottenham. Their task was made even harder when Joey Barton was sent off after picking up two yellow cards. However, while Barton was licking his wounds in the Manchester City dressing room, then team-mates Sylvain Distin, Paul Bosvelt, Shaun Wright-Phillips and Jon Macken scored past Kasey Keller to help City come back from the dead. Manchester City came from behind to eliminate Tottenham despite Joey Barton's dismissal . Richard Dunne hugs Sun Jihai after helping Manchester City eliminate Tottenham from the FA Cup . 4 - Chelsea 2-2 Paris Saint-Germain (March 2015) As mentioned above, Laurent Blanc will be delighted with the effort of his players following Ibrahimovic's early sending off. Mourinho admitted after the match that his Chelsea side deserved to go out of the Champions League as they failed to capitalise on their numerical advantage. Chelsea's players surrounded Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers after Ibrahimovic's challenge on Oscar . Thiago Silva celebrates after his side progressed to the quarter-finals of the Champions League . 3 - Arsenal 1-2 Manchester United (April 1999) This incredible FA Cup fixture is mainly remembered for Ryan Giggs' incredible solo goal to send Manchester United into the FA Cup final and keep alive his side's dream of winning the treble. But Manchester United's feat was even more impressive given they were reduced to 10 men in the 74th minute when Roy Keane received a second yellow for hacking down Marc Overmars. United were forced into playing the rest of normal time as well as extra time with 10 men but managed to find a way of breaking down Arsenal's resolute defence. Manchester United captain Roy Keane looks furious after his sending off against rivals Arsenal . Ryan Giggs runs away in celebration after scoring past Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman . 2 - Barcelona 2-2 Chelsea (April 2012) Facing a Barcelona side including Lionel Messi, Andres Iniesta and Alexis Sanchez was no easy task at the best of times. Never mind after losing your inspirational captain at the Nou Camp in a Champions League semi-final. Chelsea looked destined to be heading out of Europe's most prestigious competition after John Terry's 37th-minute dismissal, however the Blues found a way of drawing 2-2 to seal a spot in the final, which they would go on to win. Chelsea managed to seal a spot in the 2012 Champions League final despite John Terry's dismissal . Former Chelsea striker Fernando Torres scored in the 90th minute to send the Blues through to the final . 1 - Argentina 0-1 Cameroon (June 1990) An Argentina side including Diego Maradona were left stunned after the opening game of the 1990 World Cup as they were defeated 1-0 by Cameroon. The African nation produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history despite losing Andre Kana-Biyik on the hour mark. Andre's brother Francois Omam-Biyik scored Cameroon's winning goal against the eventual runners-up to ensure Italia 90 started with a bang.

Avoid unnecessary narrative elaboration and redundant language.",7,"Louis van Gaal has been here before with the press questioning him, his players seemingly confused by his philosophy and the public bemused as the season tailspins into mediocrity. The only difference on the previous occasion was that Van Gaal tired of the challenge and gave up. It was 2008 and he was at AZ Alkmaar, an admittedly different proposition to Manchester United. But the ingredients were similar. The club was under-achieving, languishing in 11th place when they had been expected to challenge at the top of the table. And it seemed as if the players could not grasp what he was demanding from them. So Van Gaal walked out. He resigned from Alkmaar in March 2008. Louis van Gaal, pictured in training on Friday, takes Manchester United to face Liverpool at Anfield . Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring United's final goal in their 3-0 win against Tottenham last weekend . Van Gaal, pictured in 2007, resigned as manager of AZ Alkmaar only to return to the club and win the title . But then something remarkable occurred in the form of a players' mutiny. The team rebelled against Van Gaal's own decision to walk out leave them and demanded him back. Led by captain Stijn Schaars, central defender and vice-captain Kew Jaliens, midfielder David Mendes and Australian goalkeeper Joey Didulica the team leaders asked for a crisis meeting with the directors and the owner of the club. 'We felt insulted when the club told us Van Gaal was leaving,' said Kew Jaliens. 'The entire squad, felt that Van Gaal is the right man and the only man who could take this club and our squad to a higher level.' As United travel to Liverpool on Sunday with Champions League qualification hanging in the balance, the question is whether United's players and directors would do the same for Van Gaal today. Of course, thing aren't quite as bad as they were at AZ. After all, three defeats in 24 games would be satisfactory for most clubs. And last week's 3-0 win against Tottenham was a possibly the first sign that a new successful United team could emerge in the post-Ferguson era. Stijn Schaars, pictured during his days as an AZ Alkmaar player, did not want Van Gaal to leave the club . Antonio Valencia, Ander Herrera and Radamel Falcao (left to right) train ahead of their trip to Anfield . Indeed before Sunday's game at Anfield, Van Gaal was confident enough to talking about extending his time at Old Trafford beyond his current three-year deal. 'This will be my last job but there could be five years to go yet,' he said. 'I can extend my contract. You never know. I'm in a situation where I signed for three years because you can build something up in that time and the club agreed with that. I don't know how I would react in the circumstances when Manchester United ask me to extend, and if I should do that.' Perhaps their 3-0 win over Tottenham last weekend could be viewed as the United players own vote of confidence in their manager. Wayne Rooney later revealed that he had spoken to the team the night before and certainly it seemed as though they might have finally 'got' the elusive Van Gaal philosophy. And not before time: Sunday's clash with Liverpool could be defining for judging Van Gaal's first season a success or failure. Put baldy, finish fourth and Van Gaal can be broadly satisfied; finish fifth and he can expect to be questioned as to whether he is still among the top coaches in the world. It is crude and unsatisfactory measure of his first season – a point here or there might make the difference between fourth of fifth. Van Gaal has revealed the United job will be his last but he could extend his contract at Old Trafford . But Van Gaal needs to demonstrate that United are making progress and qualification for the Champions League is the only tangible way to do so. Last Sunday's victory was welcome, but was notable for being one of the few outstanding performances this season. The defeats at Swansea and to Arsenal in the FA Cup are still fresh in the mind. At times United's players seem to be inhibited by Van Gaal. Some at United believe he has been in danger of losing credibility among the players at times when he spoke about his 'philosophy', given the amount of times he has changed his formation. In addition, the players have seemed 'strangled' by Van Gaal at times, said one United source. His sheer intensity seems to overwhelm them. At Bayern Munich they would relate to that. They remember him there as coach brought back discipline to the squad and who introduced fresh intensity and a crisper, sharper passing game, a tactical prerequisite for a modern elite Champions League club. The Bayern players found their standards had to rise considerably to meet Van Gaal's expectations of passing accuracy and the foundations he laid have helped build the success of the club since he left. The Bayern Munich players felt they had to raise their standards considerably while Van Gaal was at the helm . But his discipline eventually was perceived as eccentric and bizarre, according to some at Bayern. The self-confidence, which helped underpin the team as they won the German League and Cup double in the first season and reached the Champions League final, became a liability as he sought to control more and more areas of the club. They still talk with wide-eyed astonishment about the day he dropped his trousers in team talk to demonstrate that he had the 'balls' to drop any of the star players. And they still raise their eyebrows at the manner in which Van Gaal organised meal times after training. Lunch time was a communal affair. And at Bayern, the whole team had to be assembled in matching kit before Van Gaal would give the signal for the meal to start. He once refused to allow the highly-respected club doctor, Hans Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who was then in his 60s, to join in lunch until he had gone back to change his socks. Mueller-Wohlfahrt was in his white club socks and the stipulated dress code was red socks. His obsession with order carries over on the pitch and his greatest strength for some and his biggest weakness for others. Johan Cruyff, his great football adversary, is one of those unimpressed with his need to control. Johan Cruyff says Van Gaal is a very good organiser but that's not the way he likes to do things . 'The difference is that he always organises a lot of things for people,' said Cruyff. 'I always use the basic quality of people to achieve what I want to achieve. That's a different way of thinking. I always love that they do things. And when it goes wrong, well, try to correct it in one way or another. His way is more as a very good organiser. That's the way he is' Of course, when he gets it right and a club or a group of players buy into what he has to offer, Van Gaal can be phenomenally successful as his time, at Ajax and his early days at Barcelona and Bayern demonstrate. And, of course, at AZ Alkmaar. That famous meeting, when the players begged him to stay at the Dutch club was a heated and emotional affair in which Van Gaal demanded the fill support and commitment of the players if he were to stay. The players agreed. The following season they won the Dutch league, the first time for 27 years that it had been won by a team other than PSV Eindhoven, Ajax or Feyenoord. If he can do the same for United next season, his genius will be confirmed. If they lose on Sunday and the club's trajectory doesn't change, he won't need to worry about what to do when he sitting down with the Glazers to extend his contract.

It’s not an image you’d naturally conjure of the world No 1, but it is a remarkably striking one. And thank goodness for the kilt... The picture – which has been described as both “genius” and “weird” by various Twitter judges – appears on the front cover of Golf Digest’s latest issue. The prestigious magazine describes McIlroy as ‘the new model for greatness’. The Northern Irishman is gearing up for his latest crack at winning the Masters, which tees off in on April 9. A win on Augusta National’s hallowed fairways would ensure McIlroy’s third major in succession and a career Grand Slam. Only Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, and Tiger Woods hold that most prestigious honour of winning all four majors. Rory McIlroy poses as Michelangelo's David on the front cover of Golf Digest's latest issue . How Michelangelo's masterpiece looks in comparison with McIlroy on the golf course . McIlroy revealed to the magazine some of the secrets behind his stunning success in 2014, during which he won The Open and US PGA Championship and played a pivotal role in Europe’s Ryder Cup success at Gleneagles – usurping Woods as the sport’s current superstar. The 25-year-old’s new dedication to the gym, a focus on perfecting his craft following his break-up with Caroline Wozniacki and a deliberate steeling of a gentle soul are the key factors McIlroy offers as to his recent dominanace. ‘After [the break-up], I thought “What else do I have in my life. I have family and friends, but they're always going to be there. What else?” That's when I decided “You know what, I'm just going to immerse myself in golf for a while.” I spent more time at it, thought about it more, spent more time at the range and at the gym. Because that's all I had, and that's all I wanted to do,"" he told Golf Digest. The Ulsterman believes his brilliant form last year was due in part to his new fitness regime . McIlroy also reveals how he changed his mindset after breaking up with Caroline Wozniacki . 'I've come across enough successful people now to know that the best in whatever walk of life, they're the ones who just work the hardest. I realised that if I want to be the best and fulfill my potential, I'm going to have to do the same thing.' McIlroy talks about how his swing has improved thanks to his new fitness regime strengthening the “big muscles” in his core. His gruelling 90-minute gym sessions are taken 10 times a week under the gaze of fitness instructor Steve McGregor. The Holywood-born star also offers a fascinating insight into his psyche, revealing that he felt for a long time that being a winner was a selfish trait and an unnatural one for his character. McIlroy is preparing to return to Augusta National for another crack at the Masters . McIlroy holds both the Open and US PGA titles . ""Until just a few years ago, I don't want to say I felt guilty for being successful because I had this ability given to me, but it was sort of like, “Why me?”. ""Because I felt like it's a very selfish thing to be a winner, a very selfish trait. Which is what you sort of need in golf. And I guess it just took me a while to be comfortable with that, just because of the personality I have. I realized that if I want to succeed in golf, which I do, I need to have it. What helped was realizing how much people like winners, how people gravitate to them. So if other people are happy for me winning, then why can I not be?"" McIlroy insists that now “I want to win at golf all the time... I feel like I've developed a bit of a ruthless streak on the golf course”. But he admits that he tends to be “too nice” and will deliberately lose a game of cards or pool “just to keep (his opponent) happy."" It is 10 years since Woods won his fourth and most recent Masters, and a McIlroy victory at Augusta National would herald a new era in golf. Woods can seemingly not stay fit for long enough to compete against McIlroy, and the pair have become friends off the course – an unlikely scenario were Woods still at his ultra-competitive peak. McIlroy offers another insight into the relationship between the two greatest golfers of their generation, saying ""He wants to help (me). He's like “'I know you're getting into the same sort of position as me, so anything you need to know, we've been through it all.””","Rory McIlroy has been pictured in stunning pose for magazine cover .

United were dumped out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday and face a battle to finish in the top four with a difficult run of fixtures over the next six weeks. And former United midfielder Scholes, who has two season tickets at his old club, is unconvinced that Van Gaal's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad. Louis van Gaal gives instructions to Ashley Young during Manchester United's defeat by Arsenal . Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected at Old Trafford . Arsene Wenger was right! I would have loved to have played with Mesut Ozil... but only if he always performed like he did at Old Trafford . Writing in his column for The Independent, Scholes said: 'Watching United at Old Trafford on Monday, I know what Louis van Gaal is trying to do with this team. I do like the concept. I just question whether he has the players to do it. 'In recent weeks, Van Gaal has tried what I would describe as a more Barcelona-style approach to games. His centre backs push wide, the full backs push on and the team pass the ball. It has worked against the weaker teams but it is against the stronger sides, starting with Spurs and the high-pressing game they play, that you have to wonder whether it will be found out. 'To play this way, you really need to be exceptional. Barcelona can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years. United have spent around £220m in the last three transfer windows and yet I would question whether they have the players to operate this system.' Van Gaal has been criticised for utilising Fellaini's height and physical presence at times this season . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes the club must buy more new players this summer . United were known for their relentless attacking under Sir Alex Ferguson and Scholes, who was an integral part of the Scot's midfield, wants to see fluid football back at Old Trafford. 'I understand what Van Gaal is trying to do,' Scholes wrote. 'I like that he is playing with the wide players. I also know that as former players we cannot harp on about the old days for ever. Things change, although I believe that certain principles, of attacking, entertaining football, should always be protected. 'Like any other match-going fan – I have two season tickets for Old Trafford – I want to see the team play well and win. I just don’t think this system is the best for these players.' Angel di Maria has struggled to adapt since joining the club in a £60million deal from Real Madrid . Former Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata has found himself out of favour under Van Gaal in recent months . Van Gaal's men are fourth in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham but they could drop out of the Champions League places if they suffer defeat and rivals Liverpool win at Swansea on Monday night. Despite the club's precarious position, Scholes is adamant that the Dutchman has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window. He added: 'I still believe that Van Gaal is the right man for the job. I don’t think he will change his mind about the way he wants the team to play. He is a stubborn man and that is no bad thing in football. But I am afraid to say that if he wants to play this Barcelona style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it.'","Paul Scholes believes Louis van Gaal is trying to play a 'Barcelona style'

Short video, which was uploaded earlier today, shows a dejected 'John Terry' standing on the platform of the Paris metro as a train pulls into the station. The carriage is packed with a gang of PSG fans, who are chanting 'Here is Paris' in a good humoured fashion at the man, who is wearing a replica  shirt bearing the Chelsea captain's name. A dejected 'John Terry' stands on a Paris Metro station following his side's Champions League exit . The man, wearing a Terry 26 jersey waits for the speeding train to stop before he can board . Unfortunately, the carriage is full of jubilant Paris St Germain fans who are through to the next round . As the fake John Terry attempts to board the train, he is pushed back by the smiling fans. The video is a response to a video featuring Chelsea fans on the Paris metro where a black man is prevented from boarding the train. As the train pulls away from the station, the sad-looking John Terry lowers his head as he contemplates the end of his Champions League dream. In a final barb to Chelsea fans, the video features a shot of a sign with the Champions League logo and Berlin 2015 - where the final is being held. Chelsea had offered the victim of the Paris metro racism row a free trip to last night's second leg. But the victim, Soulemayne S said he could not go to the game because of the impact of last month's incident. He said: 'This offer to go, this invitation, is just an attempt to make things up. For the moment I don't want to come because of what they've caused, the team and their fans. 'The Chelsea supporters have destroyed me. Even when I drive my car I feel like I'm being followed. I don't know if I am being followed by Chelsea fans, or police or the media. The John Terry-a-like is stopped from boarding the train by a group of fans who are chanting . The John Terry character tries several time to board the train without any success . The train departs leaving the spoof John Terry, like the real version, going nowhere in Europe this season . 'Even when I go and see my lawyer I am followed, when I go to see my therapist I feel like I'm being followed, and I've never had that in my life. 'The only problem I have in my life right now is because of Chelsea and their fans.' Meanwhile, five men linked to the incident have been served with summonses to appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 'regarding a police application for football banning orders'. Football banning orders are issued by courts following a conviction for a football-related offence after a complaint by the Crown Prosecution Service or local police, the Home Office website says.

He tore into controversial campaigner Asim Qureshi today branding suggestions UK authorities caused the ISIS killer's radicalisation '100% the wrong way up'. The outspoken mayor then added: 'If you're a human rights group then you should be sticking up for the human rights of those who are being beheaded in Syria and northern Iraq.' Scroll down for video . London mayor Boris Johnson today hit back at the group who have blamed the radicalisation of Jihadi John on British security services . Mr Johnson (left) slammed prisoners' rights group Cage after the group's leader Asim Qureshi (right) called into his radio show and claimed security services may have made Jihadi John feel unwelcome in the UK . Prisoners rights group Cage held a press conference in which they called Mohammed Emwazi - unmasked as Jihadi John last week - 'a beautiful man' who was 'harassed' by British security services. After widespread condemnation of the group and their comments, the London Mayor took on Qureshi, the group's leader, today. Qureshi called into Mr Johnson's radio show on London's LBC radio this morning, claiming his defence of Emwazi had been 'unfairly represented'. But Mr Johnson refused to go back on his previous criticism of the group and slammed Mr Qureshi's claims. The Tory mayor said: 'I really, really think that the focus of your indignation and outrage should be at people who go out and join groups that throw gays off cliffs, that behead people who don't subscribe to their version of Islam, that glorify in the execution of innocent journalists and aid workers. 'They should be the object of your wrath, not the security services who are trying to keep us safe.' Families of the victims of ISIS killer Jihadi John (pictured) - unmasked last week as west Londoner Mohammed Emwazi - have also slammed Cage's comments, branding Emwazi 'a monster' Mr Johnson said the group's claims sent out the completely wrong message, adding: 'If you're going to have an impact on the lives of young Muslims you have to focus on what these people are doing wrong and not instantly scatter blame around.' But Mr Kureshi refused to change his line and replied: 'What we want is to understand whether or not, the security agencies, their actions led to [Emwasi] feeling that he did not belong to UK society.' Mr Johnson, who looked furious on a video of the broadcast filmed in the studio, replied: 'I just feel that you've got it 100% the wrong way up. You need to see this thing differently. 'The security services are trying to keep is safe. They cannot conceivably be blamed for their actions trying to prevent people from committing such atrocities.' Qureshi's group press conference last week was broadcast live for 52 minutes on the BBC and 58 on Sky News, with Qureshi speaking uninterrupted for 18 minutes. Mr Johnson is the latest politician to hit out at the perceived apologists for ISIS killers. In a statement to the Commons yesterday, Home Secretary Theresa May said: ‘I condemn anyone who attempts to excuse that barbarism in the way that has been done by Cage.’ The row came after a shocking press conference last week, at which Cage said Jihadi John was 'beautiful' And Jacqui Smith, a Labour former Home Secretary, added: ‘We can – and should – dismiss the outrageous apologists of Cage who claimed that Emwazi was just a good lad radicalised by the actions of western authorities.’ Families of the victim's of Jihadi John's killing spree have also attacked Cage's defence of the murderer. Reg Henning, brother of British aid worker Alan Henning who died at the ISIS executioner's hands, said: 'If he's a ""beautiful, kind man"", why is he killing innocent civilians? 'He's a monster. Everyone should be doing everything they can to capture him and bring him to justice - not stick up for him like he's been hard done by.' Qureshi previously urged protestors at a protest outside the US embassy to 'support the jihad of our brothers and sisters' in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine and Chechnya'. Speaking through a microphone at the 2006 pan-Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir movement rally, he said: 'When we see the example of our brothers and sisters fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan, then we know where the example lies. Cage's comments last week has sparked a charity commission investigation into organisations, including the Joseph Rowntree trust and Body Shop founder Anita Roddick's Roddick Foundation, who fund the group. Qureshi appeared at a protest in 2006 at which he said Muslims were being oppressed by the West and called for support for jihad, shouting: 'Allahu Akhbar! Allahu Akhbar!'","'Human rights' group  sparked outrage claiming ISIS killer was 'beautiful'

Reigning world champion Hamilton claimed pole, fastest lap and race win in the opening grand prix of the campaign in Australia earlier this month. With team-mate Nico Rosberg second it was abundantly clear Mercedes will take some stopping again this term following a dominant 2014. Lewis Hamilton poses for a picture with a fan at a meet-and-greet session in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday . Hamilton is expected to go head-to-head with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg once more in 2015 . Hamilton has vowed to create history at Mercedes as he bids to win his third world championship . Mercedes set a new record for victories in a season with 16 from the 19 races, surpassing the prior mark of 15 set by McLaren in 1988 and Ferrari in 2002 and again in 2004. The German manufacturing giant also equalled Red Bull's 2011 record of 18 poles for the year, with their only blip in Austria where both Hamilton and Rosberg made errors to let in Williams' Felipe Massa. The worry for Mercedes' rivals this year is the team appear to have taken a step forward, with Hamilton showing no let up in his desire to make it three world titles. 'In terms of my performance I've got more to come,' said Hamilton ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix. 'I've been spending time with the engineers and I'm going to work really hard to understand. 'Last year when I went to Malaysia I went fresh. It was like my first race of the year. The British driver appeared in relaxed spirits as he sets sights on a third Formula One title . The Mercedes drivers look set to dominate the remainder of the season after setting the pace in Australia . Rosberg and Hamilton sign autographs for the dozens Mercedes-supporting fans in Malaysia . 'I went into the race not really knowing how long the tyres would last, but what happened turned out to be exceptional. 'After that race there was this big debrief and a document done to explain everything I did. 'Now I've won in Australia I'm going to extract everything from my data and see how I can better my performance. I definitely feel in this next race I can be better than I was last time out.' Asked of Hamilton whether it was Mercedes' target to win every race this season, he replied: 'The target's always been to win every race, even in the bad days. 'But this year we have an awesome car with improved reliability, so the target is to create history again.' Hamilton won in Malaysia last year ahead of Mercedes team-mate Rosberg . Hamilton is aware, however, of the potential perils and pitfalls that lie ahead which could scupper such aspirations. 'To pick up where we left off last year was awesome, but if 2014 showed us anything it's that putting together a whole season is never easy,' assessed Hamilton. 'Winning the first race is just one small step in a long journey and I'm not reading anything into it. 'The next step is Malaysia and that's all I've been focusing on since we left Melbourne. 'The race is really tough with the heat and humidity, but I feel ready for anything right now and the aim is to repeat last year's performance. 'It took me eight attempts to win this race before I finally made it to the top step last year. I don't plan on waiting that long again. 'From an outsider's perspective it appeared Hamilton crucially drew first blood in what is expected to be another intense season-long battle with Rosberg. Hamilton, though, suggested otherwise, stating: 'Psychologically it doesn't make any difference for me. 'I won the championship again last year, and I felt like it wasn't a fluke. I'm deserving of where I am. 'And I worked damn hard to get that win in Australia. Again there wasn't any luck involved.'","Lewis Hamilton heads into Malaysian Grand Prix leading the championship .

Daily paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks, stroke and early death, a major study warns today. It found that patients prescribed high doses of the painkiller for long periods were up to 63 per cent more likely to die unexpectedly. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed. Paracetamol is considered by doctors to be safer than aspirin, which can cause stomach bleeds, and ibuprofen, which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes. But British researchers who looked at studies involving 666,000 patients say the risks may have been underestimated and are calling for a major review to be conducted into the drug’s safety. They think paracetamol may be causing illness by preventing the action of an enzyme in the body called COX-2. Scientists from the Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine looked at eight studies that contained information on patients taking paracetamol daily for up to 14 years, for conditions such as arthritis and severe back pain. They also covered patients who took the medicine less often or hardly at all. Philip Conaghan, who led the research, pointed out that for most patients the risks were very small and those given paracetamol over a long period would have illnesses likely to kill them early. For this reason it was difficult to be sure the drugs were causing problems. But the professor added: ‘I am a bit worried that paracetamol at high dose for long periods could be associated with side effects that we hadn’t previously associated.’ He said patients being prescribed the drugs for long periods for arthritis or muscle and joint pain should talk to their doctor about alternative treatments, such as exercise. Published in the journal, Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, the study concluded: ‘Given its high usage and availability, a systematic review of paracetamol’s efficacy and tolerability in individual conditions is warranted.’ Professor Conaghan said it was not possible from the studies to work out how the average person’s lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke would increase if they took paracetamol for a long period. The risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed, for those who took the drug for longer periods . Statistically, one in six men and one in ten women will die from heart attacks, strokes and other complications of heart disease. Other scientists played down the risks. Professor Nick Bateman, who specialises in clinical toxicology at the University of Edinburgh, said: ‘Based on this study the risk is minimal. Paracetamol remains the safest analgesic available, and this study should not stop people taking it. ‘Based on these results, the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period is advised, this is common sense for all medicines.’ Paracetamol is the most commonly used painkiller in the UK and 22.5million prescriptions are handed out each year. A further 200million packs are sold over the counter. Although the NHS does not keep figures, evidence from Canada suggests that 5 per cent of the population are given at least one high dose prescription of paracetamol over the course of a year. A 2013 Oxford study warned that for every 1,000 patients on ibuprofen or a similar drug, three would suffer a heart attack within a year, of which one would be fatal.","Those taking drug for long periods up to 63% more likely to die suddenly .

Model Anna Duritskaya, 23, was walking with Nemtsov on Friday night when a gunman shot the politician about 100 meters (330 feet) from the Kremlin. ""She was crying and she was saying Boris had been killed and he's lying next to me,"" said her mother, Inna Duritskaya. ""She was in such shock she couldn't say anything else."" Duritskaya said her daughter was questioned until 2 a.m. Monday. She said she fears authorities will implicate her daughter in the death because they have threatened to take her attorney away from her. The model had been staying at the apartment of an aide to Nemtsov under constant police guard. Late Monday, Yevhen Perebyinis, a spokesman for Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, tweeted that Duritskaya had left Moscow for Kiev. The assassination has spawned a flood of conspiracy theories. Nemtsov was one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, and many suspect the Kremlin of either direct or indirect involvement. Inna Duritskaya said her daughter knew the risks of getting involved with the prominent opposition leader. ""Of course when I heard she was dating him it was a bit of a shock,"" she said. ""Then when I met him in person I liked him a lot as a person. He was straightforward, he treated my daughter very well, she was happy. And I couldn't influence it anyway; my daughter did what she wanted to. Of course, I was worried and scared, but I couldn't change it anyway."" Thousands of Nemtsov supporters gathered Sunday in Moscow to mourn the death of the 55-year-old, who was deputy prime minister during President Boris Yeltsin's administration. The event took place the same day Nemtsov was supposed to lead a rally in Moscow decrying Russia's policies on Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Saturday that Nemtsov was about to reveal information that would be damaging to Russian interests, Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news agency reported. ""A few weeks ago I had a conversation with him on how to build relations between Ukraine and Russia, as we would like them to be,"" Ukrinform quoted Poroshenko as saying. ""Boris said that he was going to make public the strong evidence for participation of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Someone was very afraid of that. Boris was not afraid, the executioners were afraid. They killed him."" Putin condemned the killing and ordered three law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting, the Kremlin said. The President also wrote to Nemtsov's mother, saying he shared her grief, and promised to bring those behind the killing to justice, the Kremlin said. Police said they are looking for a man with short hair who stands between 5 feet 7 inches and 5 feet 9 inches, Russia's Sputnik news agency reported. The shooter was wearing blue jeans and a brown sweater. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation is offering a reward of 3 million rubles ($49,000) for information leading to the arrest of the killer. It said the tipster will be guaranteed anonymity. On Monday, the Russian television station Dozhd published an interview with Anna Duritskaya after her release. Duritskaya told the interviewer she did not see who killed Nemtsov, but that when she turned around she saw a light-colored car driving away. Duritskaya said that her wish was to go home to Ukraine to see her mother and that she did not believe she could attend Nemtsov's funeral on Tuesday. Speculation has pointed blame at everyone from Putin, to a Putin associate, to someone just irked by Nemtsov's business activities. ""I doubt it was a direct order from Putin, but it was this toxic atmosphere of hatred,"" Russian pro-democracy activist Garry Kasparov said. ""It has been propagated by Russian television 24/7."" Nemtsov's friend and political colleague Ilya Yashin blamed Putin more directly: ""It's clearly a political murder,"" Yashin said. ""I don't know who killed Boris, but I know that it's the government and personally Putin who are responsible for it."" Putin offered a different theory: that the killing was a contract hit, but one meant to fire up political strife, his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. One man near the site of Nemtsov's memorial said he thinks the killer was a Putin opponent. ""I don't think Putin did this,"" he told CNN. ""I think this was some radical group that wants to make Putin look bad."" Nemtsov had said he was at risk for assassination. He told the Russian newspaper Sobesednik last month that he was ""a little bit"" afraid his mother's fears that Putin would have him killed would come true. But he added, ""I'm not afraid of him that much. If I was afraid I wouldn't be heading an opposition party and do what I'm doing."" Opinion: The complicated life and tragic death of Boris Nemtsov . Critics of Putin have in the past suffered miserable fates. Last year, a Moscow court sentenced five men to prison for the 2006 killing of Russian journalist and fierce Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya. Business magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky accused Putin of corruption and spent 10 years in prison and labor camps. Late last year, Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny was found guilty of fraud in a politically charged trial. Russia's official news agency reported Monday that a request by Navalny to attend Nemtsov's funeral had been denied. And before his death, Nemtsov had been arrested several times for speaking against Putin's government. Kasparov, chairman of the Human Rights Foundation's International Council, suggested the killing was linked to the Kremlin's own insecurity. ""If you are popular your critics don't have to be shot down in front of the Kremlin,"" Kasparov tweeted. ""Putin is just food in a prison, eat it or starve."" CNN's Diana Magnay reported from Kiev, Ukraine; Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; and Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Matthew Chance in Moscow contributed to this report.","Girlfriend Anna Duritskaya is under constant pressure by police, her mother says .

Avoid unnecessary narrative elaboration and redundant language.",17,"When Gareth Bale scored in the final of the European Cup and the Spanish Cup in the same season last year, he did something for Real Madrid that only Raul and Ferenc Puskas had managed before him. We can be fairly sure that no one ever tried to kick Puskas’ 1959 Mercedes 180 as it pulled out of the club’s training ground. The same cannot be said for Bale’s white Bentley, which was attacked as he left Madrid’s Valdebebas training complex in the early hours of Monday morning after the Clasico. Gareth Bale has joined up with the Wales national team ahead of their upcoming match against Israel . Bale's car was attacked by angry Real Madrid fans following their 2-1 defeat by Barcelona on Sunday . The world's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club's Valdebebas training base . The £86million signing's white Bentley is struck by this fan while others jeered Wales international Bale . Bale has struggled to replicate the form he had shown during his first season at Real Madrid . Bale would not expect to have earned the same level of respect as the ‘Galloping Major’, who won three European Cups and scored 156 league goals in 180 games, but he has four trophies in his first year-and-a-half at the club, so the animosity he has encountered is impossible to justify and hard to understand. ‘He scored the winner in the Spanish Cup final; he scored the winner in the Champions League final. He is already a Real Madrid legend,’ gushed Madrid sports daily Marca when Bale won the European Cup in Lisbon last May. Its rival publication in the Spanish capital, Diaro AS added: ‘Marcelo and (Cristiano) Ronaldo both scored afterwards but Bale’s was the winner because it was game-over after that.’ Those two publications have changed their tune 10 months on — dedicating pages to fan polls that call for the Welshman to be dropped. On Tuesday, 70 per cent of 8,000 supporters responding to one online survey said they wanted Bale left out of the team. There was no shortage of ammunition in the Madrid press, with statistics such as ‘he never set foot in the penalty area in the second half against Barca’ and ‘he only played seven passes after the break — just three more than Lucas Silva who came on three minutes from time’. The fan tries to give the car a kick as Bale pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in Spain . Bale and his Madrid team-mates lost 2-1 at the Nou Camp on Sunday night in a fiercely-contested El Clasico . An estimated 400 million people watched Bale struggle on television as Real moved four points behind Barca . Following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of Monday morning outside Ciudad Real Madrid, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to outline the following: . 1. The Club has already identified the individuals responsible, one a Real Madrid member, for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players. 2. Details of this member's identity were sent to the Club's Discipline Commission, requesting that it expel the individual from Real Madrid for what is considered a very serious offence. 3. This afternoon, the Discipline Commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual's rights as a member and access to the Santiago Bernabéu or any Real Madrid facilities. 4. Real Madrid has notified Spain's National Anti-Violence Commission of the incidents that took place, as well as the identities of the individuals responsible, requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate. 5. Furthermore, Real Madrid will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents. All this supposedly supports the theory that Bale is in decline. But behind the numbers the story is a little more complicated than his critics care to admit. Bale came back to pre-season training in peak physical condition last summer and was comfortably the club’s best player on the tour of the US, scoring in friendlies against Manchester United and Inter Milan. When Real Madrid went on a run of 22 straight wins, Bale scored in the 5-1 win over Basle that began that hot streak, he got two in the next game that saw them beat Deportivo 8-2 and netted again in the 5-1 win over Cordoba that followed. But a thigh injury suffered in October saw him miss three weeks of the season and in his absence Carlo Ancelotti fielded a midfield quartet of James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos, Luka Modric and Isco. And that is where many of his current problems began. Bale has been criticised by Real supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 . Bale followed in the footsteps of former Real Madrid duo Ferenc Puskas (left) and Raul by scoring in the final of the European Cup and the Spanish Cup during the same season . The Wales international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against Levante on March 15 . Real Madrid superstar Bale (right) will be hoping to lead Chris Coleman's Wales to Euro 2016 . Wales, who are currently just one point behind Group B leaders Israel, need Bale to be firing on all cylinders . The team kept winning and with the four passing midfielders the football resembled that played by Pep Guardiola’s Barcelona which many Madrid followers had spent so long envying. The purists loved it and they also loved Isco’s part in it — a Malaga lad who felt like one of their own. Bale came back into the team and his part in the club’s historic run picked up where it had left off, scoring in the 2-0 win over San Lorenzo that made Real Madrid world club champions in December. But when the run came to an end in their next competitive game against Valencia, the season began to unravel and he became the scapegoat. In the defeat by Valencia he was blamed for squandering a late chance and ignoring Karim Benzema’s screams for a pass. The idea that he should make way for Isco now went hand in hand with the theory that he was selfish. Ronaldo did him no favours in the next game when he very publicly chastised him for shooting instead of passing late in a match against Espanyol. ‘Puta’ (f***!) shouted the Portuguese throwing his arms down in disgust. Bale’s every touch from there on in was whistled, despite the fact that he had scored direct from a free-kick earlier in the game — something that Ronaldo hasn’t done now in over 50 attempts. The under-current of competition between Bale and Ronaldo is another factor. It is no secret that president Florentino Perez sees Bale as Ronaldo’s eventual successor both on the pitch as a match winner and off it as a big-money contract winner. Cracks appear to be appearing in Bale's relationship with Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo . Bale and his girlfriend Emma Rhys-Jones must decide where their young daughter goes to school . Ronaldo is not enamoured with the idea of being replaced by anyone and, despite the fact Bale lives in the same luxury ‘La Finca’ neighbourhood as Ronaldo, there is not the closeness between the two that has developed at Barcelona between Neymar and Lionel Messi. When Ronaldo threw a party for his 30th birthday, Bale was invited but did not attend — perhaps wisely, considering the fall-out that followed the festivities, coming as they did on the day of a 4-0 Madrid-derby defeat. Bale’s partner Emma Rhys-Jones lives with him in Madrid although, with a young daughter Alba-Violet not yet three years of age, frequent trips can be made back to Wales. At some point in the future a decision will have to be made about schools. And he will need to be a sure that Madrid is the right city to justify putting down deeper roots. He says he barely noticed the thugs who tried to kick his car as he drove away from the training ground at 1.30am on Monday. But how long before the lack of respect from supporters, commentators and at times even team-mates begins to take its toll? Tuesday marked 10 months to the day since Madrid won the Champions League and Bale arrived back in the city at 4.30am to be greeted by an open-top bus that took him through streets filled with jubilant supporters. The Madrid homecomings are not as pleasant as they used to be.","Gareth Bale's car was attacked after Real Madrid were beaten by Barcelona .

The poll, commissioned by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft also saw Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg likened to Fred from Scooby Doo. While Ukip's Nigel Farage was associated with tough-guy actor Ray Winstone. A new poll has shown that voters most associate David Cameron with the Wacky Races cartoon character Dick Dastardly, right . Voters likened Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, to comic character Mr Bean, right, played by Rowan Atkinson . The survey comes as the poll that a study of marginal constituencies suggests Labour and the Conservatives are heading for electoral 'deadlock' in May, with neither party able to govern. It also revealed that a dramatic surge by the SNP looks set to claim Gordon Brown’s seat and rob Labour of a Commons majority. It suggests the Scottish nationalists are on course for a landslide in May, winning as many as 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats – up from just six at present. The SNP surge would claim seats held by a string of household names, including Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. The Tories are also in danger of losing their one Scottish seat. The poll suggests that Labour and the Conservatives will be tied on 272 seats each – well short of the 326 needed to command a Commons majority. Fred from Scooby Doo, right, was the TV character the voters polled most associated with Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg . The poll also revealed that Ukip leader Nigel Farage, left, is associated with tough guy actor Ray Winstone, right . Lord Ashcroft said the astonishing surge by the SNP in the wake of last year’s independence referendum had thrown a ‘giant spanner in Labour’s works’. The poll suggests a weak Ed Miliband government propped up by the Scottish nationalists could be likely. The two parties would have a combined total of 328 seats – producing a Commons majority of just three. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who is planning a return to Westminster, could become deputy prime minister in any deal. His party has ruled out supporting the Conservatives. Gordon Brown’s seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country . And it has warned that it will demand a ruinously high price from Labour, including billions more in spending and borrowing, home rule for Scotland and the scrapping of Britain’s Trident nuclear deterrent. Gordon Brown’s Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath seat, where the former prime minister is stepping down, currently has one of the biggest Labour majorities in the country. But the new poll forecasts an incredible 28.5 per cent swing to the SNP, giving the nationalists a comfortable six-point lead. In Edinburgh South West, where former chancellor Alistair Darling is also stepping down, the poll predicts an SNP win with a 22 per cent swing. The Scottish nationalists are also set to win Ross, Skye and Lochaber, which Mr Kennedy has held since 1983. New Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is forecast to cling on in East Renfrewshire – but he could be one of only two Labour MPs remaining. Polling was also conducted in a number of marginal seats in England and Wales. The Tories are set to hold on in Vale of Glamorgan as well as Colne Valley, West Yorkshire, where they are narrowly ahead.

Devastated by his plight and the hopelessness of his situation, she enquired about adopting him. Already an owner of three rescue dogs from Soi Dog, Amanda very soon had her fourth. And while Miracle quickly got to work returning the favour to his new owner by creating a powerful bond with her son Kyle that transformed the young boy's life. Kyle was born with cerebral palsy, and was later diagnosed with autism. His condition means that it is incredibly difficult for him to communicate with his family. After learning that autistic people can develop extremely close relationships with canine pets, Amanda decided to adopt some dogs. Kyle and Miracle have since developed a close bond, which Amanda says reveals an unspoken mutual understanding. Amanda (pictured here with Miracle and Kyle) says there is an 'unspoken language' between the hound and her disabled son . She said: 'They’ve both faced so much hardship in their lives, it’s like there’s an unspoken language between them. 'When Kyle gets upset because he can’t convey what he wants to, Miracle will go and lay at his side for Kyle to touch and stroke. 'Miracle seems to automatically know when Kyle needs him.' 'If Kyle simply wants some attention, Miracle will go over and shower him with kisses, and it works the other way too.' Amanda adopted Miracle after seeing his photograph on a Soi Dog Facebook post - he has now made a full recovery . She continued: 'Kids can build up confidence in dogs where they seek solace, and Miracle gets this in abundance from Kyle.' The unique bond between man and dog is still yet to be explained fully but Amanda says the amount it has helped Kyle is unlimited. She said: 'He seems so much happier in the presence of Miracle. 'It’s like they’re soul mates.' Miracle won £1,500 for his Crufts Eukaneba Friends for Life award, and Amanda will share the money between Soi Dog and the Autistic Society.","Crossbreed Miracle was destined for the dog meat restaurants of Hanoi .

Maintain a brief, factual, and informative style.",1,"There was a time in 2012 when just about every selfie going was doctored by a grinning picture of John Terry, super-imposed in his full Chelsea kit and lifting the European Cup. Their captain popped up all over the internet, a subject of ridicule after missing the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in the Allianz Arena through suspension. This time he wore the Chelsea strip for real, lifting the Capital One Cup high up in the Wembley stands and dancing like a dad in front of their celebrating fans behind the goal in the West Stand. John Terry lifts the Capital One Cup after captaining Chelsea to victory over Tottenahm Hotspur . Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris watches as Terry's shot finds the back of the net during the first half . Diego Costa, Terry and Gary Cahill celebrate the opening goal of the game in London . Terry was man of the match here by a distance, driving this team towards their first trophy since Jose Mourinho returned with a performance that sent shivers down the spine. He scored Chelsea’s opener on the stroke of half-time, a finish that settled any anxiety and pretty much any doubt about the destination of this year’s Capital One Cup. After that, he was peerless. The Capital One Cup is a level or two down from the European Cup, or the three Barclays Premier League titles he has won at Chelsea during a 17-year career at Stamford Bridge — but one look at the Chelsea captain told you it really mattered. This was further confirmation, as if it were needed, of his class. His last-ditch tackle on Tottenham’s talisman Harry Kane, sprinting across to cover for his team-mate Gary Cahill in the final minutes here, evoked memories of the days when he was rated best in the world in his position. Former Atletico Madrid forward Costa had a hand in the second goal of the game on Sunday afternoon . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho and Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino watch on from the sidelines . Goalscorer Terry celebrates with Costa during their Capital One Cup final win in London . It hurt like hell for Terry to miss out on the Champions League final, that one night in Munich when Chelsea finally realised their ambition to win the biggest club cup in European football. At the age of 34 he plays one season at a time now, waiting for the call from Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo or director Marina Granovskaia to tell him that he will be staying on for another campaign. That conversation is coming, ‘a formality’ according to Mourinho recently as Terry matured into a new role at the heart of the Chelsea defence. Incredible as it sounds, opposition managers and their players have yet to suss out that Terry has passed on the main responsibility of marking to his usual central defensive partner Cahill. That savvy move added another five years to Alessandro Costacurta’s career with AC Milan when it was put to him by Carlo Ancelotti at the turn of the millennium. Here, after lifting the first trophy since Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge, Terry played like he could go on for another thousand years. Terry slides in to block a shot from Tottenham's top scorer Harry Kane during the second half . Mourinho has been instrumental in Terry's return to form, inspiring new motivation in his captain . Fellow defender Cahill has taken over many of the marking duties that Terry used to perform himself . Kane went cold here, frozen out by the discipline of Cahill — comfortably his best performance of the season — and the organisational ability of Chelsea’s captain alongside him. Cahill was terrorised by Kane in the 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane on January 1, roughed up by the Tottenham striker and losing his guaranteed place in Chelsea’s team as a result. Terry is talking this team through games, just as Marcel Desailly did when he returned to Stamford Bridge after winning the World Cup with France in 1998. Terry has matured these past couple of years and it is at times like this when you begin to wonder what else he could have achieved if he had kept his nose clean. The rehabilitation will never quite be complete, never quite final because he has never spoken about the day in 2011 when he racially insulted Anton Ferdinand. He really ought to speak about it because even if the words he used at Loftus Road that day are unacceptable, society will accept an apology, or a least an explanation. Football can be a forgiving place. The Chelsea squad celebrate their cup success following the final whistle in the capital . Didier Drogba, Terry and full back Branislav Ivanovic celebrate their first trophy since Mourinho's return . Chelsea's captain and manager embrace after the Portuguese coach's first trophy since 2012 . Chelsea supporters see him differently, in awe as he added to his collection of trophies by hauling his team towards their first major honour of the new Mourinho era. This was a reminder of days gone by, taking those familiar with his career back to his goal for England in this stadium when he rose into the night sky to head home a David Beckham cross against Brazil in 2007. Those days are a distant memory and even England manager Roy Hodgson, admiring this performance from the stands, accepts that Terry will never play for the national side again. Everybody has moved on, and rightly so. He has played at the highest level and yet he reached new heights here, leading his team up the Wembley staircase and leading the celebrations when he collected the trophy. Dressed head to toe in Chelsea’s blue strip, Terry wouldn’t have it any other way.","Chelsea beat Tottenham 2-0 in the Capital One Cup final .

Now they say the risk of a mega-quake is more likely than previously thought. The chance of a magnitude-8 quake striking the state in the next three decades jumped to 7 per cent from 4.7 per cent, mainly because scientists took into account the possibility that several faults can shake at once, releasing seismic energy that results in greater destruction. While the risk of a mega-quake is higher than past estimates, it's more likely - greater than 99 per cent chance - that California will be rattled by a magnitude-6.7 jolt similar in size to the 1994 Northridge disaster. Brace: A new U.S. Geological Survey report has increased the likelihood of a magnitude-8 earthquake hitting California over the next 30 years. Above, a photo of an overpass that collapsed in the 1994 magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake . The chance of a Northridge-size quake was slightly higher in Northern California than Southern California - 95 per cent versus 93 per cent, according to a report released Tuesday by the U.S. Geological Survey. 'California is earthquake country, and residents should live every day like it could be the day of a big one,' USGS geophysicist and lead author Ned Field said. The latest seismic calculations largely mirror previous findings issued by the USGS in 2008. Back then, scientists also determined that California faced an almost certain risk of experiencing a Northridge-size quake. The new report included newly discovered fault zones and the possibility that a quake can jump from fault to fault. Because of this knowledge, the odds of a catastrophic quake - magnitude 8 or larger - in the next 30 years increased. There is a 93 per cent chance of a magnitude 7 or larger occurring over the same period and a 48 per cent chance of a magnitude 7.5 - similar to previous estimates. Thousands of quakes every year hit California, sandwiched between two of Earth's major tectonic plates, the Pacific and North American plates. Most are too small to be felt. Of the more than 300 faults that crisscross the state, the southern segment of the San Andreas Fault - which runs from central California to the Salton Sea near the U.S.-Mexico border - remains the greatest threat because it hasn't ruptured in more than three centuries. The report found there is a 19 per cent chance in the next 30 years that a Northridge-size quake will unzip the southern section compared to a 6.4 per cent chance for the northern section, partly because it last broke in 1906. The southern San Andreas is 'ready to have an earthquake because it's really locked and loaded,' Field said. The report is a forecast, but it is not a prediction. Experts still cannot predict exactly where or when a quake will hit anywhere in the world. In recent years, the USGS and several universities have been testing an early warning system designed to detect the first waves of a jolt and send out an alert before the slower-moving damaging waves. Proponents have said a few seconds of notice can allow trains to slow down, utilities to shut off gas lines and people to duck for cover. The public alert system - still in pilot phrase - needs more funding before it can be rolled out statewide.","New U.S. Geological Survey report increases chances of magnitude-8 earthquake in next three decades to 7 per cent, up from 4.7 per cent .","- California faces increased likelihood of strong earthquake in next 30 years
- Chance of mega-quake (magnitude-8) occurring in California has risen to 7%
- Scientists consider possibility of multiple faults shaking at once, increasing destruction
- Northridge-size quake (magnitude-6.7) more likely - over 99% chance
- Northern California faces higher risk (95%) of Northridge-size quake compared to Southern California (93%)
- San Andreas Fault in Southern California poses greatest threat, hasn't ruptured in over 3 centuries
- Forecast indicates 19% chance of Northridge-size quake hitting southern San Andreas Fault in next 30 years
- USGS cannot predict exact location or timing of earthquakes
- Early warning system under testing to provide advance notice of earthquakes, needs more funding

The York-born tighthead qualifies for Wales through his grandmother, and he has proved an important part of Exeter's ongoing push for Aviva Premiership play-off status this season. And the 22-year-old has now been invited to train with the Wales squad by head coach Warren Gatland as they go into the final stages of their RBS 6 Nations campaign. Exeter tighthead prop Tomas Francis (top right) has been called up to train with the Wales squad . 'His scrummaging is outstanding, but he is also a skilful player as well,' Wales assistant coach and defence specialist Edwards said. 'Francis is a big kid, and I have seen him play. The scrum at Exeter has been going excellently recently, so we have brought him in. 'He is a young man who is coming from a great environment at Exeter which prides itself on hard work, and we would like to think we are a similar sort of environment. 'It's a case of trying to get the best players playing for us, and we see a lot of potential in this lad.' Francis, who weighs in at more than 20 stone, played Championship rugby for Doncaster and London Scottish before he was snapped up by Exeter, and he could easily push for a World Cup squad place with Wales later this year if he continues to impress. Wales coach Shaun Edwards says that Wales see 'a lot of potential' in uncapped Exeter prop Francis . Experienced Scarlets hooker Ken Owens, meanwhile, has been called into the Six Nations squad and reported for duty at Wales' training base on Monday. Wales, despite losing their opening Six Nations game to England, have given themselves a fighting chance of landing a third title in four years following successive away victories over Scotland and France. Reigning champions and unbeaten title favourites Ireland are next up in five days' time, and Edwards is under no illusion how big a task will be presented by Joe Schmidt's team. 'We have looked at our opponents, and we are coming up against the best team in Europe, the form team in Europe,' Edwards added. The 22-year-old was invited to train with the Wales squad by head coach Warren Gatland . 'They have got two brilliant half-backs, for a start, who have got great tactical brains. 'They have a strike-runner on the outside in Tommy Bowe who maybe the best defensive winger in the northern hemisphere. He is magnificent in picking up interceptions, and we have to keep our eye on Tommy. 'The forwards are well-drilled and a cohesive unit, and play with a lot of passion and aggression, and they have got excellent coaches. 'These are the big games you get excited about, and big-time players rise to the challenge.' Two key areas that Wales will need to perform strongly in are the lineout, where Ireland will be spearheaded by their captain Paul O'Connell, and shackling an impressive new Irish midfield combination of Jared Payne and Robbie Henshaw.

Maintain a brief, factual, and informative style.",4,"Sex advice was a lot more simple in the Eighties, says psychotherapist Philippa Perry in the BBC4 documentary Sex, Lies & Love Bites . The current generation of young people is the most confused about sex ever because of pornography, according to a psychotherapist. Philippa Perry, 57, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships. The mother-of-one added that the problem of young people not understanding the realities of sex is at least as bad now as it has ever been. An agony aunt for Red magazine and The Guardian, she said she comes across problems caused by pornography time and again and that men are increasingly turning to such columns for advice. The wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, 54, she said: ‘These days people educate themselves about sex usually by watching the freely available pornography. They get a skewed idea about sex, thinking women have to be one way and it’s all about submission and domination when of course it isn’t. ‘People get the wrong idea about sex and lose their way because of pornography. I’m not against pornography but it is not the most helpful of sex education tools. The danger these days is posed by people being exposed too young to a certain type of sex and then they tend to think that is what sex is.’ This naivety about the reality of sex is different to that of young people from previous generations who turned to agony aunts for advice. While it used to be driven by a lack of knowledge about sex, the problem is now that people are exposed to pornography, often depicting aggressive and violent sex, at too young of an age. She said ‘it’s worse now, but I’m an old person so I would say that.’ She highlighted one case that she encountered of a young man who was so addicted to pornography that he could no longer become aroused by women in real life. She said this is not the only time she has come across this problem and that ‘it’s a huge problem in society.’ Mrs Perry, who is also a trained psychotherapist, made the comments ahead of presenting a new documentary for BBC4, broadcasting tonight. Sex, Lies and Love Bites: The Agony Aunt Story interviews advice columnists, from Graham Norton to the women behind Jackie magazine’s Cathy and Claire, to looks at how these columns reflect society’s changing attitudes, especially towards sex. Perry, 57, wife of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry, has claimed that easy access to explicit videos and images has left many young people unable to have normal and healthy relationships . Gayle Anderson, who wrote the Jackie column between 1981 and 1982, said the internet has changed everything. She told Mrs Perry: ‘There was no social media [in the 1980s]. Now you would google a problem, we were the 80s Google really. They were basically sitting there waiting for puberty to hit, they didn’t know what was going to happen. They didn’t have sex education, mainly at schools.’ Sandy Monks, who filled the same role for two years from 1974, said she saw herself as the readers’ ‘big sister’ imparting advice. This is a different tone from some modern day advice columnists, such as Graham Norton, who answers readers’ queries for The Telegraph. He said people should not take the suggestions too seriously and oddly implied that women should expect men to cheat on them. Perry interviews Agony Aunts from publications such as Jackie and Red magazine for the BBC4 documentary, airing on Tuesday night at 9pm . He told the programme: ‘Agony aunts and uncles, across time immemorial, are not always right. You’re in an odd position, where you’re meddling in strangers’ lives and you’re judging a whole situation by one side, you don’t get the other side. ‘Women overthink men far too much and they think men are thinking when they are not, they are just doing. Most men get into trouble through their wallet or through their willy. ‘Women think that willies are more complicated creature than they are. So don’t feel too bad when it ends up somewhere else.’ One of the big changes Mrs Perry has noticed in her own column is how an increasing number of men are turning to her for help. She put this down to a crisis in male identity and men struggling to conform to traditional stereotypes. She said: ‘There is quite a lot of pressure on men to be a certain way and they have more difficulty being themselves. It may be that women have more permission to be a tomboy than a man has to be more androgynous.’","Psychotherapist Philippa Perry has made a documentary on sex advice .

American couple, Cheetah Platt and Rhiann Woodyard, have come up with the ultimate way to celebrate their love: by getting married in as many places around the world as they can in just under 90 days. The adventurous pair first came up with the globe-trotting plan after getting engaged last year - and finding themselves unable to come up with one specific theme or idea for the big day. Cheetah Platt (left) and Rhiann Woodyard (right), from Los Angeles, have decided to get married in 12 countries around the world . Their round the world adventure first began on February 8, when they packed two big backpacks and headed to Bogota, Colombia. During their three month journey, the couple hoped to visit 12 countries to have 38 wedding ceremonies in 83 days. Platt and Woodyard, who live in Los Angeles, admit that they did look for a traditional venue in their hometown, but nothing felt special and many they saw were simply outside of their price range. 'A lot of women spend a whole lot of time and stress and money on their one day and then it's over,' Woodyard told Buzzfeed. 'I love that I get to marry [Platt] over and over again. 'It's exciting that it's not just done in one day.' One of the couple's most recent stops? Egypt, where they tied the knot in front of an audience of camels and pyramids in the background . Platt and Woodyard first embarked on their round-the-world trip on February 8, flying to Bogota, Colombia . With the help of generous donors, Platt and Woodyard are scheduled to have 38 ceremonies in just 83 days . During their trip, the pair have decided to wear white at all times - and they will be married in the same outfits during each ceremony . One of the first few stops, the couple stopped in Spain for a beautiful ceremony amid the dramatic architecture . When they aren't officiating their stunning ceremonies, the couple takes in local experiences, like the Giraffe Center in Nairobi, Kenya . One of their favourite ceremonies took place in Mumbai, India. 'What a wonderful wedding!' Platt wrote. 'This ceremony meant so much.' With the help of honeymoon registry website, Honeyfund, the two were able to raise funds for this once in a lifetime journey. Posting the costs of the hotels they hoped to stay in and flights they hoped to take during their travels, Woodyard and Platt sourced the amounts needed to jet from the United States to Europe, Africa, Asia and everywhere in between, before returning to Los Angeles for a ceremony with friends and family in May. And forget paying for officiants in dozens of cities around the world, Woodyard and Platt were ordained online through the church of Spiritual Humanists so that they could marry each other. 'We're so excited for this once in a lifetime opportunity and we can't wait to make these dreams come true,' the pair wrote online. And the couple, who are both talented aerial performers, will also be using the experience as an opportunity to mix business with pleasure. 'We will be teaching, training and performing partner acrobatics all over the world,' they continued. 'It's such an incredible way for us to share our skills, our passion and our talents with others.' 'Wedding in front of the Roman aqueduct in Segovia, Spain,' Platt captioned this snap on Facebook. 'How did I get to be so lucky?!' The couple's second ceremony, also in Colombia, took place in the lush greenery for which the South American country is known . In Ireland, the pair had three ceremonies in one day! Here, they are standing in Glendalough Cathedral in the Wicklow Mountains . Passersby often snap photos of the couple, who usually take their own photographs afterwards showcasing their aerial skills . In between weddings, the pair carved out some time to take a stroll in one of Madrid's most famous parks . While in Africa, the couple got married again in a 'romantic Casablanca wedding,' which took place in the evening . The first wedding took place in Colombia. 'Many more to come,' Platt posted on Facebook. 'I have finally married the woman of my dreams!' Woodyard made her own bouquet - using dollar store flowers and old costume jewellery. 'She is amazing,' Platt captioned the photo. So far, Platt and Woodyard have visited Spain, Ireland, Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, India, and Thailand. Although they had originally hoped to be married on all seven continents, due to the cost associated with travelling to Antarctica, they opted to scrap that plan. With careful budgeting, the couple was able to to find 'round-the-world flights landing in 11 countries for less than $3,000 USD per person.' 'A lot of people say you should travel with the person you're going to marry,' Woodyard added. 'We get to learn about each other everyday more and more and I love that it's brought us close.' For those looking to follow the couple on their journey, they are posting photos and updates on Facebook.","The couple first began their trek on February 8, flying from Los Angeles, California to Bogota, Colombia .

A jilted lover sent his ex-girlfriend a threatening text message before breaking down her front door three minutes later and stabbing her friend in a jealous rage, a court has heard. Jason Taylor, 21, was allegedly convinced Jodie Emery, 26, was dating another man, telling her: ‘Last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there.’ Then he suddenly broke down the mother-of-two’s front door at her home in Preston, Lancashire - and, armed with a knife, began grappling with Adam Wilson, 25, who had been invited round for drinks, the court was told. Miss Emery - whose two young daughters were asleep upstairs - allegedly tried to stand between the pair in a bid to split them up, but Mr Wilson was left with a fatal thigh wound. The victim - who was barely known to meat factory worker Taylor - was taken to hospital but bled to death before doctors could save him. Preston Crown Court heard yesterday that the incident occurred on September 22 last year at 11pm - just two weeks after Taylor had split with Miss Emery after an eight-month relationship. The couple had earlier been on a summer caravan holiday in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, but on their return Taylor was said to have become upset when he discovered Miss Emery had terminated a pregnancy. Two days before the killing Taylor was at a local pub where he allegedly became so convinced Miss Emery was seeing someone else that he smashed a window and tried to punch a man who had once dated her. He was also constantly texting and phoning Miss Emery and would go to her house and sit outside watching what was going on inside - and sometimes even look through the windows, the court was told. Louise Blackwell QC, prosecuting, said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery to say: ‘I miss you. Maybe in time you’ll want to try again’. Trial: Armed with a knife Jason Taylor (left), 21, began grappling with Adam Wilson (right), 25, the court heard . She asked him not to contact her, but later that evening he sent her another text saying: ‘Can I come for cuddles?’ Miss Emery responded: ‘you being weird then’ but he said: ‘I’m not, my head is just f*****’ and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during a previous holiday with Miss Emery. The court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with. She was said to have texted back: ‘On my own - I keep telling you’. But Taylor then allegedly said: ‘Last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there, last chance’. Emery replied ‘WTF’, and tried to call him three times with no response. Miss Blackwell added: ‘The defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel. Once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and Adam Wilson and spilled into the lounge. ‘Miss Emery was trying her best, obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at Adam Wilson but it did not stop. Ex-girlfriend: Two days before the killing Taylor was at a local pub where he allegedly became convinced Miss Emery (pictured above in Facebook photographs) was seeing someone else . ‘All three of them ended up on the sofa in the living room. Adam Wilson was on the bottom, Jodie had got herself between him and the defendant lay on top but she described the repeated blows being struck to Adam Wilson. ‘She did not initially realise there was a knife involved but after a period of time during which blows were being rained down, the defendant then stood up. 'At that stage she saw he was armed with that knife, a knife she had seen before which he has bought when they were on holiday in Scarborough.’ Taylor allegedly fled the scene and dumped the knife as Miss Emery rang for ambulance. Mr Wilson was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from the 6cm (2.3in) long and 7.5cm (3in)-deep fatal wound which was to the inner right thigh. There were also cut wounds to the back, buttocks and legs and abrasions that were consistent with a struggle, the court heard. When Taylor was arrested he allegedly said: ‘No, you are not serious are you? You are joking, he is dead? He attacked me - I have done nothing wrong’. 'Fed up': Miss Emery (right) said Taylor (left) would turn up at her home and she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages . The black-handled blood stained knife was later recovered and Taylor said he kept it for ‘his own protection’ because he had been threatened in the past. He was said to have told police he had gone to speak to Miss Emery because of the breakdown of the relationship and had ‘no idea’ that Mr Wilson was there. He claimed he was hit with a bottle and used the knife to defend himself. In a video interview Miss Emery said Mr Wilson was ‘just a friend’ whom she had known for a couple of months. She said Taylor would turn up at her home and she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages.

A Donna school security guard suspended for sending inappropriate texts to female students. A Waco band director who had sex with a high school girl in his music room. These are just three of the 74 cases of inappropriate sexual relations between educators and students that have been opened since September. The Texas Education Agency reported that, in the last three school years, there has been a 27 per cent increase in the number of student-teacher relationship investigations in the state. San Antonio teacher Marcus Revila was given 17 years in prison for producing child pornography with a 16-year-old student who he got pregnant. Lisa Zuniga avoided a long prison sentence because she was pregnant with the child of a 13-year-old student she had sexual relations with. There were 179 investigations during the 2013-14 school year, compared to 141 probes in the 2009-10 period, according to the Houston Chronicle. The surge of cases in Texas corresponds to a national rise. There were 781 reported alleged cases of sexual relationships between students and school employees, according to the Washington Post. Terry Abbott, a former chief of staff at the U.S. Department of Education, said that, on average, 15 new young people are reported to have been 'sexually victimized' by their teachers each week, he wrote in the Washington Post. Abbott's firm, Drive West Communications, has been tracking media reports of relationships between students and their educators. According to Abott, they found that Texas has the highest number in the country of teacher sexual misconduct cases. Abott believes social media services have made it easier for teachers to 'develop improper relationships with students out of sight of parents and principals,' he wrote in the piece. Brittni Colleps (left) was sentenced to five years in prison after she admitted to having sex with five 18-year-old students at her home. But the lawyer for Ashley Zehnder (right) is arguing that she did not commit a crime by having relations with a student because the age of consent in Texas is 17 . He believes Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have 'created an open gateway for inappropriate behavior'. Some states are already taking action. In New Jersey, teachers are not allowed to add students on Facebook without written approval from their principal. They can also only contact students electronically if its done through district computers. A relationship between biology teacher and cheerleading coach Ashley Zehnder, 24, and a boy on the school's squad came to light because of technology. Zehnder admitted to the relationship after the boy began showing a naked photograph she had sent him through Snapchat to fellow students at their Pasadena high school. The teacher's lawyer has argued that Zehnder did not commit a crime because the age of consent in Texas is 17. But some Texas teachers have been locked up for years after they were caught having sexual relationships with a student. Two Texas school districts have been rocked by multiple student-teacher relationships occurring just months apart, which included criminal justice teacher Carlo Andres Cordova and teacher Breanne Brown . San Antonio teacher Marcus Revila was given 17 years in prison without parole this year after he was charged with producing child pornography with a 16-year-old student he had relations with and is now pregnant with his child. And Kennedale teacher Brittni Colleps was sentenced to five years in prison after she admitted to having sex with five 18-year-old students at her home. But former teacher, Lisa Zuniga, was able to avoid a long prison sentence in 2003 because she was pregnant with the child of a 13-year-old student she had sexual relations with. A South Texas school district recently got hit with a federal lawsuit after three employees were found to have had sexual relationships with students, according to the San Antonio Express-News. One of those employees, criminal justice teacher Carlo Andres Cordova, was the son-in-law of the Donna district's superintendent and allegedly had sex with a female student in his classroom. And barely a month after a health sciences teacher at the Abilene Independent School District admitted to having sex with a student, the district was rocked by another incident in January. According to police, teacher Breanne Brown had sex with a 16-year-old student on 10 different occasions.","Texas Education Agency reported that there has been a 27 per cent increase in number of investigations in last three years .

The £40,000-a-week striker, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral. The 27-year-old player, who cost his club £12million, was criticised by fans who said the car was ‘undeserved’ and the timing of the photo was ‘really appalling’, after it began circulating three days before his team lost 4-0. Aventador: Steven Fletcher, who has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland, suffered a Twitter backlash after the photograph of him with the supercar on the driveway of his home went viral . Partner: Fletcher is pictured with his beauty queen girlfriend Rachel Monaghan, 22 . However, his agent Scott Fisher told the Daily Record that Fletcher had not put the image on Twitter - adding that it was the company who sold the supercar who posted the picture online. Mr Fisher said: ‘It wasn’t Steven that put the picture up. The company who were doing advertising on it done it. I don’t know what the problem is and what people are getting excited about.’ But Janet Rowan, from the Sunderland Supporters’ Association, said that ‘it was probably the straw that broke the camel’s back’ for low-income fans to see someone taking possession of such a car. She told the Daily Mirror: ‘We know footballers have these big flash cars. I just think the timing was really appalling and I can really understand the way that people have felt about this.’ The four-wheel drive Aventador, which sells for between £242,000 and £295,000, has a top speed of 217mph, will return 17.6mpg and can perform 0 to 62mph in 2.9 seconds. Seven goals in two seasons: Fletcher (left) vies for the ball with Aston Villa's Jores Okore (right) during his Sunderland side's 4-0 Premier League defeat at the Stadium of Light on March 14 . Comparisons: Birmingham fan Michael Jabbari quoted a message from parody account BBC Sporf in a tweet, which said: 'Steven Fletcher: two seasons, seven goals, one new Lamborghini Aventador' In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter: 'Steven Fletcher has a Lamborghini, the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever.' Jack Liddell added: 'Tell me how Steven Fletcher (a striker) can score seven goals in two seasons yet have earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental.' Fletcher began his career at Hibernian in 2004, before moving to Burnley for £3million in 2009, Wolverhampton Wanderers for £6.5million in 2010, and Sunderland for £12million in 2012. But while he scored 52 goals in five years for Hibernian, 12 in one year for Burnley and 24 in two years for Wolves, he has struggled for form at Sunderland since signing. Fletcher scored 11 goals in his first season for the Black Cats, but only netted three last term - and has managed four this campaign. He has also played 18 times for Scotland, scoring once. Unimpressed: In response to the photo, Sunderland fan JamesTheMackem posted on Twitter that it was 'the most undeserved Lambo for a football player, ever' Disbelief: One football fan, John Tough, said he 'can't get over the fact' that Fletcher is driving a Lamborghini . Mystified: Jack Liddell posted a similar comment, wondering how Fletcher has 'earned a Lamborghini Aventador and a Bentley Continental' Sunderland sacked boss Gus Poyet last week after the 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa, before his replacement Dick Advocaat led the team to a 1-0 defeat at West Ham United on Saturday. The club are now in 17th, one place and one point above the relegation zone, with their next fixture against Newcastle United in the 152nd Tyne-Wear derby this Sunday. Fletcher, who was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, spent his younger years at military bases as the son of soldier Kenny, before he died aged 38 after a battle with cancer. This occurred when Fletcher was just ten, which saw his mother Mary move them to Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, to be closer to her family. After he had left home, she moved to County Durham and has lived there with his stepfather Martin, a Sunderland fan, for more than a decade. Fletcher moved to a £670,000 five-bedroom home in County Durham with his beauty queen partner Rachel Monaghan, 22, in October 2013, and they live there with their daughter Darcy-Mae, one.","Steven Fletcher has scored just seven times in two years for Sunderland .

With decades of experience as one of the world's top supermodels, Heidi is well versed at showcasing designers wares. But the 41-year-old German beauty took exception to the palace being used as a backdrop in a photoshoot for items from her lingerie range. Scroll down for video . Grand designs: Heidi Klum was spotted promoting her new lingerie line, Heidi Klum Intimates, at London's Selfridges on Saturday . Fantastic voyage: The German beauty stepped out of a black cab, which promoted her line . The supermodel issued a Tweet questioning the decision to take photographs of models wearing items from her lingerie range outside Buckingham Palace . The models, wearing pastel coloured lacy underwear and suspenders, were seen striking a variety of poses on a cold March morning at the weekend. Writing on her Twitter account next to an image of the photograph,  Heidi said: 'Nearly fell off my chair when I saw this. Who did this??? Not me!!! #NotCool' Her Tweet has earned more than 11,000 'likes' from her legion of followers and been shared by fellow Twitter users 88 times. The mother-of-four is the star of her own underwear campaign and has been snapped showing off her ageless physique in the skimpy designs. And she displayed one item of the lingerie line at the UK  launch of Heidi Klum Intimates range at London's Selfridges last week. Her green bra was clearly visible under her black mesh sweater, which she teamed with a pair of skin-tight black leather trousers and suede pointy heels. Enjoy the view: The blonde beauty wore a black pea coat over a mesh sweater, which showed her green bra . In demand: Hordes of fans lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the statuesque stunner . With her golden locks parted in the centre and falling below her shoulders, the star arrived in a black cab emblazoned with the words 'Heidi Klum Intimates at Selfridges'. As fans gathered to watch her glamorous arrival, she stepped out wearing a smart black pea coat, which she later shed to show off her racy top. Heidi has been on a busy schedule, promoting the Bendon-made line - which she's now the face of following Elle Macpherson's departure - on Good Morning America in New York just a day before. She said on GMA about her new venture: '[Bendon] asked me to take over the reins and continue to design for them. Now it’s called the Heidi Klum Intimates line and I’m so excited because I’ve been doing lingerie and wearing lingerie for many, many years. 'So basically I kept most of the styles that women have loved for the last 25 years that Elle created, and now I give them different laces, different colours, and then I added on a few new styles that weren’t existing – racer backs or beautiful strapless bras. 'So I kind of added on and put my own twist to it, and it’s so much fun. It’s a great opportunity for me and I was very thankful for that.' Hell for leather: Heidi teamed her racy top with a pair of skin-tight black leather trousers and suede heels . Stepping in: Heidi recently became the face of the line following Elle Macpherson's October departure . Elle's  departure from the line, and Bendon, was announced in October. CEO Justin Davis-Rice said: 'Elle has been a great partner to Bendon, however it’s time to take the brand to even greater heights, and Heidi is perfectly positioned to do just that. According to Women's Wear Daily, 50-year-old Elle's three lines for Bendon - Macpherson Men, The Body and the Intimates range - are worth an estimated $150million and turn over around $750million a year. Bendon's CEO told the publication that he is expecting the brand to grow by at least $25million right away, with Heidi at the helm helping to up retail orders by 25 per cent. Fan favourite: The Project Runway star posed with a group of fans after treating them to her autograph . Strike a pose! Heidi also flashed her pearly whites as she posed for an endless stream of selfies . The supermodel, who has tried her hand at designing in the past, also discussed the shimmering silver gown she wore to the Vanity Fair Oscars after party last month, which featured sexy cut-outs revealing that she wasn't wearing any underwear. 'I wasn’t wearing much underwear with that dress,' Heidi laughed. 'This dress was my favourite dress of the show, that Donatella [Versace] created, and I just loved it. 'And as soon as I saw it walking down the runway I immediately emailed and I said, “Please, I want to put this dress on hold for the Oscars.” And they sent it to me and thankfully it fit and I loved it. I love it sparkly – I’m still a German at heart.' Tried and tested: Heidi said that she has kept most of the styles designed by Elle, adding her own twists . Shades of change: Among the changes Heidi has incorporated are different laces and colours . New era: Elle Macpherson oversaw three lines for Bendon before her October departure .","Mother-of-four angered by image of three scantily clad women .

Rarer -- and some would argue cuter-- than the panda, there are less than 1,000 of these teddy bear-like creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, says conservationist Li Weidong. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, in 1983 and named it after his hometown, Ili. Last July, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. ""I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,"" he told CNN. ""If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty."" In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. The mammal, only 20 centimeters long, lives on sloping bare rock faces and feeds on grasses at high elevations. Li says the pika's habitat has been affected by global warming. Due to rising temperatures, glaciers have receded and the altitude of permanent snow has risen in the Tianshan mountains, forcing the pikas to gradually retreat to mountain tops, Li said. Ili pikas were originally found at elevations between 3,200 to 3,400 meters, he said. Now they have retreated to elevations of 4,100 meters. ""They have nowhere else to retreat,"" he added. It's also a solitary animal and is not as vocal as other pika species, so if predators are near, Ili pikas are not able to alert each other, Li said. Disease may also be a factor in its decline. In 1983, when Li first came across the mammal, nobody knew what it was. Two years later, Li  found another two and it was declared a new species. In the decade following, Li and his colleagues conducted a number of studies, including a census at 14 different sites. However, in 1992, Li left Ili to work with Xinjiang Academy of Environmental Protection in the regional capital Urumqi. No studies were conducted on Ili pika in the following decade. No one saw the pika, either. In 2002 and 2003, Li,  with a team of volunteers, conducted a fresh census. Despite spending 37 days searching the mountains for the pikas on seven separate trips, they came up empty handed. However, by analyzing droppings and snow tracks, Li, along with Arizona State University biologist Andrew Smith, was able to conclude that the Ili pika population had seen a dramatic decline. Together they calculated that there might be 2,000 mature animals, down from 2,900 in the early 1990s. The research, published in 2005, recommended that the animal should be listed as endangered. In 2007, Li retired early to throw himself into searching for the pika. Last year, he organized a group of 20 volunteers to conduct another survey with infrared cameras. This time, on the second day of the field trip, they finally spotted a pika, who jumped and stepped over Li's feet while he was trying to photograph it. The volunteers dubbed it a ""magic rabbit."" They concluded that there were fewer than 1,000 Ili pikas, said Li. ""This tiny species could be extinct any time,"" he said. ""They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore."" Li funds the research with himself, along with donations and occasional grants from organizations like the World Wide Fund for Nature. He says he has spent more than $32,000 of his own money over the past three decades and he has to raise funds to pay for gas. But what upsets Li most isn't the lack of funding. It's the lack of official recognition for the Ili, and other pikas' plight. The Ili pika isn't included on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The Department for Wildlife and Forest Plants Protection, under the Ministry of Forestry, said it was in the process of updating the list but declined to give any further details. Li and his volunteers have been calling for the establishment of a nature reserve to help protect the animal. ""I'm almost 60, and soon I won't be able to climb the Tianshan Mountains,"" he said. ""So I really hope that an organization will have people study and protect the Ili Pika.""","There are less than 1000 Ili pikas in existence, says Li Weidong .

This is the result of an ongoing trend of declining birth among white Americans and a baby boom among immigrant groups, as well as a surge in immigration. By the year 2020, 50.2percent of all children in the US are expected to be non-white, according to the Census. By 2044, whites will be outnumbered by minorities. The Census study, released this week, predicts that by year 2060, nearly 20percent of the population will be foreign born - thanks to an influx of 64million new immigrants. Deadline: In less than five years, minority children will outnumber white ones. In 14 years after that, more than half of all Americans will be minorities . The US will add nearly 100million people to its population in the next 40 years. 64million will come from immgration and another 40million will be born to foreign-born mothers . The populations of Hispanics in the US will rise 114percent - from 55million in 2014 to 63.6million in 2060 - making up about 29percent of the population. And the number of non-Hispanic whites will actually likely to decline over the next 40 years - from 200million and 62percent of the population now to 182million and 44percent of the population in 2060. The number of people who identified themselves as only black will also decline about 8percent to about 59million. The number of Asian-Americans will also increase dramatically - even more than the Hispanic population - rising 128percent to 22million. The Census reporty also projects a massive surge in the portion of the population that's over age 65. By 2030, 20percent of that population will qualify for a senior discount. In 2033, there will be more Americans over age 65 than children - thanks to the aging Baby Boom generation. By year 2060, there will be 76 'dependents' - those over age 65 and drawing government benefits  or under 18 - for every 100 working-age Americans. Demographers estimate that by 2060, the population of the United States will increase by 98million - from 319million to 417million people. Even so, the overall population growth of the nation will slow considerably over the next 40 years - as immigrants and the children of immigrants reach higher incomes, their fertility rates will drop - like native-born whites have. Big change: This chart shows how the portion of whites in America will fall from 62percent to 44percent in the next 40 years . The portion of foreign-born residents will increase from 13percent now to nearly 20percent by year 2060 .

Ultra High Net Worth Individuals (UHNWIs) must have a net worth of more than $30 million to qualify for membership of the exclusive rich-list. According to a list of Australia's wealthiest people by BRW, Gina Rinehart, James Packer, Frank Lowy, Harry Triguboff and Anthony Pratt are among some of the country's richest citizens. Sydney has been listed as one of the world's fastest-growing cities for ultra-millionaires with 764 UHNWIs . Billionaire Gina Rinehart  recently listed her extravagant property in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Mosman . Rinehart has an estimated wealth of $20bn, Pratt and family's wealth is estimated at $7bn as is Packer's and Lowy's. Triguboff is thought to have a fortune of over $5bn. Sydney is home to most of Australia's wealth with 764 UHNWIs, followed by Melbourne at 456, Perth at 267, Brisbane at 249 while Auckland  sits at 557. The Knight Frank Wealth Report's annual Attitudes Survey found London remains the single biggest centre for global UHNWIs, followed by Tokyo, Singapore and New York. Still, Knight Frank's head of research and consulting, Matt Whitby, said that over the past 10 years, Australia has grabbed fourth spot in terms of countries with the greatest foreign inflows of High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs). 'Of these HNWIs, there were 1,734 UHNWIs living in Australia in 2014, that is, someone with a net worth of over US$30 million. Sydney currently accommodates almost half of these individuals, with the capital cities of Melbourne (26%), Perth (15%) and Brisbane (14%) taking up the balance. The report's Global Cities Survey expanded to 40 cities for the first time, collecting data from 108 major metropolitan centres to rank the UHNWI population numbers. Billionaires James Packer and Anthony Pratt are among the Australia's high-profile wealthiest residents . Harry Triguboff is the founder and managing director of closely-held Meriton Pty and Australia's biggest apartment developer . Sydney has the highest concentration of UHNWIs, and high-profile Australians have maintained their properties across the state. Billionaire Gina Rinehart, from Perth, recently listed her extravagant property in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Mosman. Rinehart's daughter Hope Welker and her husband Ryan previously lived in the stunning harbourside home before moving to New York in 2011.

Football Federation Australia (FFA) chairman Frank Lowy is reportedly living in one of Sydney's affluent suburbs of Point Piper with his family. The Wealth Report's annual Attitudes Survey studied cities where the wealthy congregate, work, invest, educated and spend their leisure time. 'One of the clear trends to emerge from the Global Capital Markets Survey results is the increasingly global nature of private investments,' the report said.

Poulter’s preparations for his final tournament before the Masters were hardly ideal. While driving home from the course on Wednesday, Joshua was being taken to a nearby hospital with what turned out to be a bout of pneumonia. It was past midnight before he was allowed home. ‘It was certainly something of a blessing that I had a late tee-time,’ said the Englishman, who posted five birdies in a round that left him just a stroke off the pace set by American Morgan Hoffman. Rory McIlroy  waits on the first green during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational  at Bay Hill Club . Ian Poulter hits his tee shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . Poulter’s in good form at present, and having thrown away a golden opportunity to win one event in Florida at the Honda Classic three weeks ago, will be keen to give himself a chance to atone at this venue where he finished third in 2013. ‘It was nice to get Joshua home on Wednesday night and my wife Katie is a trained nurse, so I knew he was in good hands when I left for the course this morning,’ he said. After 15 holes of his opening round, a small slice of history loomed for McIlroy, just three weeks shy of his attempt at a career grand slam at the Masters. The world number one was swinging so smoothly he had hit all 15 greens in regulation. Not once in any round in his PGA Tour career has he hit all 18. No-one had done so at Bay Hill since 1995. Poulter hits an approach shot on the 16th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy hits an approach shot on the first hole during the first round at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge . Next up was the easiest hole on the course, the par five 16th. Yet it was here the 25 year old contrived to undo all the good work that had gone before. As soon as his second shot left the club face he started laughing at himself in exasperated fashion. He knew what was coming next. The ball bounced on the bank at the front of the green and back into one of the course’s many water hazards. There ended any hope of hitting all 18 greens in regulation. At least on the positive side, there were obviously plenty of excellent blows in those first 15 holes, and the reason he was only two under par at the time was he couldn’t buy a putt, which wouldn’t have stressed him unduly given the shocking state of the Bay Hill greens. Suffice to say that they’re nearer to municipal course standards than Augusta’s. Poulter hits an approach shot on the 18th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy of Northern Ireland talks with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald on the fourth fairway in Orlando, Florida . At least McIlroy finished with a birdie for a 70, which hasn’t left him too far off the pace. ‘There were a lot of good signs out there and with this being my last event before Augusta it’s important to play well in the second round and get myself into contention at the weekend,’ he said. Elsewhere, Padraig Harrington’s welcome revival continued with a 68 which left him alongside such luminaries as world number three Henrik Stenson, Adam Scott and the Scot Martin Laird, a former winner of this event. When McIlroy made his way to the first tee at a shade before 1pm he must have been heartened by the enormous crowd that had gathered. McIlroy of Northern Ireland hits his second shot on the fourth hole during the first round . The entire length of the hole was lined several people deep and McIlroy gave them something to cheer with a couple of opening blows that gave him a good look at a birdie, with the putt coming up just short. The first three holes at Bay Hill represent one of the toughest starts of any course on the PGA tour but McIlroy looked in the mood as he registered three easy pars. A chance was wasted at the par five fourth but he got into red figures with a classy birdie at the signature hole. Poulter of England reacts to a missed putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round in Orlando . McIlroy of Northern Ireland hits his tee shot on the third hole during the  Arnold Palmer Invitational . The par five 6th winds its way around a lake for all of its 500 plus yards but it held no fears for the Northern Irishman as he played a marvellous long iron second to 20ft and two putted for a birdie. Another birdie followed at the short seventh but that was the last putt he holed until he got to the 18th. After that effort from 15ft dropped he disappeared for dinner with the tournament host. He couldn’t keep the smile off his face when someone brought it up. ‘It’s going to be a really special evening,’ he said. McIlroy waves as he walks off the first green during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . McIlroy of Northern Ireland and Rickie Fowler of the United States walk off the first tee during the first round .","Rory McIlroy was swinging so smoothly he hit all 15 greens in regulation .

Elliot Gornall, 32, a former teacher at  R.F. McMullen Elementary School, is found to have allegedly used a tiny spy camera hung inside a plastic hook on the wall of his classroom's bathroom, according to prosecutors. He had dozens of videos featuring 25 separate students on his personal computer which were taken by authorities during a drug raid at his home in November. Gornall faces 25 felony charges including 23 counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, as well as two counts of attempting the same crime. If convicted, he could face up to 184 years in prison, according to the Mansfield News Journal. Scroll down for video . Elliot Gornall, 32, a former kindergartner teacher at R.F. McMullen Elementary School, was found to have allegedly used a tiny spy camera hung inside a plastic hook on the wall of his classroom's bathroom, according to prosecutors (above a November 2014 photo of the teacher) He faces 25 felony charges including 23 counts of illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material or performance, and two counts of attempting the same crime. Gornall resigned from teaching in December after being arrested for felony drug possession (above Gornall talks to his attorney Andrew Hyde during his arraignment hearing in Ohio on December 23, 2014) He had worked in the district for four years following clean background checks and had been moved to the kindergarten classroom in 2014, according to officials. Gornall was arrested on Friday and is being held in the Ashland County Jail, according to The Columbus Dispatch. 'The thought that a previously trusted kindergarten teacher would take advantage of young children in this way is horrifying,' said Ashland County Prosecutor Chris Tunnell in a statement announcing the charges on Saturday. The former teacher was found to have not only filmed students in his homeroom but also kindergartners who came into his classroom for end-of-day activities, said district spokesman Matt Dole. 'He was well-liked by students, staff and parents,' said Annette Gorrell, principal at R.F. McMullen Elementary School. 'The betrayal is huge.' Gornall taught both second and third-grade students before moving to the kindergarten classroom, and there is no indication that anything happened with his previous students, who he had taught before August, said Annette Gorrell, principal at the school. Parents of the students learned of the incident on Saturday said they felt both betrayed and angry. 'First, it's anger. Then, you're upset. And then you just feel betrayed,' said John Carroll, a member of the school board and also a parent of a child who was videotaped. 'We feel so hurt that our child was violated in this way.' Gornall's computer was examined by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and videos were found dating back to around August 20 to mid-November (above an Gornall pictured in an undated photo) Gornall resigned from teaching last year after being arrested for felony drug possession. He was charged related to prescription-drug abuse and marijuana in December, along with a misdemeanor count of receiving stolen property when authorities said they discovered children's underwear while raiding his home in relation to the drug charges. He pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Investigators then confiscated his home computer and contacted the school. Gornall's computer was examined by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and videos were found dating back to around August 20 to mid-November, said Tunnell. 'We are responsible for every teacher and staff member who works here and when one of them breaks the law, we take it very seriously,' she said. Investigators said none of the videos were uploaded online or shared in any way, and there is no indication any students were physically abused or touched inappropriately (above file photo of RF McMullen Elementary School) Investigators said none of the videos were uploaded online or shared in any way, and there is no indication any students were physically abused or touched inappropriately. School officials said they do not plan to address their students about the allegations but will have counselors available, and a letter will go out to the district on Monday. 'The kindergartners are innocent,' said Gorrell. 'We are hoping that they don't have to hear about this.' Gornall was taken into custody on Friday and is expected in court on Monday.","Elliot Gornall, 32, was former teacher at RF McMullen Elementary School where he resigned from teaching last year following felony drug charges .

The police match commander in charge of Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989 has admitted that his failure to close a tunnel was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 fans at the Hillsborough disaster. During the inquest into the deaths today, David Duckenfield also admitted that he 'froze' on the day in question, while Paul Greaney QC suggested that a child of 'average intelligence' could have realised the consequences of opening a gate to relieve congestion. Up to 2,000 fans entered Hillsborough stadium's Gate C, with many heading straight for a tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed. They then continued to the already full central pens on the terrace which led to the fatal crushing. Mr Greaney reminded Mr Duckenfield of his earlier evidence to Christina Lambert QC, counsel for the inquest, about his state of mind after the opening of Gate C when he told her: 'It was a momentous decision and your decision is such that you do not think of the next step. My mind for a moment went blank.' Asked again if he 'froze', Mr Duckenfield said: 'It appears to be a distinct possibility.' Mr Greaney said: 'You know what was in your mind and I will ask just one last time. Will you accept that in fact you froze?' Mr Duckenfield responded: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney went on: 'Do you agree with the following, that people died in a crush in the central pens?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That if they had not been permitted to flow down the tunnel into those central pens that would not have occurred?' The witness repeated: 'Yes sir.' Liverpool supporters were crushed to death during an FA Cup semi-final with Nottingham Forest in 1989 . Liverpool supporters and family members of the victims of the disaster have long sought justice . The barrister continued: 'That closing the tunnel would have prevented that and therefore would have prevented the tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said again: 'Yes sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'That you failed to recognise that there was a need to close that tunnel.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I did fail to recognise that sir.' Mr Greaney said: 'And therefore failed to take steps to achieve that.' Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did sir.' A young Liverpool fan is carried away from the danger as supporters are forced on to the Hillsborough pitch . Mr Greaney said: 'That failure was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 persons in the Hillsborough tragedy.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes sir.' Earlier Mr Duckenfield had claimed he was unaware of the geography of Sheffield Wednesday's ground, this being his first match in charge, and denied that he 'bottled it'. Mr Greaney, representing the Police Federation, put it the retired police chief: 'Do you agree that never mind a competent match commander it might only take a child of average intelligence to realise what the consequences of your actions might be?' Thousands of Liverpool fans hold up scarves during a Hillsborough memorial service at Anfield last year . Mr Duckenfield replied: 'I did not think of it on the day, sir, because of the pressure I was under.' Mr Greaney asked: 'Is the explanation of your failures Mr Duckenfield not that you were ignorant of the geography for example but rather that you knew the geography, you knew what the consequences might be of people entering the crowd but you simply froze?' The witness replied: 'I am not in a position to make that judgment, sir. Others should make that judgment.' Mr Greaney continued: 'You bottled it. You panicked and you failed to take the action that you knew needed to be taken to avoid consequences that you had foreseen. Now does that describe your state at the time?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I disagree with you sir.' A shirt of local rivals Everton is among thousands of flower tributes laid at Anfield shortly after the disaster . 'Why?' asked Mr Greaney. Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because that's my view.' The barrister said: 'Why is it your view?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Because it is my view and there can be no other view than mine.' Mr Greaney said: 'Do you accept that might thought to be a rather arrogant thing to say?' The witness replied: 'Sir I apologise. If that appears arrogant I didn't mean that to be so.' The inquests have heard that Mr Duckenfield told the 1989 Taylor Inquiry into the disaster that he had made the right decisions on the day but he now accepted that he had made errors - some of which were 'grave'. Chair of the Hillsborough Families For Justice, Margaret Aspinall, arrives at the inquest last week . He has told the jury that his serious failings were due to his lack of experience and that others also played their part in the cause of the deaths. Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Greaney that it was 'totally unacceptable' that a match commander 'did not have a grip on the geography of that ground sufficient to enable you to understand the consequences of your decision making'. He also accepted that when giving evidence to Lord Justice Taylor it appeared that he was aware that the congested Leppings Lane turnstiles did lead to the central tunnel. Mr Duckenfield said he did not want to go into detail about his 'personal circumstances' - he has previously said he suffered post-traumatic stress - but it may have been he was 'confused' when giving evidence in 1989. Supporters pay their respects to the deceased at the Anfield gates in Liverpool after the disaster in 1989 . Mr Greaney said: 'The other possibility that I put to you is that you did at the time know much more about the geography of that ground and you are seeking to conceal that knowledge from this jury.' Mr Duckenfield said: 'I can assure you, sir, I had no idea where fans would go from A to G (turnstiles) or the opening of Gate C.' Mr Greaney pointed out that Mr Duckenfield could have looked at a plan of the ground layout in the police control box before opening the gate at 2.52pm and that he could have consulted a fellow senior colleague with greater experience of the ground. A memorial service is held at Liverpool's Anfield ground on the April 15, 1989 anniversary of the disaster . The barrister told the court that another officer who was in the control box, who was operating the CCTV cameras, had earlier told the jury that he thought Mr Duckenfield was 'not a leader in that control room during that critical period'. Mr Greaney asked Mr Duckenfield: 'Do you agree that (the officer) was describing a match commander who had frozen?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'It is a possibility, sir, but that is his view and I cannot comment further.' Mr Greaney said: 'Can you not tell us whether on that day in that situation you simply froze?' The witness replied: 'Sir, I think it is fair to say that we were all in a state of shock.' Duckenfield agreed with Greaney that it would be 'disgraceful' and 'cowardly' to shift blame for his failings . Mr Greaney said: 'You were the one whose job it was to get past any feelings of shock, do you agree?' Mr Duckenfield said: 'Yes, sir, but I am human.' Mr Greaney said: 'Do you agree that you failed to offer any true leadership in that situation on that day?' The witness replied: 'That is not my view.' Earlier, Mr Duckenfield agreed with Mr Greaney that it would be 'disgraceful' and 'cowardly' to try to shift blame for his own failings to officers under his own command. The retired chief superintendent of South Yorkshire Police has previously said he had expected police officers on the perimeter track of the ground and those in the West Stand overlooking the Leppings Lane terrace pens to have kept an eye on monitoring the filling of them. But he accepted they had no received formal instructions to do so. The Hillsborough Memorial at Anfield has been relocated during the redevelopment work on the stadium .

Dressed in skinny jeans, a gray t-shirt and black heels, Danica Weeks welcomes us inside her family home. Her warm smile and sparkly green eyes briefly disguise the deep-seated grief and sadness that constantly envelops her. The mother of two young boys can't move on. Her life is stuck on March 7, 2014, when she kissed her husband Paul goodbye at Perth International Airport. He was heading to Mongolia, where he would begin work as a mechanical engineer at one of the mines. It was a big job with enormous opportunity that could set up his young family. Unable to wear jewelry at the work site, he gave Danica his wedding band saying that if anything was to happen to him, she should give the ring to the first son that marries. Wearing it on a simple chain around her neck, she touches it as she speaks. ""I'm so glad that happened, that I've got this for the boys,"" she said. ""And for me, because I may never get anything. It may be the only piece of him that I have that is so close to us."" Paul Weeks, 39, left Perth that day and flew to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for his flight on to Beijing. Just after midnight on March 8, he boarded Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Weeks had no idea about the plane's disappearance until she got a call from a news reporter asking if her husband was on board the missing Boeing 777. ""My life stopped that day, so that's what I remember. I'm purely now just existing. People say you're coping. I wouldn't call it coping; it's existing."" She has yet to tell her eldest son Lincoln, 4, that his father whom he adored will never come home. She can't make sense of it herself. How is a 4-year-old going to understand? She tells him Daddy is working in Mongolia -- the truth is just too painful. ""You create your own scenarios in your head and you can't bear to think that someone -- your best friend, amazing husband, the father of my children -- went through any of that. I don't want that for him. It's the not knowing that really destroys you."" The past 12 months have been a roller coaster of emotions for Weeks. Initially she thought the plane had crashed but when no debris appeared she clung on to hope. When the ""pings"" were discovered and authorities believed they would find the black boxes within days, she was told to prepare for her husband's memorial service. When that turned out to be wrong, her heart sank once again. Now there are days when her grief paralyzes her and she can't get out of bed. There are other days when she affords herself the small luxury of daydreaming and imagines him walking in the front door. ""When I'm alone and I think 'what if he comes back?' I see our wedding pictures and I think if he was to come back it would be amazing (for me) and for the kids. Jack has grown so much -- he was 11 months when Paul left. We're coming up to his second birthday. ""We've gone through all the 12 months of special days and I look at Jack and he's the spitting image of Paul. He would be blown away by how much he's grown. He should be here seeing all of that and the reason we don't know why is so painful. ""I can't even explain the pain -- it's unbearable."" We discuss the current search underway in the southern Indian Ocean more than 1,000 miles from where we are sitting in her home. Weeks looks deflated -- she's physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. ""They're very optimistic about this latest search. I can't share in that anymore. I've thrown my emotions and hopes into so many other searches. It's too much for me now. I won't come back. Half of my soul was on that plane with Paul and now nearly a year on ... I don't think I will ever find myself again."" Week's eyes well up with tears as she talks about her husband whom she met at the Munich Beer Festival 15 years ago. Since then, they had been inseparable --  until now. Her greatest fear is if nothing is found in the 60,000 square kilometer priority search area -- due to be completed by May - the authorities will call off the search operation. No country has said this but it doesn't stop Danica from thinking it. ""You know, that's so unfair -- where does that leave us? We can't move on beyond MH370. They may be able to but they don't come home to an empty house and 2 young children that should have their father here. They (the Malaysians) are legally and morally committed to bringing them all home and that's what they should do"". When asked what she'll be doing on March 8 -- one year since MH370 disappeared and since she last saw Paul -- tears stream down her face. ""Probably crying a lot. I never thought we'd reach a year and not know. You go through every anniversary, Lincoln's birthday, Paul's birthday, Christmas. You think we'll know by then and it's a year on."" While her loss and pain is palpable, there is an incredible strength within Weeks. She has to remain strong, she says, for the sake of her boys. ""I will keep searching. I will never stop searching for him. He gave everything to us. He is amazing. I know that if the shoe was on the other foot, he wouldn't stop looking for me. ""And I will never stop looking for him either.""","Danica Weeks is raising her two young sons without her husband, who was aboard MH370 .

The most populous nation on the planet is in the process of producing a series of textbooks for children aimed at teaching them how to play the beautiful game. Football-mad president Xi Jinping has already made the sport a compulsory part of the national curriculum for schoolchildren, with the aim of turning his country into a football powerhouse. Xi Jinping kicks a football during a 2012 visit to Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland, when he was China's vice president. The football-mad leader wants to make set his country on the road to being world champions . Thirty football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' Young players, teachers and coaches will be able to access online football tutorials linked to the books . 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books', says the man in charge of their creation Chen Keqi . Xi Jinping has been a football fan since he played for his school team and is said to be very keen to see his country climb the world rankings . And now China's young players will hopefully have everything they need to become future World Cup winners thanks to the new tools at their disposal. According to the Chinese People's Daily, the first series of football textbooks for students in primary and secondary school will be completed at the end of this month by the People's Education Press (PEP). Chen Keqi, director of the Sports Office at the PEP, says 30 football 'experts' are involved in the drafting of the books, including 'football education specialists' and primary and secondary school PE teachers. The texts feature tips on individual skills such as ball striking, dribbling and passing, but also place great stress on teamwork in order to 'cultivate students' will and character'. Mr Keqi said, 'Given the nature of this sport, the textbooks will highlight students' awareness of teamwork and cooperation. It is hoped the 3D young footballers will encourage China's budding players to become world beaters . Pupils will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps . 'It will aim to cultivate their hard-working and optimistic spirit. All that reflects the educational value of football. 'We aim to improve students’ overall ability and make them well-developed both in mind and body. 'Students’ awareness of duty and responsibility can be raised in this process of learning.' 'Any type of education must take building people’s characters and passing knowledge on to students into account, and PE education is no exception.' There are seven volumes of textbooks, four of which will be for primary, middle school and first year high school students, while the remaining three are teaching guides for primary and secondary school coaches. Pupils from primary grades 3-4 will be taught basic skills including 'balancing on a ball' and doing 'keepy-uppy' with their insteps, while students from secondary grades 5-6 will be learning some more 'complex' skills such as keeping a ball in the air using different parts of their feet. The books feature 3D pictures to help teach positional play and develop 'attacking strategy'. China's men's team. For a country of 1.37billion people their ranking of 82 does not sit well with Chinese fans . China's men take on Uruguay at the Wuhan Sports Center Stadium in October 2010. President Xi wants the country to qualify for a World Cup again, like they did in 2002, and eventually win the competition . They also have green QR codes which readers can scan with their mobile phones to access online football tutorial videos. Mr Keqi said: '3D technology brought football skills to life and graphics can be easily understood by students. 'We paid particular attention on gender ratio when we did the 3D pictures for the textbooks because we didn't want to let male players dominate the books. 'In addition to publishing paper textbooks, we will introduce CD and online video tutorials to help teachers learn more about the sport. 'We will organise some training if possible to ensure teachers are best able to use the set of textbooks.' Prince William meets Mr Xi at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing earlier this month. The Aston Villa fan mentioned the Chinese president's love of football during their talk . Mr Xi is a massive fan of the beautiful game and he and many of his 1.37billion countryman are said to be ashamed at the lowly number 82 ranking of the Chinese men's national team. He dreams his country will again qualify for a World Cup – they last did so in 2002 but went out after failing to score – will have the opportunity to host the tournament and, most optimistically, will one day win it. At least China's women's team has a much better chance of doing that any time soon as they are currently ranked a much more respectable 13th in the world. On his recent visit to China Prince William bonded with Mr Xi over their mutual love of the round ball game. William, who is an Aston Villa fan, told the president: 'I also gather you're quite a football fan. I'm looking forward to learning about China's football'.","Xi Jinping wants to make country of 1.37billion into a football powerhouse .

The finger ring found in a 9th century Swedish grave is inscribed with Arabic Kufic writing. The letters appear to read ""AL_LLH, researchers say, which they interpret as meaning ""for/to (the approval of) Allah."" In a paper published in the journal Scanning, the researchers say it is the only ring with an Arabic inscription ever found at a Scandinavian archaeological site. The object was originally discovered during a late 19th century grave excavation in the town of Birka, on Björkö island, about 19 miles (30 kilometers) from Stockholm. Birka was a key trading center during the Viking age and made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993. The ring is part of the Swedish History Museum's collection, originally cataloged as being made of gilded silver and violet amethyst, bearing the inscription ""Allah."" Researchers led by Stockholm University biophysicist Sebastian Wärmländer say they used ""scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to analyze the ring's composition and found that it was in fact made of silver alloy and the ""amethyst"" was colored glass. ""For the stone, we must remember that even though colored glass might today be perceived as a 'fake' material of lower value, this was not necessarily so in the past,"" the team cautioned. ""Even though glass production began around 5,000 years ago in the Levant it was still an exotic material in Viking Age Scandinavia."" More significantly, the researchers found no trace of the gold that had been assumed to coat the ring and noted the presence of filing marks. ""Together with the absence of gold on the metal surface ... the file marks clearly show that the previous description of the ring as gilded was mistaken: if the surface had been gilt and the gold layer had worn away, also the file markings would be gone. But the metal surface displays no wear, and as the original file marks are still in place, this ring has never been much used."" The team, therefore, believes the ring was passed from an Arabic silversmith to the woman, with few or any other owners in between. While imported coins were also found in the grave -- many from Afghanistan -- they were ""usually worn and torn ... from passing many hands along the established trade routes"" researchers said. The owner of the ring was found wearing traditional Scandinavian clothing, but the researchers said it was impossible to determine her ethnicity due to the decomposed state of the bones in the grave. ""It is not impossible that the woman herself, or someone close to her, might have visited -- or even originate from -- the Caliphate (which then stretched from Tunisia to the borders of India) or its surrounding regions,"" they said. While travel between the Islamic caliphate and the Viking world was recorded in ancient texts, tales of such journeys often included references to ""giants and dragons"" making it hard to tell fact from fiction, the researchers said. ""The importance of the studied Birka ring is that it most eloquently corroborates ancient tales about direct contacts between Viking Age Scandinavia and the Islamic world. Such contacts must have facilitated exchange of goods, culture, ideas, and news much more efficiently than indirect trade involving several merchants in-between,"" they concluded. Modern relationship . This new evidence of ancient ties between the Vikings and the caliphate comes at a time when Sweden's relationship with the modern Islamic world seems to be problematic. The country's foreign minister, Margot Wallstrom, has recently come under scrutiny after criticizing human rights in Saudi Arabia. In January, she tweeted that the flogging of blogger Raif Badawi was ""a cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression,"" which needed to be stopped. Saudi Arabia blocked Wallstrom from giving a speech to the Arab League in Cairo on March 9, in which she planned to refer to human rights and the rights of women. Sweden subsequently announced that it would not renew its memorandum of understanding with Saudi Arabia on military cooperation -- and in turn Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates withdrew their ambassadors to Sweden. The United Arab Emirates said it had summoned Sweden's ambassador to protest ""the abusive remarks by the Foreign Minister of Sweden, Margot Wallstrom, against Saudi Arabia.""","Swedish researchers have used scanning to examine a ring found in a Viking grave .
The ring carries an Arabic inscription thought to be ""for/to (the approval of) Allah, they say .
Their analysis suggests the ring was little worn, meaning trade ties could have been close .","- An ancient ring with Arabic inscriptions found in a 9th century Swedish grave in Birka.

More than 250 kitchens require major or urgent improvement after being rated one-star or lower, the standard of hygiene usually associated with the worst kebab vans. It raises fears that patients, children and the elderly risk illness from meals served by public service kitchens and sparks calls for urgent action to address the problem. More than 250 kitchens require major or urgent improvement after being rated one-star or lower, the standard of hygiene usually associated with the worst kebab vans . Under the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, establishments preparing and serving food are given a star rating for hygiene. Public health minister Jane Ellison said it 'provides transparency to consumers on hygiene standards in places where they eat or buy food'. The best rated sites are given five stars and a named 'very good'. Four stars awarded for 'good' levels of hygiene, and three stars for being 'generally satisfactory'. However, two stars mean improvement is required, one star means 'major improvement required' and zero stars suggests 'urgent action required'. According to figures released in Parliament, more than 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been given two or fewer stars. The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food' It includes 242 given two stars, 255 one star and six given no stars at all. A further 1,467 are only 'generally satisfactory'. The ratings are awarded by council inspectors. Luciana Berger, Labour's shadow public health minister, said: 'It is not acceptable that over 500 hospitals, childcare and caring premises have been told to improve their food hygiene. 'Everyone using these public services should have the right to expect food that has been prepared safely, in a clean environment. 'The Government must hold these premises to account on the urgent action they must now take to address these serious failings in standards.'

The Food Standards Agency says its ratings scheme 'will help you choose where to eat out or shop for food by giving you information about the hygiene standards in restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, hotels, and other places you eat out'. But people admitted to hospital will not have the same degree of choice, and most will be forced to eat the meals served or rely on friends and family to boy food from outside. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'These figures show 98.6 per cent of kitchens in hospitals and care facilities are performing well – the second highest number of all industries in the UK. However there are a small number that need to improve and we expect local services to take strong action on this.' At the inspection, the officer will check: . * how hygienically the food is handled – how it is prepared, cooked, re-heated, cooled and stored . * the condition of the structure of the buildings – the cleanliness, layout, lighting, ventilation and other facilities . * how the business manages what it does to make sure food is safe and so that the officer can be confident standards will be maintained in the future . The hygiene standards found at the time of inspection are then rated on a scale. At the bottom of the scale is '0' – this means urgent improvement is required. At the top of the scale is '5' – this means the hygiene standards are very good. Source: food.gov.uk .","EXCLUSIVE: Patients and elderly risk illness from public service kitchens .

The stamp by Steven Gerrard against Manchester United was no more than a petulant irritant which threatened no real damage but he was rightly sent off and roundly castigated by football at large. The rugby snobs are fond of saying that that football is a game for gentlemen played by thugs. Not so when seen in the context of Mr Gerrard’s words of contrition for a rare blood-rush late in his honourable career. England lock Courtney Lawes made a bonecrunching hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson . Lawes crumples Plisson in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the French fly half . Steven Gerrard stamped on Ander Herrera's right leg shortly after coming on at the start of the second half . Gerrard walks off the Anfield pitch in what was his last appearance against Man United in a Liverpool shirt . Jeff Powell’s piece has provoked much debate, including the above tweet from Lawes himself... They also like to say that rugby is a game for thugs played by gentlemen. Not with the malevolent Mr Lawes around. Gerrard sought forgiveness from his team-mates and fans for how his stupidity left it impossible for Liverpool to avoid Sunday’s critical Premier League defeat. There has been no apology from Lawes for a violent act 24 hours earlier which cast a pall over an otherwise heroic England victory, which came close to snatching an improbable Six Nations Championship. The general reaction at Anfield was concern that an idol may have dented his legacy a little in one of his last big matches in this country. At Twickenham even the low-swinging charioteers gasped in horror as Lawes came close to cutting in two French fly half Jules Plisson. Lawes has talked in the past about the beneficial impact for his teams of ‘the big hit.’ That offers a disturbing insight into his view of sport and the spirit in which it should be played. Perhaps he feels no need to explain himself this week because so many others were only too eager to do it for him. Referee Nigel Owens and his video-reviewing assistant agreed that the Lawes’ tackle was within the regulations. A livid Yoann Maestri pushed Lawes in the face and grapples with the England man following his challenge . Lawes and Maestri continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over . The majority of the rugby fraternity gave vent to their customary splutterings about this being ‘a man’s game.’ Not when you blind-side an opponent after he has passed the ball. The officials and the executives who are responsible for rugby were of a consensus that Lawes was already committed to the tackle so therefore he was not late enough to justify a red card. But did he really have to go through with it at such ferocious velocity? Was it vindictive or mere happenstance? Lawes is not telling us but if it had happened in a street outside the stadium police may well have been called to investigate if there were grounds for an assault charge. The rugby authorities – with the exception of the French who are asking for the on-the-spot not guilty verdict to be reviewed – are saying he did nothing wrong. Well, if that tackle was lawful then it explains why so many parents are discouraging their kids from playing this game. Herrera gestures and points at Gerrard as the Liverpool midfielder reacts following the challenge . Gerrard looks dejected after seeing red just 38 seconds after coming on for Liverpool at Anfield . If it is OK for a young man of average build like Plisson to be hit so hard by a giant that his head is shaken around like that of a rag doll before slamming against the ground, then what chance the campaign we at Sportsmail are leading for the reforms needed to prevent concussive head injuries? If the supply of youngsters dries up, rugby’s future will be bleak indeed. As for Lawes, he has past form. England internationals Charlie Hodgson and Owen Farrell and another French cap, Morgan Parra, are among a lengthening list of creative fly-halves who have been hammered – and in some cases injured – by trade-mark batterings from Lawes. The video of his brain-rattling of Plisson has gone viral and there is a danger of his hits becoming cult viewing. Now this is a contact game. The physical element is fundamental, while the strength and courage of the combatants are very much part of its appeal. But there has to be a limit. This is sport, not war. Football has a lot to learn from rugby about acceptance of decisions and respect for referees. But education is a two-way street. Come the crunches, football officials can take into account not only the force of the impact but the intent. Plisson continued to play after his mauling by Lawes and comes up against Luther Burrell here . England and France captains Chris Robshaw and Thierry Dusautoir listen to referee Nigel Owens . Was Lawes well-intentioned towards Plisson, who played even more poorly thereafter although going beyond the call of duty in carrying on? As the decision to let Lawes remain on the pitch came down he gave me the smug impression of someone who had got away with another one. No doubt it is asking too much for England to leave out the man they call their Enforcer. But they could come to regret not taking that decision if he does something similar in the World Cup later this year, the officials are less forgiving and they find themselves down to 14 men against the All Blacks. As power becomes ever more important than flair in rugby, so big men like Lawes bulk up even more muscle. And his own team-mates talk with increasing awe of how he targets the fly-halves he dwarfs. Legal or not Mr Lawes, try picking on someone your own size. Gareth Bale is reportedly determined to confound his enemies in Spain, win over his critics at Madrid and go on to prove himself a Real Galactico. All in preference to a £75 million transfer to Manchester United, Chelsea or Manchester City . Good for him. If he were to take even more money and run for home, it is unlikely greatness would ever become him. Gareth Bale is going through a fallow patch in his second year in the Spanish capital .","Lawes blind-sided the French fly half when the ball was gone .

For a change the teenagers had no problems doing their homework as they'd obviously been studying the notorious Ms Ashton for quite a while. 'The boys were swarming around me, and I could hear them mentioning my work name under their breath,' Ms Ashton told New Idea magazine. 'Unfortunately, they'd been online and obviously knew just who I was.' Scroll down for video . Madison Ashton (pictured here at court in 2012) lost her appeal against the estate of the late cardboard billionaire, Richard Pratt, in February . It was an experience that she worried would have a bad effect on her 13-year-old son Xavier, but she had no need to worry. 'I asked what was going on and he said a few boys had told him: ""Hey your Mum's a prostitute."" But he didn't take any notice,' she explained. 'He just went back to playing handball, because he thought they were d**kheads anyway. I was totally blown away by how brave and mature Xavier is.' Ms Ashton - who also has a 17-year-old daughter Indra - only tells Xavier that she goes to work and can't discuss it in detail because it involves adult services. The 40-year-old made it clear that she was always honest with her children about what she does and kept everything very 'matter-of-fact'. But considering her notoriety it's hard for her at times to stay out of the news. Last month she lost her appeal against the estate of billionaire Richard Pratt, who she said promised her millions. Ms Ashton launched an appeal against the 2012 decision to reject her bid for part of the cardboard king's estate. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress. Although the Supreme Court agreed the pair had the conversation, it found Ms Ashton's acceptance of $100,000 and the transfer of car into her name was done in full satisfaction of the trust claim. In November 2005, Ms Ashton signed a document from a employee of Mr Pratt's company, Visy Industries, that released Mr Pratt from any financial responsibility in exchange for a payment of $50,000 to the former mistress. Mr Pratt died in 2009. Billionaire Mr Pratt died in 2009 . Ms Ashton appeared before the Supreme Court of NSW in February but her case was dismissed . In appealing the decision, Ms Ashton sought a declaration that Mr Pratt's 2003 promises constituted a legally binding contract and anything she signed in November 2005 was void. She also sought damages from Mr Pratt's widdoe, Jeanne Pratt. But on Monday, the Court of Appeal dismissed her bid, saying the arrangement failed to spell out important terms such as Ms Ashton's obligations as mistress, how long it would last and the details of how the trusts would work. The court said Ms Ashton had received substantial gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress and there was nothing to suggest she was prevented from returning to the escort industry. Madison Ashton, who was once showered with gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress, claims the two of them were in a de-facto relationship, and it was not just a 'business' arrangement the pair had. Madison Ashton who was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as a hooker in 2003 after Pratt (right) promised her he would look after her and her two children . Ms Ashton, who also sued the cardboard baron's estate for $10 million in 2012 lost and racked up a million dollar legal bill. In September, The Daily Telegraph reported, the court heard Pratt had a 'voracious appetite' for young woman like Ms Ashton and that promising her five million dollars wouldn't have been very much money to such a wealthy man. Ms Ashton, who was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as an escort in 2003 after Mr Pratt promised he would look after her and her two children. It was reported she claimed to have given up a lucrative career in the high class escort business to become Mr Pratt's mistress . A book called 'Mistress: The True Stories of Mistresses and Their Men' released last year delved into the couples bizarre relationship. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress . The late Richard Pratt who was elected as Carlton's Football club's president Richard Pratt in 2007 was claimed to be in a de-facto relationship with prostitute Madison Ashton . Writer Matthew Benns and co-author Terry Smyth say Mr Pratt was one of Australia's business giants, but  it wasn't just wealth that pleased him. Rather, he had an 'apparently endless desire' for sex, Benns and Smyth wrote, sustaining two long-running affairs with a pair of young women from the bush. They were Shari-Lea Hitchcock, from Cambewarra, on the New South Wales south coast; and Peggy Jane Heslop - better known as Madison Ashton, sex worker and Penthouse Pet - who came from Wangaratta, in Victoria's north-east. Hitchcock was a 'blonde bombshell, 35 years his junior,' Benns and Smyth wrote. While Ashton was described as a canny brothel-owner with a troubled childhood.","Ms Ashton's had gone to see her 13-year-old son Xavier at his school .

An investigation by MPs found illegal immigrants heading for Britain are making it across the entire EU without a single border check. Ahead of the Easter getaway, the situation has become so severe lorries are being told not to stop within 125 miles of the port for fear of people trying to clamber aboard. MPs say that, as a result of greater lorry security, cars and motor homes are a prime target. Scroll down for video . Warning: As a result of greater lorry security, cars and motor homes are a prime target for illegal immigrants in Calais who are trying to enter the UK . In a report published today, the Commons home affairs committee says migrants trying to reach the ‘El Dorado’ of Britain are being caught at a rate of 100 a day.At the same time, the number gathering in squalid camps around Calais has almost doubled to 2,500 in the space of a few months. The committee found evidence of migrants who arrived in the EU via Turkey or Italy making their way to Calais without ‘encountering any border controls’. Its report, titled ‘Migration failures lead to a crisis in Calais’, blamed the Schengen Agreement allowing EU citizens to travel from one member state to another without passport checks. The UK opts out of the agreement, which Margaret Thatcher refused to sign 30 years ago to sneers from fellow European leaders. But even the French authorities have now declared Schengen a ‘failure’. Borders allowing access to the EU are not being properly policed, allowing tens of thousands of people from the likes of Somalia, Sudan, Eritrea and Syria to flood in via Italy, Greece and Turkey. Retired bank manager Sue Taber, 59. came through the Channel Tunnel without realising there was a stowaway illegal immigrant in the back of her car . Fabrice Leggeri, the executive director of European border agency Frontex, has warned that Libya alone has up to a million potential migrants ready to leave for the EU. The number massed at Calais has almost doubled since September from 1,300 to 2,500. Sir Charles Montgomery, director-general of the Home Office’s Border Force, said staff detected 30,180 attempts to enter the UK in the ten months to the end of January. This compared to 18,000 in the entire preceding year. Yet when caught, the migrants were handed over to the French who simply let them go. The MPs say: ‘We find it bizarre that there are thousands of attempts to enter the UK illegally through Calais, at great cost and inconvenience to business and leisure travellers, transport companies, and hauliers, and yet the people who are caught are simply released back into the French countryside.’ The Government is helping to fund more security fences around Calais. When she found an illegal immigrant hiding in the back seat of her Fiat Panda after driving home from France, Sue Taber couldn’t believe her eyes. Miss Taber thinks the man sneaked into her car when she left it briefly unlocked at Calais in September last year. Discovering him upon arrival in Kent, Miss Taber told the man ‘in no uncertain terms’ to ‘get lost’. She said at the time: ‘I’ve got a Fiat Panda for goodness sake, with two dogs in the back. 'And I’ve managed to get though passport control and everything else with a stowaway on board.’ But the report says there are fears that as security around freight traffic increases, migrants ‘will adapt to hiding in a wider variety of vehicles, including private cars or caravans’. The home affairs committee warns: ‘Schengen was intended to allow free movement, but not the free movement of illegal migrants. It was based on the assumption that the external border would be secure.’ Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The crisis in Calais is a direct result of the soft EU external border in the Southern Mediterranean and the Greek-Turkish border.’ The MPs also cast doubt on the Home Office’s ability to carry out new exit checks on everybody leaving the country from April 8. Ferry operators have warned the measure could create travel chaos for passengers and long queues. The MPs said they expected ministers to agree a series of exemptions – such as not checking the passports of British tourists leaving by coach. A Home Office spokesman said it had committed £12million to help reinforce security at Calais, ‘including installing security fencing and improving the flow of traffic to reduce the risk of queuing vehicles being targeted by migrants’.","Immigrants make it across the entire EU without a single border check .

Kane took just 79 seconds to make his mark on international football by scoring the final goal in England's 4-0 win over Lithuania at Wembley on Friday. The 21-year-old peeled away from his marker and nodded Raheem Sterling's cross in at the far post with just his third touch since coming off the bench. Harry Kane Wheels away after taking just 79 seconds to score his first international goal . The Spurs striker headed in at the far post from a Raheem Sterling cross shortly after coming at Wembley . Kane celebrates as England cruise to a 4-0 victory over lowly Lithunania on Friday night . England debutant's fastest goals: . Bill Nicholson                  19secs . John Cock                       30 . Harry Kane                     79 . After enjoying such a remarkable season with Tottenham, it did not come as a surprise that Kane made such a dramatic entrance to the international arena. The forward has now scored 30 goals so far this term and he was delighted to turn his boyhood dream into reality at Wembley. 'It's a dream come true. Obviously I was very excited to make my debut, and to score as well is what I dreamed of as a little kid,' Kane told Sky Sports News. 'It was a special night, a proud night, and one I won't be forgetting for a while.' Many goal-scoring debutants have seen their England careers quickly fizzle out into nothing. Francis Jeffers and David Nugent found the net on their first appearances and never played for their country again. Kieran Richardson took four minutes to break his international duck against the United States in 2005. He scored again 40 minutes later, but never started another game for the Three Lions. Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson will decide if Kane starts against Italy in their friendly on Tuesday . David Nugent scored a solitary goal against Andorra but was never selected for England again . Kieran Richardson scored twice against the USA in 2005, the last time he pulled on an England shirt . CLICK HERE to read how the Spurs striker fared on his Three Lions bow . Roy Hodgson believes Kane is here to stay, though, and the player himself is desperate to earn more caps. 'This is where I want to be, playing for England and scoring goals,' Kane said. 'It's my first taste of it and I loved it and hopefully I can keep doing well for club and country and see where it takes us.' Danny Welbeck's withdrawal through injury increased Kane's chances of starting against Italy in Turin. And the striker is ready to answer Hodgson's call if needed. 'That's down to the boss, but I'll be ready, raring to go if called upon. I will be looking forward to it,' Kane said. 'The lads have picked up some really good results home and away. We continued that against Lithuania and now we have a tough game coming up, but we are full of confidence.' If Hodgson brought Kane into the starting line-up, he would have to dispense with the 4-3-3 formation that worked so well against Lithuania, unless he started Wayne Rooney as one of the two wide-men alongside Kane. He is more likely to switch to a 4-4-2 diamond, with Kane and Rooney up front as a strike partnership. Kane's chances of facing Italy were raised after Danny Welbeck was forced to withdraw with injury . The Spurs striker could form a partnership with Wayne Rooney after replacing the captain on Friday . Hodgson was giving little away about team selection for Italy, but he accepts he will face increasing calls for Kane to start after his stunning debut. 'If I listened to clamour every time then a lot of players would be playing from the start in the next game,' said Hodgson, who has also released Raheem Sterling, James Milner and Leighton Baines from his squad. 'People come and go but I think Harry is here to stay. 'It could well happen (that Kane starts). We won't have Sterling and Welbeck so his chances increase all the time.' Hodgson was keen not to burden the youngster with even more pressure although he admits the forward's debut could not have gone any better. 'The word fairytale comes to mind and it's great when fairytales come true in this way,' Hodgson added. 'I'm delighted for him, he's had a good week in training and we've been quite excited to see him. 'But let's keep things in perspective, for him it's been a whirlwind romance for him in terms of playing top-class football and, if anything, I would like to try and relieve the pressure on him rather than heap pressure on him.' Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand (right) has been called up as cover for Kieran Gibbs . The 20 players left in the squad were given the rest of Saturday off after a morning warm-down session and team meeting. They will train again on Sunday, when Ryan Bertrand will join in after being called up as back-up for Kieran Gibbs. Seven of the 17 players left in the squad are yet to reach 10 caps, so Hodgson knows stretching England's winning streak to eight matches will be difficult. 'It will be an enormous test for the ones we put in because some of them won't have played in the national team for a long time and they are going to be playing against a top team, but we need a good squad going forward and we need competition for places,' Hodgson said.","Harry Kane scored on his England debut in 4-0 defeat of Lithuania .

Flores was presenting SportsCenter on Sunday evening when he made the wisecrack about Azalea while talking about her boyfriend, L.A. Lakers star Nick Young. A couple of weeks ago, 24-year-old Azalea had revealed that Young is terrified of dolphins because one once tried to kill him. Flores was presenting SportsCenter on Sunday evening when he made the wisecrack about Iggy Azalea while talking about her boyfriend, L.A. Lakers star Nick Young and his fear of dolphins . Basketball star Nick Young took to Twitter to express his anger at Flores for joking about his girlfriend . ‘We learned that, according to the Lakers’ Nick Young, a dolphin recently tried to kill him,’ said Flores during the What Did We Learn? segment of Sunday's show. ‘So, Nick, while dolphins are trying to kill you, your girlfriend is trying to kill hip-hop. Let’s call it even, okay?’ Azalea has remained quiet on the dis after quitting Twitter last month, but her boyfriend was far from amused at Flores' criticism. 'Your job is to talk about sports, not what me and my chick got going on,' he angrily tweeted. Young also appeared to threaten Flores, tweeting 'we got a problem' and 'I'm pretty sure we are going to run into each other soon.' Appearing on the Sedano and Stink radio show on Monday, Flores appeared to downplay any possible 'beef' between him and Young and said the joke was 'all in good fun.' The Australian pop star has been accused by a number of hip hop artists including Azealia Banks, Snoop Dogg, Q-Tip, Eve and soul singer Jill Scott of cultural appropriation . Flores however couldn't resist continuing the joke and said that he wasn't too worried about Young's apparent violent threat . 'If you look at his numbers, there is a 70 percent chance that — if he takes a shot at me — he’s going to miss. I’m just looking at the numbers, so I’m good.' As Azalea’s fame has grown, she has faced a growing wave of criticism – although up to now from hip hop artists – who have accused her of stealing from their culture and repackaging it for the mainstream. Before departing Twitter last month Azalea, whose real name is Amethyst Amelia Kelly, had become embroiled in various wars of words online with rival Azealia Banks as well as Snoop Dogg, Q-Tip, Eve and soul singer Jill Scott. Banks has accused Azalea of not caring about 'black issues'. 'Its funny to see people Like Igloo Australia silent when these things happen... Black Culture is cool, but black issues sure aren't huh?,’ she tweeted last year. The singer and boyfriend LA Laker Nick Young , seen at the UCLA Men's Basketball Game at The Galen Center in Los Angeles in January . Azalea rowed online with both Azealia Banks and Snoop Dogg before announcing that she was quitting Twitter last month . While Azalea accused Banks of having a bad attitude. She wrote: 'Special msg for banks: There are many black artists succeeding in all genres. The reason you haven't is because of your p**s poor attitude. Azalea has also rowed with Snoop Dog after he posted a picture on Instagram of a person with pale skin and cornrows, claiming it was a photograph of Iggy wearing no make-up. Snoop compared her to the two main characters from the film White Chicks naming the photo, 'White Chicks 2 starring Iggy'. She fought back comparing him to the type of guy that asks for your number and then says you are 'ugly when you say no'. Last month Azalea announced that she is taking a break from social media. 'I want you to know I am taking some time away from social media. I need to be happy and it is too negative and draining,' she told her followers. Minutes later she added: 'To become nasty because of the way I feel I am treated would be a disservice to my fans and I promise I will try to keep smiling.'

Her mother, the actress Marcheline Bertrand, died of ovarian cancer at the age of 56 in 2007. Her grandmother Lois Bertrand died of cancer aged 45 and her aunt Debbie - her mother's sister - lost her battle with the disease at 61. This strong family history comes from a mutation of the BRCA1 gene, which dramatically raises the risk of ovarian and breast cancer. Scroll down for video . Angelina revealed she's had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, after a preventative double mastectomy . To prevent herself following in the footsteps of her female relatives, Angelina last week revealed she's had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed (she had a 50 per cent risk of developing ovarian cancer). This comes two years after a preventative double mastectomy because of her raised risk of breast cancer. But while many people know that a greater risk of developing these cancers can be inherited, what is less well known is that it's not just down the female line; the risk can be passed on from your father's side of the family, too. Catherine Murley, a 44-year-old commercial manager from Rugby, inherited a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer from her father as result of a faulty BRCA1 gene. 'I never knew you could inherit a breast and ovarian cancer gene from a male relative,' she says. She only became aware of the faulty BRCA1 gene in her family tree last June, after suddenly hearing from her father Mike, 68, a retired teacher, after years of little contact. 'I received a text from my dad saying: ""Can we talk?"" ' she says. Her parents divorced when she was four and her mother brought her up with her sister Sinead, 40, and brother Andrew, 39. 'When I phoned my dad that evening, he explained that my cousin - his sister's daughter - had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and the family had found out she had the inherited faulty BRCA1 gene,' she says. Catherine Murley inherited the ovarian cancer gene from her father . 'My aunt - her mother - had died of ovarian cancer when she was in her 40s. After my cousin was diagnosed at the age of 40, the rest of that side of my dad's family went for genetic testing. 'That's when my dad was found to be positive for the faulty gene.' Catherine's father was told this meant he had a raised risk of prostate cancer and male breast cancer, and a slightly higher chance of pancreatic cancer. He was concerned that the faulty gene could have been passed to his children. 'I was aware of the BRCA1 connection because I had a close friend with it who died from breast cancer,' says Catherine. 'But I assumed it was something related to women and didn't know it could be passed by men, too.' It's a common misconception, says Dr Adam Rosenthal, a gynaecological oncologist at University College London Hospital. 'Unfortunately, many women and some doctors disregard the paternal side of the family. They don't recognise the importance of a pattern of cancers on their father's side, so denying themselves the opportunity for gene testing to clarify their level of risk.' We all inherit two copies of every gene - one from our mother and one from our father. So if either parent has a mutant copy, a child has a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it. Assuming it's just the mother's line that you need to worry about is an understandable mistake, says Dr Rosenthal, as these genes tend to cause female cancers. 'However, they are not passed down on the female sex chromosome, like some inherited diseases. Men carry them just as easily as women,' he says. 'But women are more vulnerable to the effects.' While a faulty BRCA gene raises a man's risk of prostate cancer to 10 to 25 per cent, they raise a woman's risk of ovarian cancer to 15 to 45 per cent, and the risk of breast cancer to 45 to 90 per cent. 'No one knows why the risk is higher in women, but it may relate to female hormones acting with the faulty gene to promote cancer,' says Dr Rosenthal, who is also consultant gynaecologist at Weymouth Street Hospital, London. He says it's crucial people are aware of any history of cancer in their family. 'Men need to be careful not to disregard their mother's side of the family in the same way women should not ignore their father's side,' he says. 'If you're in any doubt about the implications of a pattern of cancers in your family, discuss it with your GP. They can refer you for genetic testing.' After hearing the news from her father, Catherine contacted her brother and sister, warning them they needed to be checked. Her GP put her on a waiting list to have genetic testing. Her father had waited almost ten months to be tested, but Catherine didn't want to wait this long. 'I was 43, which felt quite old to find out you have faulty BRCA1,' she says. 'The thought of it kept me awake at night. My fear was that I might already have cancer - I knew ovarian cancer was notoriously hard to diagnose.' It led to the commercial manager having ovaries and fallopian tubes removed and having a mastectomy . Symptoms include persistent pelvic and stomach pain, bloating and nausea after eating, as well as feeling full quicker. Catherine paid £700 to have a test at a private screening clinic, which involved giving a blood sample. There are hundreds of different mutations of the BRCA1 gene, but as she knew which mutation she might have - as it would be the same one as her father - the laboratory was able to speed up its analysis. Three weeks later, Catherine went back with her husband Martyn to be told her test results. 'I had a bad feeling from the outset,' says Catherine. 'But when the gene counsellor said I had the defective gene, I began to cry. I knew from that moment that my life was on a different path. I texted my dad and family straight away with my news.' Catherine was told she was at equal risk of ovarian and breast cancer. But for reasons experts do not fully understand, in her family the mutant gene more commonly manifested itself as ovarian cancer in the female line and prostate cancer in men. Women with a faulty BRCA1 gene can have annual mammograms to screen for breast cancer or have a preventative mastectomy. There is no reliable way to screen for ovarian cancer. Catherine quickly decided what she wanted to do. 'My close friend who had the faulty BRCA gene relied solely on annual breast screening. She didn't make it. I wanted to take away any risk of getting either cancer through surgery while I still could.' In September, she underwent keyhole surgery to remove her ovaries and fallopian tubes - the operation was performed by Dr Rosenthal. Examination of the fallopian tubes revealed pre-cancerous cells. 'I felt it confirmed that I had made the right decision in pushing to have surgery as soon as possible,' says Catherine. 'No one could have said when the cells would have turned into something more serious.' Two months later, she underwent a double mastectomy, with surgeons using tissue from her stomach to form new breasts. The breast tissue was found to be clear of cancerous cells. A report published a few months ago in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute found more widespread genetic testing for cancer-causing mutations would save lives and reduce the amount spent on treating cancers. The Eve Appeal, the UK charity dedicated to gynaecological cancer research, is calling for all women diagnosed with ovarian cancer to be tested for faulty BRCA genes. Chief executive Athena Lamnisos says it would increase experts' understanding of these cancers and allow women to warn their family members, too. Though her brother is still waiting for genetic testing, Catherine's sister heard shortly before Christmas that she, too, has the defective gene. She will undergo the same surgery as Catherine. 'I have thanked my cousin for alerting us,' says Catherine. 'I've been able to take action to protect myself from cancer.' eveappeal.org.uk .","Catherine Murley, 44, from Rugby, inherited BRCA1 gene from her dad .

Lea Boyce can attest to that after she spent years going back and forth between hospital and home with her young daughter Sophie. When Sophie was only three-years-old she put her delicate hand on a running treadmill and it gave her a nasty friction burn which required years of medical attention. She was referred to the Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital to see a burns specialist but never expected to be treated by a doctor with face paint and pink hair. Scroll down for video . Sophie, right, spent years nurturing a relationship with her favourite clown doctor, left, Doctor Fairy Floss . On her first visit she met Dr Fairyfloss and Dr Fantastic, two colourful clown doctors who spend their days brightening the lives of children who need it the most. 'We were having to drive 5 hours to get to the hospital every week so the fact that you could spend the 5 hours talking about which clown doctor would be there was a great distraction and  therapy for her.' Sophie required painful and constant dressing changes and eventually ended up having surgery to release scar tissue after her middle finger started to retract. Sophie told Daily Mail Australia the clown doctors always went above and beyond doing 'anything they could' to give her and the other kids in the hospital a 'break from reality.' 'There would be some pretty bad things happening to me and it would hurt quite a lot but the clown doctors would totally take that away and make it fun.' 'There's no doubt in our minds that they had a massive impact on her physical healing by first nurturing her heart and emotions.' 'They would play with the equipment or have little things in their pockets that were really gross! They would tell me jokes and sing songs, even play the ukulele.' Doctor Fantastic, left, and Doctor Doctor would do anything in their power to lighten the mood . She said having the clowns around meant she looked forward to hospital visits as opposed to fearing them. After watching her daughter  emotionally connect with the clown doctors during such a challenging time in her life Ms Boyce said she was certain the doctors had a massive influence on Sophie's emotional well being. 'There were days where Sophie was having procedures to her hand and the clown doctor's were having difficultly distracting her so they would start finding medical instruments in the room to play sword fights or even throw water balloons on the roof.' 'There's no doubt in our minds that they had a massive impact on her physical healing by first nurturing her heart and emotions.' Ms Boyce said she found it challenging to describe exactly what the clown doctors did because it was more than just what they did, it was about how they made her daughter feel. 'Each day it was something different. There are times when she needed that big, bold slapstick comedy and there were others where they would sit quietly singing a song.' Sophie,left, was only three-years-old when she started coming to The Royal Melbourne Children's Hospital . The doctors were shocked by how quickly Sophie's hand healed and Ms Boyce attributed this to Sophie's overall happiness during her treatment. When a young child is forced spend a lot of time in hospital the experience can leave an emotional scar but Ms Boyce said, in Sophie's case, that couldn't be further from the truth with her experience really becoming 'a big part of who she is.' 'Sophie is very caring and community minded. She learnt that it's important to care for others and what kind of difference that can make in people's lives,' said Ms Boyce. Blue Steel: Sophie said having the clown doctors around made the experience less harrowing . She said Sophie became so involved with the clown doctors that she even started dressing up and joining in herself. 'It was kind of like I was one of them. You know when you're younger and you dress up as what you want to be when you're older? It was just like that.' 'They're my role models,' she added. Sophie said it can be hard for adults and parents to really understand what the clown doctors do but in her opinion 'they really do change lives.' Lou Pollard, who  goes by the name of Dr Quack, is one of sixty clown doctors prescribing doses of fun and laughter across 22 major hospitals in Australia. Long-time clown doctor Lou Pollard is more commonly known as Dr Quack around Sydney's child wards . She said being a clown doctor is all about 'making a connection' with children who may be going through 'the worst time of their lives.' 'International research has shown the physiological and psychological benefits that laughter brings to patients,' she said. 'It's our job to change the mood by having an open-hearted connection with kids who are often scared and really don't know what's going to happen.' 'If a kid is going to be in hospital, we want that child to go home having had the best experience they can possibly have' In what she calls 'diversional therapy', Ms Pollard and her collegues interject play, adventure and fun into an often bland and sterile hospital environment. 'You can take them on a playful journey and transform their room into a magical place.' 'If the doctor is putting a canular in the left arm, we will stand on the right and take them away from that medical procedure.' She said the added benefit is that it takes a lot of pressure off doctors who can do their job far more efficiently if their patient isn't distressed. 'If a kid is going to be in hospital, we want that child to go home having had the best experience they can possibly have,' Ms Pollard added. After spending years in the business Ms Pollard maintains humor therapy has 'measurable medical effects.' 'We've seen kids become very jaded and bitter about being in hospital and the pain they are going through and a lot of the time they are missing their friends and family back home. 'Bringing them back to a child like state where they can experience fun and joy really reminds them that they're still just little kids.' Some lucky Australian cricketers got the chance to see the good work the Clown Doctors are doing first hand after sending Steve Smith, Brad Haddin and Nathan Lyon to Randwick Children's hospital to test out some of Ms Pollard's terrible dad jokes. Spreading the joy: Some of Australia's best cricketers joined Dr Quack at the Randwick Children's Hospital . Children aren't the only patients the clown doctors end up treating either. Ms Pollard said their presence also gives parents a chance to take a time out of what can be 'an extremely overwhelming situation.' 'Adults are often terrified and worried about what will happen to their kids. If you have an incredibly worried parent and the kids see that and start to wonder what are they keeping from me?' Ms Boyce said she was surprised by the relief she felt every time a Clown Doctor came to visit Sophie. 'When you're in the hospital you are absolutely focused your child. You are frightened and concerned for them and it can be really hard to be the strong one in such a stressful environment.' She said the clown doctors create a sense of calm which gives parents the rare opportunity to see their kid with a smile on their face. Relieved: Ms Boyce said she felt a sense of calm when the clown doctors came to visit Sophie . Sophie and Ms Boyce are so passionate about spreading joy in hospitals all over Australia they have spent a considerable amount of time advocating for the alternative medicine. 'The sort of medicine the clown doctors dispense is just as important as the medicine the hospital is dispensing,' said Ms Boyce. 'As long as there are kids in hospitals, clown doctors need to be in hospitals.' While clown doctors are working in every major children's hospital across the country, they don't always get  to spend as much time there as they would like. Ms Pollard said clown doctors spend three or four days of the week in some major hospitals but some others are lucky to get one day of comedic relief a week. 'The only complaint we hear is why aren't you around more often?' said Ms Pollard. Laughter is the best medicine: Ms Pollard says clown doctors need to be in hospitals full time . The Clown Doctors are a not-for-profit organisation and receive no government or hospital funding so donations are vital to their continued existence. Ms Pollard said she was thrilled to see CommBank come on board to try and get clown doctors into more wards across Australia. Preying on societies obsession with selfies Comm bank have pledged to donate $5 to the Clown Doctors for every silly selfie posted on Instagram or Twitter before April 2 as long as it has the hashtag #ClowningForKids. They are aiming to raise a massive $200,000 to further fund the clown doctor operation. The hastag has already gained momentum with strangers from all over Australia posting pictures of themselves clowning around. Australian cricket great Michael Clarke got involved with this selfie earning the Clown Doctors five dollars . After spending years in the industry Ms Pollard said she goes to work every day knowing her job is a 'privilege.' 'You can’t change what has happened to them but you can change the way they looked at the world that day.’ Donations to the Clown Doctors can also be made at any CommBank branch until the end of March or online at commbank.com.au/clowndoctors.

Cody Clawson says Ford is a 'genuine hero' after saving his life in a dramatic helicopter rescue back in 2001. Cody was just 13 when he lost the trail during a Boy Scout camp in a remote forest just south of Wyoming's Yellowstone National Park. He was missing for almost 19 hours and helicopter pilot Ford – who lived part-time in Jackson, Wyoming at the time - joined a massive search-and-rescue mission to find him. Scroll down for video . This is the moment Harrison Ford rescued stranded Boy Scout Cody Clawson (both pictured) in his chopper . Rescue: Cody Clawson, pictured left as a boy scout aged 13, went missing during a camping trip in Yellowstone National Park and was lost for 19 hours overnight in the snow. He shone his belt to flag Ford down . 'Genuine hero': Clawson, now 26 and married with a son, hails the Star Wars actor as a real life star . Cody, now 26, recalls: 'We had just got to the camp and started unloading and I started to follow somebody who I thought was my dad. 'I lost track of him and before I knew it I was completely lost. 'I was just 13, I was pretty scared. I stayed where I was for about half-an-hour but no one came, so I started wandering, then I got really lost. 'I was missing overnight, it had rained and snowed that day so it was freezing cold. 'I was soggy, tired and hungry. I found a cave to take shelter and curled in to a ball. 'I was so tired I slept on and off.' Cody said he prayed to be rescued and was was only comforted by his religious beliefs. 'In the night I guess I had an epiphany or whatever you want to call it and the next morning I knew where I needed to go,' he said. 'I walked for a good few miles before I started hearing the search planes. I found a clearing next to a steep rocky outcrop and started making my way up. He was able to find a cave to sleep in and navigate himself but eventually, Clawson was stuck and afraid . 'I was about to start climbing it and that's when I saw the chopper.' Cody had seen Ford's helicopter circling above him but then suddenly the aircraft vanished from view. 'I had a Scout belt on which had a shiny brass buckle and I used it to reflect the sunlight to get their attention,' he said. 'I was definitely glad of my Boy Scout training at that point, but then the chopper passed over and had gone. 'I thought they hadn't seen me, I felt terrible and got a little depressed.' Luckily for Cody, Ford had spotted the teen and had set down his helicopter on the crest of a nearby hill. Cody recalled: 'This guy came down and was shouting my name. 'I was so relieved, he said, ""we're here to get you, but you'll never guess who's flying the helicopter?"" 'In my mind I was like, ""I really don't care"", I just wanted to get out of there. 'But he said it was Harrison Ford and I didn't believe him.' Cody said he didn't realize the rescuer was telling the truth until he got in to the back of the chopper. 'The pilot turned round and said, ""Good morning"". 'The way he said it reminded me so much of his role of Hans Solo in Star Wars. Then I was like, ""Oh my God, Han Solo has just rescued me, how cool is that"". 'I thought I was delirious at first but then realized I wasn't dreaming.' Ford flew the boy to a make-shift search and rescue headquarters that had been set up in the area. 'They said the camp was a mile-and-a-half from where I was so I was walking in the right direction,' he said. 'When we landed Harrison Ford came over to me and said: ""Boy, you sure must have earned a merit badge for this one."" 'But I told him I'd already earned this badge last summer, and he laughed. Avid flyer: Harrison Ford, 72, has been a trained pilot for more than two decades and has a bevvy of aircraft . Here he is pictured on an airfield surveying the fare. Clawson said he looked like Hans Solo in the driving seat . Crash: On Thursday afternoon, Ford crash-landed his vintage spitfire on a Los Angeles golf course . Handled: Experts hailed the landing as 'perfectly executed' as it was his only option when the engine failed . 'He had always been somebody I looked up to and appreciated. 'And what he did gave me a different perspective on stars. They sometimes get portrayed as snobby people, but there really is good, generous people out there. 'And to me Harrison Ford is one of those good people who we're lucky to have as an influence on our lives.' At the time Cody recalls Ford being interviewed about the rescue and the Indiana Jones actor said: 'I'm gonna fly anyway so I met as well fly search and rescue and help people.' Then Teton County Sheriff Bob Zimmer said Ford's volunteer efforts saved the department $1,000 an hour, the amount it would have cost to hire a private pilot. Cody admitted he was a little embarrassed by the incident but added that he was very popular with the kids on camp when they found out who rescued him. He said: 'The kids asked if I got an autograph but I told them, 'No, but I got a hug and a handshake, and that's better'. These days Cody, who lives with wife Kelsi and their 16-month-old son Kael in Ogden, Utah, works for a medical company making filters for dialysis machines. Life imitating art: Ford is perhaps best-known for his role as inter-galactic pilot Hans Solo in Star Wars . In the role, played alongside Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, he flew the fictional Millennium Falcon aircraft . He said that when he heard the news that Ford had crashed his vintage plane in Venice, California and had been injured, he was 'shocked' and 'genuinely concerned'. 'This guy saved my life, the first thing I thought is 'is he alright',' Cody said. 'I appreciated what he did for me all those years ago and I just hope he gets better and can help other people in future. 'He's a genuine hero, not just in the films, he's a great man.' It's not the only time Ford has been involved in a dramatic rescue. In July, 2000 the actor rescued Sarah George, 20, after she got in to difficulties on Table Mountain in Wyoming. George and her friend Megan Freeman, 22, were on a five-hour climb of the 11,106-ft mountain on July 31 when heat, altitude and dehydration left George sick and unable to take more than a couple steps. After another hiker called for help on a cell phone, the Star Wars star took to the air. Ford landed his helicopter in a meadow and picked up George; Freeman was told there wasn't enough room and had to hike down. 'He was wearing a T-shirt and a cowboy hat,' George told ABC News. 'He didn't look like I'd ever seen him before.' The ailing George vomited into the hat with about a minute to go before landing at Jackson's St. John's Hospital. 'I can't believe I barfed in Harrison Ford's helicopter,' she said.","Cody Clawson was 13 when he got lost in Yellowstone National Park .

She's quietly fighting back a week after her awkward and occasionally combative news conference on the furor over the private email server she used while running the State Department. Clinton's Twitter account is buzzing this week with posts that test political messages on health care, college affordability, civil rights and jobs -- issues she hopes will help mobilize President Barack Obama's Democratic coalition and pave her way to the presidency. Meanwhile, her nascent operation is leaking details of future staffers in an unmistakeable message to Democrats spooked by the email flap that the campaign-in-waiting will become an official effort, possibly as soon as next month. A CNN/ORC International Poll out on Wednesday found that she's miles ahead of any potential Democratic challenger and would beat all potential Republican candidates by at least 10 points. Despite fretting among some Democrats who worried that the party's best -- and perhaps only -- viable Democratic candidate appeared to be in trouble, early signs suggest Clinton is doing what the Clintons do best: mounting a comeback. ""The interest in the story is collapsing onto itself. I don't see an organic clamoring for more information,"" said a longtime Clinton ally who didn't want to speak for a campaign that hasn't yet been announced. This person, who has spent time in Iowa, argued that outside the community of political reporters and consultants in Washington and New York who fixated on the story, the people who really count -- voters -- weren't really interested. ""People very much want to know what the campaign is going to be about ... what is she going to do about student loan costs, for example?"" Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist who was Southern regional director of Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, agreed. ""If and when Hillary Clinton decides to run, she will have to address this issue, but I believe the American people are more interested in her addressing the kitchen table issues that matter most to them,"" he said. Of course, Clinton still faces plenty of challenges and the email saga raised questions about whether she can run a more sophisticated, no drama campaign than the one she managed in 2008. But the CNN poll revealed that those critical of Clinton's role in the email affair appear to break close to party lines and her favorable rating remains at 53%. A slow recent decline in that rating appears to coincide with Clinton's slow re-entry into partisan politics and does not necessarily reflect her recent stumbles. Perhaps the most intriguing figure in the poll is that only 1% of respondents had never heard of Clinton. That supports the idea expressed by some Democrats that Clinton may be the most vetted figure in public life. There are people who will never vote for her and those who are dedicated to her quest to be the first female president, but very few whose minds may not be made up. A less well-known candidate might have made a terrible first impression if faced with the kind of hyper-covered flap Clinton was. But Republicans believe the email scandal could be a political gift that keeps on giving, as it touches on a narrative that the Clintons are secretive, resistant to transparency and often blur the rules. There are also other problems -- including the question of foreign funds sent to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton's whopper speaking fees -- that Republicans believe could reach a political mass and fan doubts about the likely Democratic nominee's character. Then there are the foreign policy questions, including a now damaging photo op in which Clinton offered a ""reset"" button to Russia only for the country to revert to a Cold War-esque posture. She was also a central player in Obama's foreign policy, which often appears to be overtaken by the Middle East's swift descent into chaos. ""For everything that I can see, the Democrats have put all of their eggs in one basket here,"" said Sean Spicer, communications director of the Republican National Committee. ""That is more of a downfall in the general election than in the primary."" Spicer argued that even with younger voters, who do not remember the Clinton years, the question of impropriety over her emails could provide an entry point into past scandals. Though Clinton is the prohibitive Democratic front-runner, her support in the party is not universal. But where she faces resistance, it is more likely to be over policy than emails, as grass-roots Democrats are suspicious over her centrist, pro-business and hawkish foreign policy leanings. ""As this discussion was playing out inside the Beltway, our members were focused on issues,"" said Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org, which wants Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination. Galland said activists were preoccupied with the preservation of the social safety net, constraining Wall Street and those on the ""ragged edge"" of the middle class. Similarly, the young voters who flocked to Obama in 2008 and who will be crucial to Clinton's hopes of mobilizing an effective Democratic coalition in 2016 may also offer Clinton a political cushion. This group is hazy over historic references to long ago Clinton scandals like Filegate, Travelgate and even the Monica Lewinsky episode that led to President Bill Clinton's impeachment. ""The media loves a Clinton scandal,"" said one Democratic source who didn't want to be named because he doesn't work for Clinton. ""But young people are more likely to know her as secretary of state, and someone who ran for president in 2008."" Polling bears out the theory. The CNN survey shows Clinton's favorability among voters age 18 to 34 with a 22 point positive differential. But she's barely in positive territory among voters age 50 to 64, who are likely to have strong memories of her time as first lady, and is  underwater among those 60 or older. Another well-connected Democrat who didn't want to go on the record criticizing Clinton admitted that the email issue did play into GOP caricatures about the allegedly ""conspiratorial"" politicians and that it could challenge the former secretary of state's early efforts to get her message out about her ideas and rationale for running for president. But Democratic operatives think that once Clinton is actually running, with an infrastructure behind her, and striking messages about the minimum wage, college debt and middle-class economic issues, voters will engage. In many ways, the email furor was a story the media couldn't wait to write, so it may be that journalists have inflated the importance of the episode, at least in the absence of any evidence that Clinton broke the law or made classified information vulnerable. Political reporters have pined for weeks for Clinton to swing her campaign into action, and her failure to offer a storyline opened a vacuum that was easy for unflattering stories to fill. Her slow response breathed new life into a question that only Clinton can answer: Will her 2016 campaign be as dysfunctional, reactive and distracted as her chaotic and unsuccessful 2008 effort? But there were a few lessons. It's clear the Clinton machine is not about to morph into a humming, scandal-free effort in the image of Barack Obama's first presidential campaign. And Clinton's bitter relationship with political reporters seems as bad as ever. The days when she partied with a State Department press corps more preoccupied with policy than politics seem like ancient history. But here also, Clinton is trying a reset. Her nascent campaign has made it known that she is staffing up her campaign and press operation. John Podesta, who is expected to take a leadership role in her campaign, is respected by reporters, as is Jennifer Palmieri, the outgoing White House communications director expected to take on a similar role for Clinton. On Tuesday, it emerged that Clinton would name Brian Fallon, who has also good ties with reporters, to be lead press secretary.","Hillary Clinton fights to put furor over a private email server behind her .

Vincent Tabak was jailed in 2011 after strangling Miss Yeates and dumping her body in the snow on the outskirts of Bristol. Police seized his laptop as part of the investigation into her death and found 145 indecent images of children stored on it. Before admitting to possessing the child pornography, Tabak, 37, protested he would not receive a fair trial because his previous crime was so high profile. Guilty plea: Joanna Yeates's killer Vincent Tabak had admitted four counts of posessing child pornography after images were found on a laptop. He was jailed in 2011 after strangling the 25-year-old and dumping her body in snow . A judge rejected his argument, jailing him for 10 months at Bristol Crown Court, where he was found guilt of murder four years ago. The court heard how the paedophile had stored more than 100 images of children on the computer, with the youngest among them of younger than 10. Flanked by security guards, he held his head in his hands in the dock as the court heard how he had a 'perverse interest in child pornography.' In 2011, at the same court house, Tabak was convicted of killing 25-year-old Joanna Yeates after becoming obsessed with her. The 25-year-old's body was found covered in snow on the outskirts of Bristol . The pair were neighbours, with Miss Yeates living in the groundfloor flat next door to his where, jurors were told, he had watched violent pornography. After spurning his advances Miss Yeates was killed and dumped by the side of the road in Failand on the outskirts of the city. The jury heard how in the months before Jo’s death Tabak had viewed violent porn websites showing women being controlled by men, with images of them bound, gagged and held by the neck and choked. Others showed a woman who looked chillingly like his victim. Miss Yeates's frozen body - which had suffered 43 separate injuries - was found in a similar position to a woman in one pornographic film. In 2013, the Crown Prosecution Service announced they would pursue charges relating to child pornography. His guilty plea today came after a failed attempt by his legal team to have the case thrown out. They claimed he would not face a fair trial in and that he would not be given an additional prison sentence. Dean Armstrong QC, on behalf of Tabak, argued his portrayal in the ITV drama The Lost Honour Of Christopher Jefferies, who was wrongly accused of Miss Yeates's murder, would prevent fairness. Judge Neil Ford QC rejected the argument after telling the court it was not his position to comment on the CPS decision to prosecute. He also discounted the argument that putting Tabak on the Sex Offenders' Register would be pointless as it would have lapsed by the time of his release. Speaking after the sentencing, temporary assistant chief constable Julian Moss of Avon and Somerset Police said prosecution had been 'crucial'. Tabak's legal team argued he would not face a fair trial over the child pornography charges because of his portrayal in an ITV drama about Christopher Jefferies (right) who was wrongly accused of the murder and later successfully sued national newspapers for libel . Following his arrest for the murder of Joanna Yeares, Tabak's former girlfriend told police of his haul of pornography . 'Vincent Tabak is a dangerous, calculating and manipulative offender who is already serving a life sentence for the murder of Joanna Yeates. 'During the course of the investigation into Joanna's murder, indecent images of children were found on Tabak's laptop. These offences did not form part of the initial murder trial. 'Although he's serving a minimum tariff of 20 years' imprisonment, we felt it was crucial Tabak was brought to justice for possessing indecent images of children, so the full nature of Tabak's offending is on record.' Mr Moss said the conviction meant an 'extensive range' of protective measure could be put in place to manage his behaviour and protect those at risk. 'It's possible he may return to the Netherlands following release, so it's crucial the Dutch authorities are aware of the risks he poses,' Mr Moss added. 'This could only have been guaranteed if a relevant conviction relating to a sexual interest in children were secured. 'Joanna's murder was a shocking and terrible crime which had a significant impact on the whole of the Bristol community and I hope this latest conviction will ensure her killer is unable to cause any further harm.'

Not only does maintaining the regrowth take a lot of commitment but the chemical process of bleach on the hair can be incredibly damaging.'

Royal Mail has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the Government, new figures show. More than 8.7million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation – sparking fears that it risks becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. In the 12 months after privatisation, postmen pushed almost 50,000 more leaflets and advertising letters through our doors every single day, compared to the previous year. It means almost 3.2bn items of ‘unaddressed’ junk mail were delivered in just one year – almost double the 1.7bn delivered annually five years ago. These figures do not even include the vast quantities of ‘addressed’ junk mail also delivered, which have the names of occupants on the envelope. The rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for Royal Mail, which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted. Revenue from ‘marketing mail’ – addressed and unaddressed – has soared to £1.1bn a year, earning them £3million a day. Critics last night called for Royal Mail to reduce the amount of ‘nuisance’ junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a ‘leaflet distributor’. Royal Mail admitted junk Mail had become an ‘important component’ of its business, and insisted many households found advertising flyers ‘useful’. But much of unwanted junk mail is never opened and ends up being thrown straight into the bin – causing an environmental headache. While some households recycle takeaway menus and pamphlets, many tonnes of junk mail end up in landfill – costing councils tens of millions of pounds to dispose of. A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘Junk mail is a blight on the nation’s doormats. ‘Not only is it a nuisance to pick up and throw away, it adds thousands of tonnes to the waste councils have to pick up creating additional costs for tax payers. ‘Royal Mail and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail.’ Robert Rijkhoff, of the Stop Junk Mail campaign, said marketing mail was ‘the worst form of advertising’ because it was foisted upon households without their consent. He said: ‘Royal Mail needs to make money but, if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income, in the long term I am not sure it is a sustainable business. ‘Royal Mail is delivering less and less letters. They are risking that, in time, they will become a leaflet distributor.’ Critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas. Critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a 'leaflet distributor' with fewer letters being posted every year . In 2011, the National Fraud Authority claimed the Royal Mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy, making the scammers appear more trustworthy. At the time, Mike Haley, director of the National Fraud Authority, Royal Mail and other delivery firms needed to ‘understand the terrible consequences of delivery of this mail to some people’. Royal Mail said the rise in marketing mail was due to the improved British economy, as companies found they had more money to advertise their goods and services. A spokesman said: ‘Marketing mail is mail like any other – it is our job to deliver the mail. Companies use direct mail because it has proven results. ‘Many households find the information useful. Three in five people have acted in response to a piece of advertising mail in the last 12 months as a direct result of receiving door-to-door marketing material.’ As people increasingly stop posting letters in favour of email and text messages, Royal Mail said marketing mail was an important source of income. It said profit from this junk mail was important to ensure the survival of the universal service – its obligation to deliver to every address in Britain, six days a week, for the same price. They added that revenue from marketing mail helped to ‘keep UK stamp prices among the best value in Europe’. Despite this claim, first and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging revenue. The news sparked accusations from MPs that Royal Mail had taken the ‘easy option’ to raise stamp prices instead of fighting for new custom by improving its services. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the influential Business Select Committee, said Royal Mail must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency, rather than simply increasing prices to boost profits.","Almost 3.2billion items of 'unaddressed' junk mail were delivered last year .

The Barclays Premier League champions, who must overturn a 2-1 deficit against Barcelona on Wednesday night if they are to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League, have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since the start of the 2011-12 season. Despite spending an extravagant amount of money, Martin Demichelis and Fernando are the only two players who have managed to hold down a regular starting spot since sealing moves to the Etihad Stadium. Man City have made just two major changes to their starting line-up since 2011 despite spending £327m - Aleksandar Kolarov will replace Gael Clichy from the side defeated by Barcelona on February 24, 2015 . Fernando has replaced Gareth Barry while Martin Demichelis has come in for Joleon Lescott - above picture was taken before Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Napoli on September 14, 2011 . The aforementioned duo have replaced Joleon Lescott and Gareth Barry respectively in what is perceived to be Manchester City's strongest line-up. Gael Clichy has come close to edging his way into Manchester City's side but he shares left back duties with Aleksandar Kolarov and is suspended on Wednesday after being sent off in the first leg. Their major European rivals, on the other hand, have made at least six changes to their starting line-ups. Arsenal have made the most with 10 while upcoming opponents Barcelona have made six. Manchester City may have to change tack in Europe if they crash out of the Champions League on Wednesday, as a side of their calibre should be progressing to the latter stages of Europe's most prestigious competition. 2011: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Barry, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko . 2015: Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov; Silva, Toure, Fernando, Nasri; Aguero, Dzeko (two changes) Luis Suarez (left) and Neymar (centre) have joined Lionel Messi (right) at the Nou Camp . 2011: Valdes; Alves, Puyol, Pique, Abidal; Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta; Villa, Messi, Pedro . 2015: Ter Stegen; Alves, Mascherano, Pique, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta; Suarez, Messi, Neymar (Six changes) European champions Real Madrid have made six major changes in the same period - with the likes of Luka Modric and Gareth Bale sealing moves to the Santiago Bernabeu during the last four years.

'AA models work so hard to promote positive body images. You were given a body. Love it. Be proud. Don't fall into a mold,' she also tweeted on Tuesday. Casting director Phira Luon who wrote the email on March 18 that was later obtained by The New York Post issued a formal apology and said the email, 'was just an inappropriate off colour joke that was not intended to defame the clients name or philosophy/views in anyway,’ reported News.au.com. Nip no nip: The model on the left in see through white lingerie once had her nipples and pubic hair in full display more like the model in the back lingerie on the right .

News.au.com also reported that American Apparel’s new senior vice president of marketing, Cynthia Erland, allegedly told employees that they would not hire models who were 'too short and round.'

'I’ve never felt marginalised or unattractive working for this company until his past week or so,' that employee added. Erland responded to News.com.au in a statement that said, 'This is completely false. American Apparel embraces body types of all shapes, ethnicities and sizes, and our model casting has and will continue to reflect this.'

Despite Wayne Rooney levelling with his head after Nacho Monreal's opener, the night belonged to former United striker Danny Welbeck, who sealed the Gunners' victory with a beautifully composed finish. Here, Sportsmail's Neil Ashton rates every player's performance at Old Trafford. Arsenal's Danny Welbeck emphatically celebrates his goal, which went on to be the winner against his old club . MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-4-1) David De Gea: No chance with Monreal finish. Exposed brutally by Valencia when Welbeck raced through to score. Pulled off a couple of world class saves towards the end. 7.5 . Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea had a solid game but was exposed for Arsenal's second goal . Antonio Valencia: Powered forward with lung-busting run for United equaliser. Dreadful, dreadful back pass for Arsenal’s second. 6.5 . Chris Smalling: Solid without every really imposing himself. Has taken it upon himself to marshall back four. 6.5 . Marcos Rojo: Rock solid. Is he turning into United’s best defender? Granted, not a great deal of competition, but he is playing well. 7 . Despite the loss Marcos Rojo was one of United's top performers with some solid defending . Luke Shaw: At the mercy of van Gaal’s half-time tactical switch. Was neither good nor bad. Seemed a bit unfortunate to be hooked. 6.5 . Daley Blind: Hard to work out exactly what Van Gaal is asking him to do in there. Just seems to spend the entire game chasing after the ball. 6 . Angel di Maria: Has clearly gone mentally - should not be playing. Booked for foul, stupid to tug referee’s shirt. Went to sleep when Monreal made his run down the left in build up to Arsenal goal. Sweet cross for Rooney equaliser. 4 . United winger Angel di Maria tugs at Michael Oliver's shirt before seeing red at Old Trafford on Monday night . Di Maria trudges off the pitch after being sent off for his stupid reaction . Ander Herrera: Finally booked in 38th minute - amazing Michael Oliver took so long. Speed of game took him by surprise. Replaced by Carrick. 6 . Marouane Fellaini: One of the most prominent players in the team. Lovely 20 yard chip forward for Rooney’s one touch takedown before half time. Had chance to score too. 7.5 . Marouane Fellaini (right) tussles for the ball with Arsenal's dogged midfielder Francis Coquelin (left) Ashley Young: Hugged the touchline, but United should have got him on the ball more. Has legs to stretch defences. 6.5 . Wayne Rooney: Love affair with scoring in the FA Cup continues. Now has to find a way to win it. Breathtaking take down just before half time from Fellaini chip. 7 . Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney heads home the equaliser against Arsenal at Old Trafford . SUBSTITUTES: . Phil Jones (Shaw 46): Didn’t know whether to stay or go when Ozil or Welbeck dropped off. 6 . Michael Carrick (Herrera 46): Usual nice touches in midfield. 6.5 . Adnan Januzaj (Rojo 73): Brought on to give United life. By then they were dead. 6 . SUBSTITUTES NOT USED: Rafael, Mata, Falcao, Januzaj, Valdes. BOOKED: Herrera, Fellaini, Young. SENT OFF: Angel di Maria . MANAGER: Louis van Gaal: Tactical genius? Bladdered two players unnecessarily at half-time. Looks like yesterday’s man. Heading same way as Moyes at this rate. 3 . Di Maria makes the long walk towards the Old Trafford tunnel after being sent off . ARSENAL (4-2-3-1): . Wojciech Szczesny: Very little to do apart from Rooney’s goal, which he had no chance of doing anything to stop. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Early booking, cleaned out Young. Disciplinary tight-rope after that trying to stop the United winger 7 . Per Mertesacker: Left Koscielny exposed when Rooney scored, just seemed to switch off. Improved as game progressed. 7 . Per Mertesacker (right) and Laurent Koscielny allowed Rooney the space to head home United's equaliser . Laurent Koscielny: Lost Rooney for the United equaliser, allowed him to squeeze in to space behind him. 7.5 . Nacho Monreal: Showed ambition down the left when he kept on running after exchanging passes with Ozil in build up to goal. 7 . Nacho Monreal slips the ball past the oncoming Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea (right) Francis Coquelin: Screening job in front of Arsenal’s back four, rarely left his post. Turning into Mr Reliable. 7.5 . Francis Coquelin showed he is an indispensable player for Arsene Wenger after a solid midfield performance . Santi Cazorla: Switched roles when Ramsey came on, playing in a more advanced position. 7 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlin: Lovely, jinking run for the opening goal. Arsenal’s best player until he pinged left hamstring. 7.5 . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is floored after seemingly pulling his hamstring in the second half . Mesut Ozil: Clever pass into the feet of Oxlade-Chamberlain in move for Arsenal goal. Lovely lob wedge into Welbeck for penalty appeal. 7.5 . Alexis Sanchez: Such a willing worker, tireless up and down the flank. Flashes of his ability, but lacked his usual goal threat. 7 . Danny Welbeck: Kept his composure to put Arsenal back in front when her took the ball round De Gea with class and conviction. Good on him for that. 8 . Welbeck rounded De Gea with the deftest of touches before slotting home coolly against his former side . SUBSTITUTES: . Aaron Ramsey (Oxlade-Chamberlain 50): Unexpectedly thrust in at start of second half. 7 . Calum Chambers (Bellerin 65): Composed, looked the part when he came on. Added attacking threat too. 7 . Olivier Giroud (Welbeck 73): Came on for Welbeck to add physical presence to see this game out. 7 . SUBSTITUTES NOT USED: Gibbs, Walcott,  Martinez, Akpom. BOOKED: Bellerin. MANAGER - Arsene Wenger: Inspired decision to play Danny Welbeck against his former club. Arsenal’s name is on the Cup. 8 . REFEREE - Michael Oliver: Strong, one of best performances of season in this field. Character to send off Di Maria and it was the correct call. 8.5 . Arsene Wenger (centre) raised a few eyebrows for starting Welbeck, but his decision certainly paid off .","Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck scored the winner against his former club .
Angel di Maria was dismissed for dissent after pulling the referee's shirt .
Nacho Monreal opened the scoring and Wayne Rooney equalised but Welbeck's finish earned him the plaudits .","- Arsenal defeated Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford.

These shocking scenes from northern China drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country, who have called for a change in the law to protect the canines. But the local villagers who organised the event have defended the dogfights as necessary 'entertainment' in an isolated part of the country. Scroll down for video . Barbaric: These shocking scenes from northern China drew outrage from animal rights activists in the country . Bloody: The competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug . Spectacle: Hundreds of people turn up to watch the dogfights in northern China, which are held to mark the finale of the Spring Festival celebrations in the region . The dogfights, which lasted over several days, were organised by six villagers in Sanjiao village in Jishan county in northern China's Shanxi province to mark the finale of the Spring Festival celebrations. The competition was open to anyone who brought a dog along, and the winner of each bout was rewarded with a pack of cigarettes and a china mug. One of the organisers, Shi Pan, 45, protested that because the village was in a poor rural area, the locals had to resort to creating their own entertainment. He said: 'People in the city criticise our dogfights but they have all sorts of money to pay for entertainments which we don't have access to. We have to organise things to entertain ourselves.' While banned in some countries, dogfights are a common attraction in northern China which hosts more than 100 festivals each year attracting visitors from neighboring provinces and tourists alike. Police have said the event did not breach any laws and that there have been no official complaints. They added that some of the people who who turned up had allegedly grabbed stray dogs off the street, and claimed they were their pets. Attraction: While banned in some countries, dog fights are a common attraction in northern China . Violent: Despite the vicious scenes sparking outrage, organisers have insisted that the dogfights are part of the traditional 'entertainment' in the area . Brutal: The dogs are forced to fight to the death in cages, leading to calls from animal rights activists for new cruelty laws . Rural: Organiser Shi Pan declared the dogfights as a 'great success' and added: 'We plan to do the same thing next year' China has no animal cruelty laws, and a person who damages a dog or another animal can only be prosecuted for damaging property if the animal belongs to somebody. Dogfighting is illegal, but only if it involves bets. Simply allowing the animals to fight purely for entertainment comes into a grey area where it is difficult to prosecute anyone involved. Chung Lu, an animal rights activist in the country said, said: 'Events like these are exactly why we need a functioning animal cruelty law in China, because people do that they want and get away with it unless they know the law can stop them.' But a defiant Shi Pan said: 'It was a great success, we plan to do the same thing again next year. And we don't care what the people in the city say.'","Dogfights organised in northern China to celebrate end of Spring Festival .

Radio Station 3AW reported that the priest showed the congregation a picture of Adrian Bayley, the man convicted for the Melbourne woman's brutal rape and murder, before claiming that if Ms Meagher's faith had of been stronger she 'would have been home in bed' instead of 'walking down Sydney Road at 3am.' Scroll down for video . A priest told a congregation that Jill Meagher may not have been killed if she were 'more faith-filled' as she would have been 'home in bed' and 'not walking down Sydney Road at 3am' At least 100 people, including students, staff and parents, witnessed the comments at St Christopher's Primary School at Airport West on Friday. Greg Bennet apologised on behalf of the preist and said the 'offensive' comments did not reflect the views of the church . Monsignor Greg Bennett, vicar-general of the archdiocese of Melbourne, condemned the homily and said the 'offensive' comments did not represent the views of the church. 'We do not share the sentiment of the homily this morning and we certainly apologise for the hurt that this homily may have caused today,' he told 3AW. 'The reference to Jill Meagher in particular was offensive and inappropriate and the people of Victoria and Ireland mourn her sad and tragic death.' He said he has spoken with the priest who acknowledges that the homily was not appropriate and apologises for the 'upset' and 'offence' it may have caused. Carolyn Worth, manager of the South Eastern Centre Against Sexual Assault, told Fairfax media that the comments were an 'extreme' form of 'victim blaming'. 'This is about a violent, dangerous man who attacked somebody. It's not about what she was doing,' she said. The revelations come amid comments from Victoria police, spurred by the stabbing murder of Masa Vukotic, warning women to take reasonable precautions when walking in parks at night, and if possible avoid it all together. Ms Worth said women 'have a right' to walk the streets alone without fearing an attack from a 'dangerous predator'. Dangerous predator:Mr Bayley was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of raping and killing Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012 . 'It's offensive to all women, certainly to Jill Meagher's family. In some ways it's insulting to religious people too because it isn't about being out at 3am. [Masa Vukotic] was out at 7pm at a time lots of us would be out walking. You expect to be safe from being attacked at any of those times. 'To have someone suggest that the problem is that you don't believe in God enough is ignoring completely what actually happens when there are dangerous men out attacking people.' Mr Bayley was sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of raping and killing Ms Meagher in a Brunswick laneway in September 2012. Backlash: Twitter users didn't take the 'victim blaming' comments lightly . The priest faced harsh criticism for the comments he made in front of a group of primary school children . Since his conviction the extent of Mr Bayley's sordid past has come to light with revelations that he raped a Dutch backpacker and a St Kilda sex worker in the months leading up to the ruthless attack on Ms Meagher. Mr Bayley has now been found guilty of more than 20 rape offences. Repeat offender: Mr Bayley has been found guilty of more than 20 rape offences . At the time of the murder he was out on parole having served eight years of an 11-year sentence for sex assaults in St Kilda.

Now, the 23-year-old former model has released her $16 food bible, Deliciously Ella, in the U.S. - with a list of banned foods so long it would make self-described lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow's eyes water - and already it has shot to number one on Amazon's cookbook list. 'Healthy eating doesn’t have to be crazily complicated, it can actually be so fun,' Ella tells Daily Mail Online of her approach, which consists of no meat, dairy, eggs, gluten, refined sugar, caffeine, or processed foods of any kind, and rarely any alcohol. Green goddess: British health blogger Ella Woodward, 23, (pictured) has become the fastest debut cookbook seller in U.K. history, and the U.S. release of her book is proving wildly successful too . 'My aim is to get people excited about eating more veggies, and seeing them as a delicious ingredients rather than a chore,' the brunette beauty explains. Ella's ultra-clean diet may seem unfeasible to most, but her recipes have won her a staggering following; more than 42 million hits to her blog, Deliciously Ella, a recipe app which shot to the top of the U.S. and U.K. charts last year, and now, a record-breaking cookbook. And while some might think that Ella's health-focused food strategy would fail to catch on in the U.S. - where more than two thirds of adults are classified as obese or overweight - Ella feels that her strong American following is down to that fact that health foods, and veganism, have become so incredibly popular, even more so here than in the U.K. 'I spent a lot of time in Los Angeles last year, and taking care of yourself is just so normal there,' she remarks. 'No one thinks you're mad for going hiking and drinking green juice for fun.' Fan favorites include Ella's brownies, which are made from a base of sweet potatoes, and her coconut Thai curry, a creamy medley of squash and chickpeas. Success: Ella has amassed more than 42 million views on her blog since 2012, and her new cookbook (pictured), released in the U.S. this month, has already shot to the top of Amazon's best-selling cookbook list . Watch and learn: The health guru, pictured on the Today show last week teaching Matt Lauer a few tricks, says that vegan eating can be 'so much more than nut roasts' In the U.K, Ella - the daughter of a supermarket heiress and a politician - has been hailed as 'the new Nigella Lawson', but beyond their shared success, and their very pretty faces, Ella admits that her food philosophy couldn't be further from that of Ms Lawson's. 'It’s a gigantic compliment, and a huge honor to know that people see me in that way,' Ella says. 'And it’s true - our philosophies are very different - but we both love food a lot.' And while Ella may eschew butter, cream, bacon and all the usual mainstream indulgences, eating vegan, she says, is 'so much more than nut roasts'. 'It can be beautiful, delicious, satisfying, comforting dishes,' she says. 'From butternut squash risotto to creamy coconut porridge, baked falafels, pesto pasta, chocolate cookies, avocado chocolate mousse and berry scones with coconut cream.' Health machine: A self-confessed former 'sugar monster', who used to gorge on candy and fast food, Ella now eschews meat, dairy, eggs, gluten, refined sugar, processed food, caffeine, and rarely drinks alcohol . Healed: Ella turned her unhealthy ways around 18 months ago, in a last-ditch attempt to cure herself of a sudden, chronic illness, postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTs) A self-confessed former 'sugar monster', who used to gorge on candy and fast food, Ella turned her unhealthy ways around 18 months ago, in a last-ditch attempt to cure herself of a sudden, chronic illness: postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTs). The little-understood disease affects the nervous system, and, quite out-of-the-blue, left her in constant pain, sleeping for 16 hours a day, riddled with infections and so bloated she had to wear her father’s clothes. After giving up all animal products and all processed food, however, Ella managed to heal herself, where months in hospital and endless courses of medication failed to do so. 'I haven’t felt symptoms returning since I came off my medication, which is incredible,' she says. 'I’m conscious of the way I live and do things every day that nourish my body. I eat well, I work out, I try to manage stress, I get a good sleep in, and together that does wonders.' Holistic lifestyle: 'I eat well, I work out, I try to manage stress, I get a good sleep in, and together that does wonders,' says Ella, pictured in London at Red's Women of the Year Awards in September . One criticism Ella does face, however, is how expensive her ingredients are. Many of her recipes require large quantities of expensive nuts, medjool dates and obscure ingredients like psyllium husk powder and maca, for example. 'The baking part can be expensive, but I don’t bake that regularly,' she says. 'The things I cook and eat on a regular basis are really inexpensive. 'I eat mostly seasonal veggies, beans, brown rice and homemade hummus. Then I make big batches of soups and recipes, like my chili and curry, which, again, are pretty inexpensive, and they’re great things to stock your freezer with.' Healthy spin: One of Ella's most famous recipes is for her brownies (left), which are made from a base of sweet potatoes. Pictured (right), the cover of her newly-released cookbook . Asked whether any aspect of her choice to go vegan was related to ethics, or animal welfare, Ella, who wears fur, said no. 'I always say that anyone should adapt my recipes to make it work for them, and if that means adding salmon or chicken, then I’m very supportive of that,' she explains, adding that she has 'learned a lot' about the meat and dairy industry recently, and does see problems with it. Ella is currently working on two further cookbooks, with plans to spend more time in the U.S. in the near future. In the meantime, her favorite recipes from her debut book? 'The coconut Thai curry, the cacao and almond butter fudge, and the beetroot and chocolate cake with a coconut frosting,' she says. 'Awesome, and so easy to make.'","Ella's debut cookbook, Deliciously Ella, $16, broke all sales records in the U.K. and is proving hugely popular in the U.S. too .

The price of hitting yourself on the thumb or hanging wallpaper upside down has just got cheaper. For Poundland is launching a range of 200 DIY essentials from hammers to packs of paint brushes and screwdrivers - and yes, they all cost no more than £1. The thriving budget chain has signed a partnership with celebrity builder Tommy Walsh, who appeared alongside Alan Titchmarsh in the BBC’s Changing Rooms, to develop and test the range. Recent reports from major DIY warehouses suggest many young adults don’t have the skills or the interest in home make-overs or doing jobs around the home. However, Mr Walsh insists people can save a fortune by avoiding the need for tradesmen if they have their own tools and make sure they plan their jobs carefully. He claims the items in the range are at least five to six times more expensive at the major DIY chains. He gave the example of a three piece professional paint brush set, which would be at £5-£6 at a leading shop. Other items include a 7.5m tape measure and 20g tube of superglue, as well as a 1m spirit level, paint rollers and trays, masking tape, a five pack of screwdrivers and the 330g tubes of all-purpose filler and mastic. ‘The cost of calling out a tradesman or even buying tools for small home improvements can mount up quickly,’ Mr Walsh said. ‘DIY should be accessible and affordable for everyone. Customers can fill their toolbox with all the essentials they need for as little as £10.’ The range has been trialled by tradesmen who decorate and carry out repairs for a living to ensure it is robust and easy to use. The grips have been ergonomically designed so the hand tools are easy to use for long periods without causing blisters. The decision by Poundland to move into DIY comes just as some of the big names are closing outlets, following a fall in trade. Homebase is shutting 80 stores amid claims today’s home makers do not know how to do even simple jobs like putting up a shelf or a curtain pole. Budget: The chain hopes to step in to the gap left by floundering . Poundland has helped DIY novices by splitting the range into four colour coded categories - ‘Decorating Essentials’ in red, ‘Adhesives’ in blue, ‘Toolbox Essentials’ in yellow and ‘Fixtures and Fittings’ in orange. Each pack will provide tips from Mr Walsh on how to carry out the corresponding DIY task. The partnership with the celebrity builder is part of a wider trend by the budget chain to bring in middle income shoppers. It already offers Jane Asher bakeware range, which has achieved double its predicted sales, while there are beauty products that have been well received by the fashion press, and jewellery. Poundland chief executive Jim McCarthy said: ‘Purchasing DIY products can be very expensive. We believe we have identified a gap in the market and can challenge other retailers with our more affordable products. ‘Tommy’s range offers outstanding value for money and will make home improvement accessible for everyone no matter what their budget.’","Poundland is now selling a wide variety of tools each costing £1 .

The Burkholderia pseudomallei bacteria was found in animals at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Louisiana, which is just 35 miles north of New Orleans. The bacteria, primarily found in south-east Asia, can spread to animals and humans through direct contact with contaminated soil and water. A potentially deadly bacteria has been accidentally released from a high-security research laboratory leading to serious safety fears (stock image) But despite thorough investigations by multiple authorities the cause of the release and extent of the contamination are still unknown. It is the latest in a series of significant accidents that have taken place across the country. Richard Ebright, a biosafety expert from Rutgers University in New Jersey, said the release was worrying. Burkholderia pseudomallei can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis. Melioidosis commonly involves the lungs and has a wide range of symptoms including fever, headache, loss of appetite, muscle and joint pain. It is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Several countries have studied using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics. If the disease is left untreated it is fatal. The overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in Thailand, where the bacteria is endemic, it is up to 50 per cent. Confirmed infections are relatively rare. 'The fact that they can't identify how this release occurred is very concerning,' he told USA Today. 'Human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident. The easiest way to transfer something from one place where it's supposed to be, to another where it isn't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other.' Research was being completed at the center using rodents to try and find a vaccine against the bacteria. But at least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been accidentally exposed to it. The first was discovered nearly three months ago in November and two have since died. All four were in the center's veterinary hospital at the same time, leading to speculation that it could have been where the animals were exposed. At least four rhesus macaques - monkeys that were kept in a separate part of the 500-acre facility - have been exposed to the bacteria (stock image) But one US Department of Agriculture (USDA) investigator was also hospitalised after blood tests showed she had antibodies indicating a current or prior exposure to the bacteria. She is now recovering. Authorities are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk. Only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in Thailand. Andrew Lackner, director of the center, said: 'We're taking this extraordinarily seriously. It's very disturbing to us.

William Hanna, 65, and Dianne Whitehouse, 59, were previously convicted of causing or inciting involvement in child pornography for their offences with a 'damaged' 15-year-old girl at a Birmingham hotel. Both were also convicted, and jailed, for sexual activity with the vulnerable teenager. Cleared of charge: William Hanna, 65, and Dianne Whitehouse, 59, had their convictions of causing or inciting involvement in child pornography overturned as their live streaming of sex sessions was not permanent . But after the pornography ruling was quashed by the Court of Appeal, a retrial at Birmingham Crown Court ended with a jury being directed to return not guilty verdicts. The ruling came after it was judged the live streaming of the pair's sex sessions with their victim did not fit the legal definition of pornography, which must be recorded in a permanent form. Directing the jury to clear the pair, Judge Richard Bond said: 'These defendants have been convicted of sex offences. 'In regards to these charges it is a legal technicality we are dealing with it is important if someone is going to be convicted there are convicted on what the law states. 'The law says this offence can only be committed if data being streamed is recorded. There was no recording in this case, and if there was no recording then the offence is not made out.' Also took part: Ian McGlasson, 49, of Reading, was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions . Former Frankley Community School teacher Hanna, previously of Acocks Green, Birmingham, was jailed for seven years in 2013 after being convicted of three charges of sexual activity with a child. Girlfriend Whitehouse was jailed for six years after being convicted of two charges of the same offence. Their trial heard how they met their victim online before 'degrading' her in sessions at the Etap Hotel, off Bristol Road, Birmingham which were streamed live on the internet. In one session a man dressed in a catsuit entered the room and had sex with the teen. Jailing the pair in 2013, Judge Patrick Thomas QC said Hanna and Whitehouse had taken advantage of an 'intensely troubled and damaged child' and 'relished' her young age. He told them: 'You treated her not as a damaged child who needed protection, but as somebody who could be simply used as you wished. 'You involved her in sexual activity which must have had the effect of damaging her even further.' Of the live streaming, the judge said: 'In addition to the degradation of that child, she knows an unknown number of people have had the opportunity to view that degradation.' A third man, Ian McGlasson, 49, of Reading, was jailed for six years for involving the same victim in bondage sessions. He admitted six charges of sexual activity with a child, two of meeting a child following grooming and possessing and taking indecent images. Loophole: After the pornography ruling was quashed by the Court of Appeal, a retrial at Birmingham Crown Court (above) ended with a jury being directed to return not guilty verdicts .","William Hanna and Dianne Whitehouse jailed for sexual activity with girl, 15 .

Called AdvicyDrive, the wearable monitors your heart rate while driving to determine how awake you are. If it detects a drop in heart rate, which suggests you're dozing off, it sounds an alarm on a connected smartphone. Scroll down for video . The AdvicyDrive sensor monitors your heart rate while driving to determine how awake you are. If it detects a drop in heart rate, which suggests you're dozing off, it sounds an alarm on a smartphone (illustrated) When a person falls to sleep their heart rate drops by up around 10 to 30 beats per minute on average. To detect the most subtle of these changes, AdvicyDrive uses digital photoplethysmography (PPG) -  an imaging test used to detect changes in blood flow at the microvascular level on the skin. Last year, researchers from the Biomechanics Institute in Valencia, Spain unveiled the Harken system. It measures the driver’s heart rate and breathing via a sensor system knitted into the seatbelt and seat cover. If the rates drop too much, a warning alarm goes off. Designer Jose Solaz said: ‘The variation in heart and respiratory rate are good indicators of the state of the driver as they are related to fatigue. 'Harken can monitor those variables and warn the driver before the symptoms appear.’ The researchers said the system is innovative because it can cancel out the motion of the car and only pick up heart and respiratory rate thanks to the ‘smart textile materials’ embedded in the seat cover and seatbelt. It's typically used to monitor blood flow in people with Raynaud's disease, for example, from their fingers and toes. The technology shines a green LED onto the skin, and based on the variations in colour that are reflected back, the sensor can detect the heartbeat. It uses a traffic-light system to monitor the beats and will issue a cautionary warning if it begins to drop into the 'amber' section. The loud alarm rings when the rate reaches the 'red' zone'. Its Italian designers said: 'The pulsed light sensor technology  is the best on the market in terms of stability, reliability even in motion and in terms of energy consumption.' They added that the detection is on par with a chest band 'without the disadvantage of having to wear an uncomfortable strap'. The clip can be fitted to a wristband but will also attach to a person's underwear. It will work as long as its in contact with the skin. The sensor is currently under development, so these claims have not been put to the test, and the firm has launched a campaign on Kickstarter to fund the project. Kits are available to pre-order for £70 and will retail for £100 if the campaign is successful.

The series of photos shows the friends taking turns as they stand on top of a boulder that is wedged between a mountain crevice in Norway, with a direct drop of nearly 800ft. The incredible experience provides impressive views for those who are brave enough to step foot on the boulder, but those who are afraid of heights would become weak at the knees and think better of it. Scroll down for video . Ronny Randen, 39, took the photos while he was travelling with five friends to climb Preikestolen, also known as Pulpit Rock . Kjeragbolten – the official name for the boulder – is located on the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Rogaland, Norway. It is situated more than 3,500ft above sea level and is a popular photo spot for thrill-seekers who are willing to risk their lives for a memorable holiday photo. Despite the rain making its surface slippery the group of visitors in these photos ventured onto the boulder and posed with their arms in the air or a thumb extended as other tourists waited their turn. Software developer Ronny Randen, 39, took the photos while he was travelling with five friends to climb Preikestolen, also known as Pulpit Rock. Kjeragbolten – the official name for the boulder – is located on the edge of the Kjerag mountain in Rogaland, Norway . He said: ‘During our visit if was a rainy, and the boulder was actually a bit slippery. There's a little path on the left side where you can jump onto the rock. ‘It's hard to describe the feeling of standing on the boulder. After walking up the mountains your legs are a bit tired, and the idea of jumping onto, and balancing on, a slippery boulder hanging above a fjord seems like a really bad idea. ‘But, to be honest, it's not hard getting out there, and it is well worth it.’ Mr Randen, dressed in blue, can be seen posing on the boulder with his hands in the air and in one photo, taken from a distance, shows the stunning view and terrifying drop. Despite the rain making its surface slippery the group of visitors in these photos ventured onto the boulder for some memorable snaps . Mr Randen, who lives just outside Oslo, said the hike up to Kjeragbolten is demanding as it involves three steep climbs. He added: ‘Most of the time you walk on smooth rock and boulders and because it was rainy and foggy it was a bit slippery. ‘There are metal chains along the steepest climbs of the trail. When we finally arrived at the boulder it was rather foggy but after a while it started to clear up and we were rewarded with a stunning view of the Lysefjord. ‘The whole experience was so breathtaking and just looking at the images now really takes me back there. ‘It's not a place you go very often as it's a bit remote, but it's such an amazing piece of art from nature that it is definitely worth going.’","The amazing photos were taken by a group of tourists at the Kjeragbolten boulder in southern Norway .

The new boss has revealed that he was waiting for the Black Cats to sack Gus Poyet and was surprised it did not happen sooner. Indeed, in the wake of Sunderland’s 4-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday there were reports that Advocaat was set to take over, despite this being some 48 hours before Poyet was dismissed. Reports in Holland suggest Dick Advocaat was surprised his predecessor Gus Poyet was not sacked sooner . Poyet was sacked after Sunderland were beaten 4-0 at the Stadium of Light by rivals Aston Villa . Advocaat said John O'Shea (left) will have to play despite not training in the week as the squad is small . The Dutchman said: ‘I expected they would do it (sack Poyet) earlier, but they didn't. ‘Poyet was a coach who is very self-focussed. They were looking for someone with experience, a guy who knows what it's about. For this short time they didn't want to take the risk to get an inexperienced coach.’ Advocaat will take charge of the team for the first time at West Ham tomorrow and, with his new club just one point above the Premier League drop zone, he has revealed his stark message to the players. ‘As I said to the players, it’s quite simple. This is a big, big club – do you want to play in the other league?’ he said. ‘With this club, this stadium, you cannot play in the lower league. I think they realise how important it is. Midfield player Sebastian Larsson has also missed training but will be called upon by Advocaat . Advocaat believes Sunderland have a competitive squad when all of their players are fully fit . ‘We have nine games to go and are still a point ahead, so we have everything in our own hands. ‘Keeping this team in the league is the most important thing. ‘There is enough quality in this squad to stay up. We have a difficult programme, as do the other teams, but it’s all up to us and I have a good feeling about it.’ Meanwhile, it has been reported that Advocaat is open to the idea of staying at the club beyond the end of the season.

'I’ve tried hard to break out of that TOWIE box and I think I’ve done that,' she said. 'I was only on there for two seasons but people instantly pigeon hole you as ""Essex"", but that’s not what I’m about and my collection is for everyone; I don’t just design for TOWIE fans.' While her former co-stars do support her fashion career, Amy has her sights set on Hollywood. 'I’d love to dress Dakota Johnson,' she admitted. 'She’s so stunning.

'I’m really looking forward to relaxing somewhere sunny with friends – I spend most of the year being businesswoman Amy so it’ll be nice to kick back and just be fun Amy,' she said. 'I go on holiday with my best friend usually; I would love to share it with someone special though, maybe in the future?,' she teased. She does, however, admit that men 'definitely' struggle to approach her because of who she is. She said: 'Some of my guy friends say they’ve heard that guys have not come and said ""hi"" to me as they were intimidated. I don’t get it though.' So what kind of relationship is Amy looking for?

Once described as 'the most hated man in Britain', an emotional Farage appeared to break down in tears he said how his children were being judged 'unfairly'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage broke down in tears as he described how his children had been bullied . 'We have this very unusual surname, there aren't many of us, and that is difficult, it is difficult,' said the MEP who has two children under the age of 15 and another two in their 20s, . 'It is difficult when you are younger because you are going to get teased mercilessly wherever you go, but it actually difficult when you are grown up too, because people are judging you unfairly by your father, and that's tough, that is tough.' But he said his family's struggle would not make him give up the chance to establish Ukip as a party with real political sway. 'I've got to go with it and to hell with the consequences,' he added. It appears his ambition is paying off as Ukip are predicted to win six seats in the general election. Farage himself had unsuccessfully contested British parliamentary elections for UKIP five times, both before and after his election as an MEP. In August 2014 he was selected as the UKIP candidate for South Thanet in this year's general election. He was recently questioned on his 'most hated' title during an appeareance on Loose Women.

Mr Farage said his family's struggle would not make him give up the chance to establish Ukip as a party with real political sway. His wife Kirsten is pictured left . Actress Linda Robson, one of the show’s panellists, asked Mr Farage why he had been voted ‘the most hated man in Britain’. He said: 'You look at these political figures, they are all like cardboard cut-outs. They are all playing safe, they are all scared of the media. I’m not, I’m a bit like Marmite. People either like me or don’t like me.’ He added that all politicians are fundamentally ‘selfish’ and neglect their families. He said: ‘The other three big leaders are very good at coming on programmes like this and saying what wonderful family men they are, how they do the school run and when the babies were little they changed all the nappies and did the night feeds. Maybe that’s true. All I can say is, it’s pretty much impossible to do that.’ Often pictured down the pub pint in hand, Farage also admitted he also had a secret nocturnal habit- shore fishing. The party leader said he would often travel down to the coast from London and have three or four hours of fishing through to the early hours after a busy day.","Nigel Farage broke down in tears as he described children being bullied .

Its bizarre blueprint, which also included a tax on nappies and a better standard of living for rodents, was laid out at the party's annual conference in Liverpool this weekend. Likening the killing of sea creatures and monkeys to that of humans, its leader Natalie Bennett urged the law be changed to ensure anyone found guilty of such crimes against animals face a prison sentence. Addressing the conference she said the move would create a 'peaceful political revolution' at May's General Election. Her proposal would see the 1948 Human Rights Act extended to protect 'all sentient life forms'. Taxes on nappies, bans on horse racing and the creation of a fleet of hospital ships for the third world were also set to become official policy for the during a series of debates today. The Greens also plan to form an alliance with the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru to force a minority Labour government to cut the defence budget. Funding would be taken from  nuclear deterrence to be spent on foreign aid, increasing the budget to £16 billion a year, or one per cent of GDP. On Sunday members were due to debate using the budget to build a fleet of hospital ships to provide worldwide humanitarian aid and support. The party also proposes new levies on manufacturers of disposable nappies. Plans to extend the Human Rights act, which states that 'no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'  would mean anyone killing, torturing or 'kidnapping' dolphins, whales, apes and elephants would occur for equivalent crimes committed against humans.

Should Danny Welbeck have been sold to Arsenal last summer? Should he have celebrated his winning goal back in Manchester? Both questions were irrelevant. Welbeck is an honest and talented footballer but he wouldn’t make a difference to Louis van Gaal’s United. He is good without being really good. Danny Welbeck shoots to score the winning goal against Manchester United on Monday night at Old Trafford . A stranded David de Gea (right) looks on as the goalkeeper was beaten by former United player Welbeck . Welbeck celebrated his goal against his former club as Arsenal won the FA Cup tie 2-1 . Welbeck is swamped by his Arsenal team-mates on a night to forget for United supporters . United manager Louis van Gaal (left) and assistant Ryan Giggs watch on during their latest defeat . Welbeck, whose international record is better than his club record, scored a well-taken and well-anticipated goal on Monday and celebrated appropriately. His overall performance, though, was modest. Had he been playing in red rather than in blue and yellow, the result would not have been different. On Tuesday Welbeck said: ‘Manchester United is a club that means so much to me. I’m a fan and it’s hard to knock them out. I’ll always respect the fans. I had a lovely reception and I’m thankful for that.’ But United’s problems under Van Gaal go much deeper than any associated with his decision last August to sell a player he figured — with reason — would have been his fourth-choice centre forward. Van Gaal cut a frustrated figure during the match as he and his team lost their last chance of a trophy . United's (left to right) Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney look frustrated on the pitch . Tactical genius? Not quite. Louis van Gaal received 3/10 for his tactics on Monday night, but what about the players? CLICK HERE FOR FULL RATINGS . The most telling moments of this FA Cup tie came in the second half. It was a close game at that point. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will have been disappointed his team had conceded an equaliser so carelessly so soon after taking the lead but at half-time he appeared to tell his team to continue in the same vein. Van Gaal, however, sniffed danger, or thought he did. He made two substitutions, neither of them positive, and that seemed indicative of a coach unsure of his players and unconvinced by his original plan. He did a similar thing at Swansea recently and United lost that one, too. Later, with United chasing in the wake of Welbeck’s goal and Angel di Maria’s sending-off, Van Gaal pushed Marouane Fellaini — and, soon after, Chris Smalling — to the top of the United formation and asked them to feed off a diet of long balls pumped from their own half. Angel di Maria is sent off by referee Michael Oliver after the midfielder grabbed the official's shirt . Di Maria applauds the United supporters after being sent off for manhandling the referee during the tie . Radamel Falcao sits on the bench next to Juan Mata as the on-loan striker went unused against Arsenal . Van Gaal issues instructions alongside Giggs but their tactics and substitutions were questionable . With their exit from the FA Cup against Arsenal, Manchester United's attention now rests solely on the Premier League. Yet United haven't beaten a side currently in the top half since their home win against Liverpool in mid December last year. CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL STORY . This is a valid tactic and one that worked at West Ham last month. Fellaini, in particular, can be strangely effective in that role. Nevertheless, while this was going on, United’s Spanish playmaker Juan Mata and their Colombian centre forward Radamel Falcao sat in the dug-out. They were still there when an aimless hoof from Phil Jones rolled out of play for a goal-kick and referee Michael Oliver signalled the end of the game. This, perhaps, is most damning. Van Gaal’s tactical preferences can be discussed all night long. United, whether they knew it or not, hired a pragmatist last summer and it is that side of the manager that the supporters are seeing now. More pertinent is the fact that one of European football’s leading coaches decided — at the sharp end of a home cup tie that he knew his team must win — to put his trust in some Hackney Marshes football rather than ask two players in whom his club has invested millions of pounds to go on and change the game through method and design. It is a strange state of affairs and one that tells us Van Gaal has limited faith in his players. It also points to problems that will greatly affect United’s transfer strategy this summer. Calum Chambers of Arsenal competes for the ball with Adnan Januzaj and Marouane Fellaini . Van Gaal knows he has to look for a new right back, central defender, holding midfielder and forward . Van Gaal's tactics have been questionable this season since he came to United as manager . They’re out of the FA Cup and Manchester United face the hardest run-in of the top-four hopefuls...

Van Gaal knows he needs a right back, central defender, holding midfielder and a centre forward. That is probably about £150million right there. The Dutch coach also knows, however, that he needs to ease out some very big names to make that happen. Van Gaal has to make decisions about Mata, Falcao, Robin van Persie and Rafael da Silva and that is before he addresses the issue of whether less glamorous types such as Jones, Smalling and Jonny Evans are evergoing to mature into footballers good enough to help United back to the top of the Premier League. Van Gaal has spoken many times about his squad lacking balance. What he has been understandably less candid about is the fact that it is just not good enough. There are problems with players such as Di Maria that need time and tactical tuning to address. There is, at least, no doubt about his quality. The cross he delivered for Wayne Rooney to equalise on Monday was evidence of that. Di Maria is not the issue. It is the supporting cast — such as Adnan Januzaj and Ashley Young — that Van Gaal remains unsure about. At Arsenal, Wenger has his critics. His team remain skittish and unpredictable. Nobody can accuse the Arsenal manager of not knowing his own mind, however. There is a methodical consistency about Wenger that, for better or for worse, is clear from the way he chooses and sets up his teams. The same cannot be said about Van Gaal. At the United training ground on Wednesday, the increasingly irritable manager will be looking for something new, trying to find yet another way of turning water into wine before Sunday’s home game with Tottenham. What is unclear though, is whether this constant changing of personnel and tactics tells us more about the limitations of the manager or the players.

The Chancellor’s proposal is expected to become a key part of the Tory manifesto, but will not be included in tomorrow’s Budget after it was blocked by the Liberal Democrats. Plans to raise the inheritance threshold to £1million were included in the party’s manifesto at the last election, but were vetoed as part of the Coalition deal in 2010. Scroll down for video . Passing on properties: The tax break would mean just over 20,000 fewer estates would annually have any inheritance liability. A file photo of a road in Wandsworth, south-west London, is pictured . According to Treasury papers leaked to The Guardian, the proposed measures would also reduce the inheritance tax bill on properties worth up to £2million by £140,000. The tax break, which would mean just over 20,000 fewer estates would annually have any inheritance liability, is expected to cost nearly £1billion. In the papers, the officials note that the move ‘will generally be very popular with the public and in the media. It will allow you to say you are exempting those with modest homes from inheritance tax (with up to £1million of assets) exempted in certain circumstances.’ The document, prepared for Treasury financial secretary David Gauke, added: ‘You have indicated a desire to reduce the burden of inheritance tax. ‘Having considered the cost of a substantial increase in the existing nil rate band, you and the Chancellor have indicated you would like instead to introduce a more targeted measure to allow the family home to be passed onto the children of deceased without it leading to an inheritance tax liability. ‘This reflects the concern raised by the public about rising house prices increasingly leading to estates with a modest house particularly in London and the South East paying inheritance tax.’ Chancellor: George Osborne’s proposal is expected to become a key part of the Tory manifesto, but will not be included in tomorrow’s Budget after it was blocked by the Lib Dems (file picture of Mr Osborne in 2014) A senior Tory source blamed the leak of ‘old advice’ on the Lib Dems, adding: ‘They are desperate. There is nothing in the Budget on inheritance tax, which we have said repeatedly is an election issue.’ Another senior Conservative added: ‘Usually at this time we get leaks of what’s in the Budget. This is a leak of what’s not in the Budget.’ It is thought that the Lib Dems leaked the papers ahead of the Budget in a bid to paint to Tories as the party of the rich. The number of people who own a home worth more than £1million has risen dramatically, up 50 per cent since before the financial crash. A survey by property website Zoopla last year predicted that there would be 500,000 people owning a seven-figure property by 2015.

McArthur was booked early in the second half of the Barclays Premier League clash at the Britannia Stadium for simulation having taken a tumble in the box. And Pardew told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday programme: 'He dived. 'He should be embarrassed. He's a great professional and that's unlike him. I was surprised but it shows what pressure does to players. Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur (left) was booked for diving in the second-half against Stoke City . Alan Pardew told Sky Sports' Goals on Sunday programme that MacArthur should feel 'embarrassed' 'I haven't spoken to him about it but I don't need to. He will see the replay and he will be embarrassed.' The win continued Palace's resurgence under Pardew, who took over in January after leaving Newcastle. Having been in the relegation zone at that point, the Eagles are now 11 points clear of it and up to 11th place - one spot above Newcastle. Pardew had a rocky relationship with the Tyneside club's fans and when his Newcastle side were beaten 1-0 at Stoke in September, several of the away supporters held up signs calling for him to be sacked. However, following a much happier return to the Potteries for the 53-year-old on Saturday, he insisted it was of no real significance to him that Palace had leapfrogged Newcastle in the table. And Pardew also indicated he is not about to take anything for granted in terms of survival. Palace - with 19 points from 10 league games under Pardew so far - have a total of 36, and he said: 'I'm still thinking about another couple of points. Stoke City forward Jonathan Walters (left) hassles Palace's Joel Ward (right) for the ball on Saturday . Palace winger Wilfried Zaha (right) celebrates scoring his side's second goal with team-mate Glenn Murray . 'But nine wins (for Palace in the league over the season) going into this international break - I would have absolutely jumped at that when I arrived.' Asked if there was any significance for him to going above Newcastle, Pardew said: 'No, not really. 'The most important thing for me is that this club is within touching distance of Premier League status for next year. 'That is the only agenda I had when I arrived. We have done absolutely brilliantly. 'It (his previous visit to Stoke) was a difficult night, and I've had them as a manager. You have to show your mettle.

Stoke midfielder Steven N'Zonzi (left) dribbles the ball away from Palace's Jason Puncheon (right) Stoke, 10th on 42 points, are looking this season to better their Premier League records set last term of a ninth-placed finish and 50-point total. Saturday's result made it back-to-back defeats and manager Mark Hughes is keen for an impressive campaign not to fizzle out. He did, though, stress he thought the Potters' performance against Palace had been an improvement on the previous weekend's loss to West Brom. 'I thought performance-wise it was a marked difference from last week, which was pleasing, but we haven't got a positive result,' Hughes said. 'We are disappointed - we made mistakes, so maybe we didn't do enough to win. 'But we certainly deserved to take something out of it.'

The top-secret SS documents, much of which are written in coded German, are said to offer proof Adolf Hitler used his own towns and cities to test the scale of the devastation caused by the ballistic missiles .

The incredible archive is made up of reports which were only issued to 'Kommandostelle S', a unit so secret that hardly anything is known about it . Deadly: A V-2 rocket launched in Germany from a fixed site in the summer of 1943 . They show how the desperate Nazis used their own settlements as targets while developing the deadly weapons during World War Two. It means thousands of Germans died at the hands of their own leader in 1944 and 1945 - who then blamed the carnage on Allied Forces. The V-2 rockets - the V standing for Vergeltungswaffe, or Vengeance Weapon - were fired at London and the south east of England, as well as targets on mainland Europe, killing over 7,000 people. The warheads were launched in the final months of the war as Britain advanced closer to victory and were considered Hitler's last role of the dice. However, it is widely agreed that if the Nazis has developed the rockets sooner they may have won the race to develop the atomic bomb and gone on to win the war. The V-2 rockets - the V standing for Vergeltungswaffe, or Vengeance Weapon - were fired at London and the south east of England, as well as targets on mainland Europe, killing over 7,000 people . The documents show that Hitler fired V-2 rockets from a test centre in what was then Pomerania into surrounding cities, killing his own people . Royal Air Force reconnaissance photograph of V-2 rockets at a test stand . The remarkable archive was rescued from the flames at the end of the conflict and has remained in the possession of a German collector ever since. Now it is set to go under the hammer at Chiswick Auctions, in London, on March 18, where it is expected to fetch £2,500. On Wednesday, Chiswick Auctions spokesman Richard Westwood-Brookes said: 'The V-2 was the first truly ballistic missile which might have brought victory to Hitler had he won the race to develop the atomic bomb in 1945. 'A note which comes with the archive from a researcher indicates that these were final test firing reports for the rockets and were issued in very limited numbers of no more than 10 to 12 copies. 'The present archive could prove to be a highly important new source of information on what was by far the most important technological and scientific development to have come from the Second World War. 'The V-2 was the first real ballistic missile. Its effects were devastating. Powerful: The first V-2 attack on Britain hit Chiswick in London in September 1944 and left a gigantic crater . 'Had Hitler been successful in developing the technology of the atomic bomb then he would have had the capability of firing it long distances. 'With the use of this rocket - unquestionably this would have led to the Nazis winning the war.' The document, which is typed on sheets of A4 paper, shows a large number of V-2 rockets were fired from the Peenemunde region where experimental devices were tested. They were fired against the Allies with missiles claiming thousands of lives in London, Antwerp and Liege. But shockingly, the reports also reveal many of the original test firings were at German towns and cities - mainly in the area of Pomerania. It is believed special units were then sent to evaluate the extent of the damage caused and report back to the Fuhrer about their effectiveness. Mr Westwood Brookes added: 'Perhaps the most remarkable fact which comes from these papers is that many of these test firings were fired at German targets. Devastation: A V-2 rocket attack left this block of flats in Limehouse, London, in ruins . 'This is evidence enough of how desperate the Nazis were becoming after D-Day and the relentless advances of Allied forces across Europe. 'Many of these test firings at German towns and cities resulted in considerable casualties and substantial damages to houses and other properties. 'I have never seen such concrete evidence to substantiate that Hitler actually used his own towns and cities as target practice.' After the war the majority of V-2-related documents were  destroyed by the Germans before the Allies moved in by orders of the SS. Mr Westwood-Brookes said: 'The fact that several of the sheets in the present archive have clearly been in a fire suggests that these very papers were rescued from such destruction. 'This really is an exceptionally rare find and one that offers a chilling insight into Hitler's war efforts during his final months.' The V-2 rocket was developed by Wernher von Braun, a German aerospace engineer and space architect. He was a member of the Nazi party but after the war went to work in America for Nasa and eventually helped develop the technology that put man on the moon in 1969. The V-2 was the most advanced weapon used in the war until the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Launched from mobile units, the 46ft (14m) tall rockets were powered by liquid ethanol and oxygen and weighed almost 13 tonnes, fully fuelled. The V-2s were also Hitler's answer to his country's disappointment that the V1s (or doodlebugs) didn't knock Britain out of the war. They were launched vertically and could travel at 3,335mph to hit targets more than 200 miles away, making it the world's first long-range combat-ballistic missile.","Most of the top-secret documents are written in coded German .

Lubitz is believed to have deliberately crashed the Germanwings A320 Airbus into a rocky ravine of the Alps, locking the pilot out of the cockpit as he put the plane into a descent - killing all 149 people on board and himself. The 27-year-old was said to be a keen glider and an ambitious pilot, with hopes to continue his career by handling larger planes that carried hundreds of passengers. Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz was an ambitious pilot who wanted to fly even larger planes, such as a Boeing 747 which carries almost 700 passengers, and could have ended in tragedy for even more people . Fellow pilot Frank Woiton flew with Lubitz three weeks ago and said he was confident with his performance to leave him in charge of the controls. He told German newspaper Bild: 'He talked about his training and how happy he was. He said that he wanted to fly long-haul and become a captain. He had mastered flying and was in control.' Mr Woiton, who comes from Lubitz's home town of Montabaur, said the young pilot had told him he dreamed of flying Boeing 747s and an Airbus A380. Boeing 747 planes are large capacity aircraft, often referred to as a jumbo jet. They have a maximum capacity of 660 passengers. Airbus A380 are also considerably larger than the 180-capacity doomed A320 jet that Lubitz flew. Standard A380 planes carry 544 passengers but larger versions can carry up to 800. Recordings from the one recovered black box have revealed the final moments of the plane, as the pilot desperately tried to get back into the cockpit after being locked out by Lubitz. Lubitz harboured ambitions to fly a 747 jumbo jet (left) - larger than the doomed A320 airbus (right) he flew . A fellow pilot revealed that Lubitz also wanted to fly an A380 airbus - which carries more passengers . Captain Patrick Sondheimer apparently screamed ‘Open the goddamn door!’ as he tried to break down the door and get into the cockpit. His shouts are followed by screams from passengers, according to a transcript published in Bild. Investigators are trying to determine what led Lubitz to deliberately crash the plane, with a torn up sick note for the day of the crash, and medication found at his home suggesting he was suffering with psychological problems. He is also believed to have been struggling with apparent vision problems and was concerned it could affect his dream job as a pilot. Members of the Red Cross and residents living close to the site of the crash paid tribute to those killed . Dozens of flowers have been laid in Vernet, France, to honour the victims of the Germanwings disaster . Lubitz is believed to have sought help with his vision problems as recently as March 10. Police have revealed they found evidence at his home to suggest he suffered from a serious 'psychosomatic illness.' His former girlfriend described him as an erratic and controlling man, who would frequently wake up with nightmares. In a chilling premonition she said he once told her ‘One day I will do something that will change the whole system, and then all will know my name and remember it.’ Lubitz is believed to have been suffering from vision problems and was concerned it would affect his flying . As a child, Lubitz is said to have always wanted to be a pilot and covered his bedroom walls with pictures of planes and collected model aircraft. He is also said to have visited an airfield just 30 miles from the site of the tragic crash with his gliding club as a child. Among the 150 victims of the crash were 16 German children from the same exchange class at school and three Britons - one of which was just seven months old. German officials have announced there will be a ceremony on April 17 in Cologne Cathedral attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and senior officials from other countries including France and Spain.","Andrea Lubitz  deliberately crashed an Airbus A320, killing all passengers .

Despite results from a global study showing that hotel guests like to sleep naked  on holiday - it seems romantic liaisons are not top of the agenda in hotels. Of the 39 per cent of people who say they are happy to sleep in the nude on holiday, the nationality most likely to wear their birthday suits in bed is the the French - followed by Britons and Norwegians. Brits on holiday prefer to watch TV or read than have sex whilst in a hotel on holiday, according to a survey by Hotels.com . 1. Watching TV 67% . 2. Reading 47% . 3. Sex 46% . 4. Surfing the internet 40% . 5. Eating from the room service menu 20% . The recent survey asked over 250,000 guests about their holiday habits to surprising results. For Britain, catching up with TV or a movie was the best loved bedroom activity with 67 per cent of people grabbing for the remote when they hit the sheets. Even reading was preferred to romance, with 47 per cent of people enjoying books, and only 46 per cent opting to have sex when they are away. Even if it is not our top pastime time, it does still beat  surfing the internet (40 per cent) and only a fifth of us would rather order a snack from room service. Carolina Annand, of Hotels.com, said: 'It seems on a global scale a lot of us are more than happy to strip for the sheets, yet it is interesting to see in the UK that we prefer to watch TV on a hotel bed rather than any other activity. 'With such a variety of hotel rooms to discover across the globe, both international and domestic, we encourage travellers to really make themselves at home whenever they travel!' A third of us enjoy sleeping in the nude, which is said to have many health benefits including lowering blood pressure . France 51% . UK 24% . Norway 24% . Sweden 20% . Australia 19% . Finland 19% . Denmark 18% . Canada 17% . Netherlands 16% . Ireland 16% . Russia 16% . Brits may love watching TV over making love, but we came in joint second place for the countries who sleep in the nude, with 24 per cent admitting they ditch their pajamas. Norwegian and Swedish travelers similarly enjoyed to bare all with a fifth or more people admitting to sleeping in just a sheet. The benefits of sleeping naked have been promoted by many medical professionals. 'The advantage of sleeping naked is it's easier for the body to cool and maintain the lower temperature the brain wants to achieve,' says Dr Chris Idzikowski, director of the Edinburgh Sleep Centre and author of Sound Asleep: The Expert Guide To Sleeping Well. 'If anything prevents that decline in temperature, the brain will wake itself up to see what's going on, meaning you'll struggle to get to sleep or you'll have disturbed sleep,' he said. Marilyn Monroe was famously not a fan of wearing pajamas and said she only wore Chanel No 5 between . The survey also revealed the calming impact holidays have on our dreams. 42% of Brits said dream differently while on holiday with over a quarter (26%) saying their dreams are more relaxing, while 50% of those in Mexico also had calmer dreams, topping the global list. This was closely followed by Colombia (48%) and Taiwan (45%) in 2nd and 3rd place respectively.","More Brits would rather watch TV than make love while on holiday .

Axel Witsel and Domenico Criscito were on target for Andre Villas-Boas' side at the Stadion Petrovskij as Marco Benassi was dismissed in the first half for the visitors. Zenit have not progressed beyond this stage of a European competition since they won the UEFA Cup back in 2008 but will be clear favourites heading to Turin next week for the second leg. Axel Witsel celebrates after opening the scoring for Zenit St Petersburg against Torino on Thursday . Marco Benassi is sent off after just 28 minutes after picking up his second yellow card .

The Russians returned from a two-and-a-half month break in competitive football at the end of February and came into Thursday's match with three straight wins without conceding a goal. Zenit controlled the early exchanges, dominating possession as Torino defended deep. The Italian's already difficult task became harder when, on just 28 minutes Benassi walked. The midfielder was cautioned as early as the 12th minute when he pulled back Hulk as the Brazilian attempted to spring a counter-attack, before naively challenging Witsel to earn a second booking. The hosts eventually took the lead in the 38th minute. Belgium midfielder Axel Witsel pounced inside the penalty area when Torino failed to clear after Daniele Padelli could only parry an Igor Smolnikov effort. Salomon Rondon thought he had doubled the advantage before the break when he turned Witsel's pass into the net, but it was correctly ruled out for offside. Belgium international Witsel is mobbed by his team-mates after giving Zenit the lead in the first half . Domenico Criscito is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling the Russians' advantage . After the restart Hulk should have increased the lead. After a neat one-two with Danny the former Porto forward fired a tame effort that was easily kept out by Padelli. But Zenit were soon celebrating again as Italian left back Criscito turned home the rebound after Hulk had struck the post.","Zenit beat Torino 2-0 in the first leg of the their Europa League last-16 tie .

But we can settle another long-running geek debate: . Those short, animated loops that have captivated the Web for decades? They're pronounced like a brand of peanut butter. Steve Wilhite created the Graphics Interchange Format, or GIF, while working for Compuserve in 1987. When he received a Webby Award in 2013 for it, and delivered his five-word acceptance speech (that's all the Webbys allow), he flashed a GIF on the big screens at the Cipriani Wall Street in New York. And, in a flash, it all became clear: . ""It's pronounced JIF, not GIF."" Of course, in the grand tradition of heated debate, a flat statement of fact by the creator wasn't enough to sway some partisans. On Twitter, ""GIF"" became a trending topic as some folks pushed back. ""Graphics Interchange Format. Graphics. Not Jraphics. #GIF #hardg,"" wrote Web designer Dan Cederholm. ""So instead of GIF, we've got to say JIF? YEAH RIGHT,"" chimed in October Jones, creator of the ""Texts From Dog"" Tumblr and book. ""And I suppose those animals with long necks are called 'JIRAFFES.'"" And, of course, the peanut butter brand was getting lots of free publicity along the way. The always amusing HAL 9000 account (yes, somebody tweets as the robot from ""2001"") posted an ""animated JIF"" -- which is to say, a swirling, animated jar of the tasty, high-protein spread. Animated GIFs were a staple of the early Internet. Remember The Dancing Baby? That's a GIF. They fell out of favor as more advanced graphics technology emerged. But in the past couple of years, the Web has remembered how much fun it is to watch ridiculous things happen over and over again. Wilhite has argued for the soft-G pronunciation for years. Yet no less an authority than the White House has posted an image on its Tumblr feed advocating for the hard-G. And the Oxford English Dictionary says both pronunciations are acceptable. So, here's wishing Mr. Wilhite ""Jood Luck.""","GIF creator: It's pronounced ""JIF""

""I screamed and called out to the whole family that there was a huge snake on the street,"" Petersen said . The family attempted to hose the python out of the piping, to no avail. With a neighbour's advice, they then took to spraying it with a small dose of vinegar which irritated the snake enough to slither out of the bonnet. It moved toward another elderly neighbour's home to whom she warned of the incoming but were not phased as pythons were a regular occurrence in Davidson. Petersen said her family were very curious about the snake while she was less impressed. The Danish family were fascinated by the python as snakes were not a frequent occurence .

Here are the top 10 quotes from that brilliant interview. Aston Villa spoke to Sportsmail's Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel in an exclusive interview this week . Sherwood on his leadership qualities . ‘I think I can be a leader of men, but you’re not born with that attitude. In the maternity ward, it’s not girls, boys and natural leaders. You have to become that.’ Sherwood on his touchline antics and emotional nature . 'I could try acting. I could sit down and make little notes and everyone would say I’ve matured. But I know that’s impossible. I can’t imagine being any different 500 games in. People thought I would calm down as a player, but I didn’t. The day I retired I was the same lunatic that made his debut for Watford in 1987. I can’t believe the other managers are not as emotionally involved as I am, either. I think they’re all like me inside. Sherwood says he can't believe other managers are not as emotionally involved as he is . Sherwood on his Aston Villa side . ‘We’re like Everton. I don’t think we’ve got a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle. We can’t be the Crystal Palace of last year, or the West Brom of this year. Digging in, blood and thunder, lump the ball in, protecting a lead, that’s not us. Our squad is better on the ball, they’re more suited to pushing for a place in the Europa League. Sherwood on his players stepping up . ‘The players have a duty, a responsibility to fix this mess. I don’t want to hear crap about how difficult it is to play at home. Playing for a big club comes with pressure. Anyone can do it for a lesser team — but you have to have b******s to play for Aston Villa. This is a big club. 'Aston Villa are like Everton... they're not a group of players who are cut out for a relegation battle' Sherwood on not listening to criticism . ‘When I was at Blackburn there were times when it was difficult. My name would be read out and there were a few groans. I didn’t care. I’d sometimes tell David Batty, “I’ll give it away more times than you’ll get it this afternoon.” Sherwood on Nabil Bentaleb . ‘I’d watched him in training. Every day was like his last on earth. He would cry if he lost a five-a-side. He played and never looked back. Sherwood says he loved the way Nabil Bentaleb 'played and never looked back' last season at Tottenham . Sherwood on telling Redknapp to take Bale off in the San Siro . ‘Harry’s going mad. “Get f****** Gareth off?” he says. “He’s the only f****** chance we’ve got.” He keeps him on, he scores a hat-trick, gets us back to 4-3 and if it goes another 10 minutes, we win. The kid’s career springboards from that performance. Sherwood on playing with passion . ‘The coaches used to call me Tackler Tim, or some rubbish. One day, I put one in and he said to Graham Taylor, “Why’s he keep doing that?” I’ve never forgotten his answer. “Brian, you know that shirt you wear on Saturday?” he said. “That’s the shirt he wants.” He was right, too. Take a player like Jack Grealish. I’ve had lots of chats with Jack. He knows what I think. I tell him: “I will take desire over ability every day”. Obviously, the ability can’t be too low. But if you have the ability — and he has — you’ll make it if you have desire. Sherwood says you must have the desire and talent to make it at the top these days . The young manager was appointed last month to attempt to save Aston Villa's season . Sherwood on managing players . ‘So I didn’t come in here all guns blazing or wanting to be their headmaster. You can’t get personal these days, get your hair cut, and all that nonsense. You’ve got to move with the times. I left the stick at home, and the tickling brush. Now I feel I know them a bit better. Some get a whack, others a tickle. Sherwood on Tottenham . ‘I don’t want to be scrapping around; I want to take them forward. I think I did that at Tottenham. I didn’t leave a crumbling house — Mauricio Pochettino has done a good job, but he had it laid out for him, with players like Kane and Bentaleb.

Normally one of the hottest tourist tickets in town, the home of Michelangelo's celebrated ceiling frescoes closed its doors early to regular visitors to enable the group of around 150 street-sleepers to be shown around the chapel and adjoining Vatican museums and gardens. In an unannounced visit, it was the pope himself who welcomed the group to the Sistine Chapel, taking the time to greet each of the visitors.

He requested that no pictures were taken of him doing so . 'This is a house for everyone, this is your home. The doors are always open to all,' the Argentinian pope told them. 'Pray for me, I need the prayers of people like you,' he added. The pontiff had asked that there be no pictures of the meeting.

Aid worker David Haines, of Yorkshire, was beheaded last September after being captured by Islamic state. Alan Henning, 47, a father-of-two, was killed in the same way a month later. On Wednesday, Pope Francis met the families of the two men at a service aimed at uniting religions and ending extremism. Widow Barbara Henning was brought up to meet the Pope on the steps of St Peter's Basilica in Rome. Usually such access is reserved for visiting prelates. Michael Haines, brother of David Haines, was also able to meet the Pope at the ceremony. To mark his 78th birthday in December, Pope Francis ordered the distribution of sleeping bags across Rome and some homeless people have been recruited to hand out copies of the gospels to the faithful attending Sunday audiences at St Peter's.

The 19-year-old, enjoying a prolific season for club and country at youth level, dusted himself off to fire home and draw Aidy Boothroyd’s side level in the match. They had fallen behind three minutes after half-time when Ramirez found himself totally unmarked to sidefoot a low cross past England goalkeeper Christian Walton. This encounter, under floodlights at The Hive, home of Vanarama Conference promotion hopefuls Barnet, was the first in a double-header this week, with the United States lying in wait in Plymouth on Sunday. Mexico, who won the CONCACAF Under 20 Championship in Jamaica in January, booking their spot at the Under 20 World Cup in New Zealand later this year, were always going to provide stiff opposition.

Akpom (England) SCORED 2-0 . Aguirre (Mexico) SCORED 2-1 . Grimes (England) SCORED 3-1 . Guzman (Mexico) SCORED 3-2 . Robinson (England) SCORED 4-2 . England started positively but the first chance fell to Mexico, who moved the ball slickly on the counter-attack all night and often favoured a cross-field ball to catch out the home defence. Daniel Rios collected the ball on the edge of the area, traded passes with Diego Gama, before firing in a shot that goalkeeper Christian Walton blocked with his body. England’s first sniff of goal fell to Arsenal’s Chuba Akpom, having his best campaign yet on the fringes of Arsene Wenger’s first team, but his daisy-cutter from range lacked power. One of those cross-field pings almost caught England out on 19 minutes when the impressive Luis Marquez found Ramirez wide on the left. Instead of looking for options centrally, he shot from a tight angle and Walton gathered. Nottingham Forest midfielder Ben Osborn pinged a shot a couple of feet wide of the post but Mexico enjoyed the best chance of the half just after the half-hour. An inswinging corner from Marquez was met by Gama, who had burst to the near post, but his header crashed back off the crossbar with Walton beaten. The game changed when Mexico goalkeeper Raul Gudino upended England's Chuba Akpom . The goalkeeper was shown a straight red card and Akpom converted the subsequent penalty .

Two minutes after that, Leicester City man Jack Barmby lost out to Marquez in a battle for the loose ball and the Mexican wasn’t too far away of steering a low shot inside the far post. It didn’t take long for Mexico to find the breakthrough in the second-half. From their first attack, the ball was worked quickly across from the right wing and there was Ramirez, completely unmarked, to sidefoot past Walton from close range. It was a frustrating goal to concede and Mexico offered little respite. The half-time substitute Irving Lozano curled a shot just over and the visitors looked the more likely to score. Boothroyd introduced one Chelsea man for another when John Swift came on for Lewis Baker, while Matty Grimes of Swansea City replaced Osborn. Slowly, England started to carve out chances and a mazy run down the left from Barmby saw him fire across the face of goal. Their reward would soon arrive through Akpom and he could have won it but struck the outside of the post late on.

Coach Aidy Boothroyd (right) delivers a talk to the England players ahead of the penalty shoot-out . Coach Boothroyd said: 'It was a tough game, they are a very good side. We only showed in flashes what we're all about individually and as a group. 'I thought they were by far the better team first half, we played a little more brave in the second-half and towards the end there was only one team that was going to win the game. 'But it certainly was a hard-fought one and we were up against the ropes at times. 'We tried out a new system tonight because of the lack of availability of our wide players and we might need to go to Toulon and play that.

And because it connects with Twitter, users already have a dedicated audience. Meerkat effectively turns your phone into a portable webcam and lets you live stream whatever you point your handset's camera towards. It has a simple premise: press the Stream button, point the phone's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account . The app was built by architecture student Ben Rubin and was on display at this week's SXSW Festival in Austin. It has a simple premise: press the Stream button, point the phone's camera at a scene and a link to stream is automatically tweeted from a connected account. There is also a Schedule button to start recording at a later time. This tweet is posted with a [LIVE NOW] message. An optional #meerkat tag is added to the end of the tweet to make it easy to find. That user's followers can reply and retweet the link, to get more people involved, and watch it through the app or on a desktop browser. So far, streams have included US chat show host Jimmy Fallon rehearsing a monologue for The Tonight Show and live streams of sports. Other more mundane, and in some cases disgusting, streams have included people riding on a bus or even picking their nose . Notably, some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user's TV.

The top searches on Twitter include  #meerkat and #meerkat live sports  (shown) So far, streams have included US chat show host Jimmy Fallon rehearsing a monologue for The Tonight Show, Spotify streaming a live spin class with DJ and live streams of sports. When Meerkat first launched last month it imported a user's Twitter followers as well as showed who they were following. However, this was said to have annoyed Twitter and the social network cut off Meerkat's access to this service. Twitter recently bought a live-streaming service called Periscope which is a direct rival to Meerkat. Meerkat has found a way around this though by adding a search feature that lets users find their favourite Twitter users. Notably, some of these sports streams have been live from the event while others have simply been a live stream of the sport on the user's TV. This means that people who can't afford a cable TV subscription, for instance, could watch a game through someone's Twitter feed. The top searches on Twitter include and #meerkat, #meerkat live sports. It is unclear how this would affect licensing and broadcasting laws and MailOnline has asked a lawyer and broadcasters for comment. Sky told MailOnline that it: 'focuses on preserving the value of its investment in sports broadcasting rights and, as part of this, will monitor new technologies and digital distribution methods that become available. 'We work closely with our rights holder partners to, where appropriate, address unauthorised use.' Other more mundane, and in some cases disgusting, streams have included people riding on a bus or even picking their nose. The app promotes itself as a tool for citizen journalists to broadcast live footage of news events, for example. This cuts out the need to film a video and upload it to YouTube, for example. Mr Rubin told Business Insider his favourite use of the app was live BBC reporting from protests in Ferguson. There is no limit on the length of stream but once the stream has ended it is automatically removed from Meerkat's servers - similar to jhow Snapchat works. This means the stream is saved on the user's phone but can't be accessed on the cloud via the link. The app promotes itself as a tool for citizen journalists to broadcast live footage of news events, for example. This cuts out the need to film a video and upload it to YouTube, for example. At the moment the free app is only available on iOS (pictured) but Mr Rubin has said the team is working on developing an Android version .

Everything that happens on meerkat happens on Twitter. Streams will be pushed to followers in real time via push notifications. People can only watch it live. No reruns. Watchers can restream any stream to their followers in real time. Scheduled streams will be distributed in the community by their subscribers. Your own streams can be kept locally on your phone, but never on the cloud. Everyone can watch on web. But people could use screen capturing software during the stream if they wanted to record and keep it. And, in theory, the app raises privacy concerns especially if live footage features people being filmed either surreptitiously or by accident without permission. There is also the wider issue of hacking. If a hacker was able to take control of a user's phone and camera they could use the service to live stream any footage they wanted. Of course, this is an issue that affects a wide range of apps, and not just Meerkat, but its immediacy and live nature highlights the problem more than on other services. There is also potential for pornographic footage to be streamed. Meerkat's terms of service doesn't address this directly but explained: 'You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. 'The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the Services and through third party services and websites.

Exclude assumptions, generalizations, opinions, interpretations, or non-essential details.",9,"The estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling turned her romantic rival's words against her in court Friday, playing a recording that showed her husband showered V Stiviano with millions of dollars in gifts. In closing arguments in the trial seeking the return of more than $2.8million in community property the Sterlings acquired over six decades of marriage, Shelly Sterling's lawyer relied on the words of Miss Stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy. ‘The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,’ Stiviano said in snippet. ‘That's it, that's over. End of case,’ attorney Pierce O'Donnell said. Testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court wasn't as clear-cut even after Sterling's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks Donald Sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of Stiviano's $1.8million Spanish-style duplex near Beverly Hills. Scroll down for video . Back in court: V. Stiviano, 32, pictured here arriving at Los Angeles Superior court Friday, painted two conflicting portraits of Donald Sterling, saying he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but was a 'bigot' who was mean to others . A trick up her sleeve: Donald Sterling's wife, Shelly, had her lawyer play a recording in court Friday that showed her husband showered V Stiviano with millions of dollars in gifts . While an accountant for Sterling conservatively estimated that Stiviano got more than $3.6million in Sterling gifts that included a Ferrari and Paris shopping spree, O'Donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $1million in cash, saying the lower figure lined up with Stiviano's own admissions on the witness stand, depositions and court filings. Judge Richard Fruin Jr, who didn't indicate how soon he would rule, had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts. Defense lawyer Mac Nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument. He attacked the credibility of witnesses, particularly Donald Sterling, who had suggested Stiviano got her name on the home title illegally because she was part Hispanic and had buddied up to a Hispanic banker and escrow officer. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2billion. Nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law doesn't allow Shelly Sterling to go after a third party like Stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband. Key witness: Stiviano was called to testify in the non-jury trial of a lawsuit brought by Donald Sterling's wife, which seeks the return of $3.6million . ‘Say he gave $2,000 to a call girl,’ Nehoray said. ‘Mrs. Sterling can't go and try to get that money back. We know that's not how it works.’ In her testimony earlier Friday, Stiviano painted two conflicting portraits of Sterling, saying from the witness stand that he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but was a bigot who was mean to others. She also testified that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children. ‘We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,’ she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature. Shelly Sterling, who accused Stiviano of fraud when she testified Wednesday, has painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and is now out to hurt him. Wife speaks: Shelly Sterling, estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers basketball team owner Donald Sterling, and her attorney Pierce O'Donnell arrive at Los Angeles Superior Court Friday. Mrs Sterling painted Stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts . Stiviano, seen here outside the court Thursday, testified that tolerating Sterling's racist moments was 'part of the job' Stiviano has not disputed Donald Sterling's largesse, though she has quibbled with the sums at stake and has emphatically denied she used sex to manipulate him. She repeatedly testified that Sterling tried to manipulate her. The apparent contradictions finally led Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, to confront Stiviano with the question: ‘Who is the real Donald Sterling?’ ‘The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,’ Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was ‘kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.’ She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family. Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. Platonic relationship: The 32-year-old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the Clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature . She said, he said: Stiviano rejected the idea that she used sexual favors to manipulate the married billionaire and insisted that he was the one who tried to manipulate her . In her testimony Friday, Miss Stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor, and she named a male friend of Sterling's who accompanied them on trips to Dubai, Paris and Thailand. Shelly Sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy, and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises Stiviano. The judge allowed the testimony as Stiviano's lawyer tried to show where large, unexplained checks may have gone from Sterling's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $1.8million duplex, luxury cars, jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman Shelly Sterling asserts was his mistress. Stiviano said she saw cashier's checks given to the man for $800,000 for a 'so-called business deal' involving a property in Los Angeles and a check for $75,000 to reimburse him for the Dubai travel. Stiviano couldn't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase. She has denied that those were her bank accounts, and Sterling's lawyers couldn't make that connection. The 32-year-old witness said she had worked for Sterling's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years, driving him to view real estate or attending Clippers meetings and games together. She said he provided money, but it was not regular income — and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job. 'As long as you're with me side by side, I will take care of everything you need,' she said he assured her. But Stiviano became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement. She said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork. 'I know how he works his trickery,' she said. 'I knew something wasn't right.'","V Stiviano, 32, said that to her Donald Sterling was a mentor and a father, but to others he was 'a con artist, a bigot'... mean and 'despicable'

BBC staff reportedly pleaded with the Simonstone Hall Hotel in the Yorkshire Dales not to disconnect the hotel's electricity supply for planned works after Clarkson overslept following the incident . The following morning the Top Gear presenter slept in while most of the BBC crew checked out and left, a hotel staff member said. The worker, who spoke to Sky News anonymously, said Clarkson was lucky he had not been served cold cereal instead. They said: 'I got a call to say Clarkson was still in his room and wouldn't be down 'til 10 o'clock,' a member of the kitchen staff told Sky News. 'I said, ""Well in that case he'll have to have Weetabix"" because a sign on reception said the electricity would be cut off at half past nine.'

Another petition calling on the BBC to hire Alan Partridge, the fictional broadcaster played by Steve Coogan, as the new presenter of Top Gear has also been launched, with almost 20,000 signatures. The presenter is still scheduled to appear alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond at four live Top Gear shows in Norway on March 27 and 28 and a decision on whether to go ahead is expected soon.

Williams, 55, is currently suspended from NBC without pay as a team investigates claims he lied in reports about the Iraq war and Hurricane Katrina, among others. But prior to the suspension he had agreed to a five-year anchor deal with Nightly News after being persuaded into it with a gift of veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old desk. Brian Williams agreed to a five-year contract after being persuaded by NBC News President Deborah Turness, who gifted him with veteran broadcaster Edward R Murrow's old writing desk . And few years ago, Williams told NBC Universal CEO Steve Burke that he wanted to take over the Tonight Show from Jay Leno. Burke turned down Williams's idea and instead offered him a weekly program called Rock Center, which Williams hoped could evolve into a variety show. Instead, the show ended up mirroring 60 minutes and it was canceled after two seasons, according to New York Magazine. Williams pushed on, however, and went to CBS CEO Les Moonves to suggest succeeding David Letterman. Moonves wasn't interested, sources told New York Magazine. Williams then had to be convinced through lengthy negotiations to become a news anchor by NBC News president Deborah Turness. Though they first clashed - because Williams was used to having the final say over a show's content - the pair eventually warmed to one another. Brian Williams suggested succeeding both Jay Leno (left) and David Letterman (right). CEOs from NBC and CBS turned down his offers . Williams sent Turness a note over the holidays that read, '2015 is going to be our year together', according to New York Magazine. He went on to agree to a new five-year anchor deal, during the same dinner Turness presented him with Murrow's old writing desk. She had found the 1940s desk through a Los Angeles-based antique dealer. And less than two months later, Williams was publicly shamed for a backlog of fictional stories and executives struggled with how to deal with the situation. This comes just after speculations that Katie Couric might be is in talks NBC's incoming chairman Andrew Lack to make a return by replacing Williams on the Nightly News. 'It makes sense (that she could come back) because she is so closely associated with the brand,' a source told the New York Daily News. Lack 'has not made up his mind' as to whether or not Williams will return when his six-month suspension is up, according to New York Magazine's sources. A 'close friend' of Williams said the the magazine, however, that the anchor 'can't wait until he can speak', which he can't do publicly until his suspension ends.","Williams was turned down by both NBC Universal CEO and CBS CEO .

It is in the centre of the Marais – which remains one of the most famous Jewish districts of the French capital. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: The facade of  Jo Goldenberg after it was devastated by an attack . Shocking: The interior of the restaurant after the attack that killed six and wounded 22 others . Five men from the Abu Nidal Organisation, a terrorist group committed to the liberation of Palestine, ran in to the restaurant, unleashing grenades and firing indiscriminately with automatic weapons. Alain Jakubowicz, of the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA, as it is known in France) confirmed a report on RTL radio about the warrants. ‘It gives meaning to justice,’ said Mr Jakubowicz. ‘No criminal, no terrorist can hide.

Leaked Whitehall documents show officials have drawn up a series of options that could be used to further reduce the benefits bill. All the main parties are committed to money-saving welfare reform, but the Conservatives have pledged to make the deepest cuts, taking £12billion out of welfare in the next Parliament. A regional benefits cap, taxes on disability benefits and a limit on child benefit to the first two children could be introduced in a new welfare squeeze . A two-year freeze on some benefits and a lowering of the new benefits cap – the maximum amount in benefits a household can receive – from £26,000 to £23,000 are already on the agenda. The Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests those measures would save £2billion a year by 2017-18. But documents leaked to the BBC also suggested a regional benefits cap, an idea backed by Labour, as one possibility. The £23,000 limit would vary across the country, with the highest sum paid in London, where housing costs are greatest. It is said that limiting child benefit to the first two children for future claimants would save £1billion a year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the proposals were not Tory party policy . The documents also proposed taxing disability benefits – a move that would prove highly controversial. This would mean better-off claimants losing some of their payments, and would save £1.5billion a year. Carer’s allowance could be restricted to the most needy, saving £1billion. And the contributory element of employment and support allowance and jobseekers’ allowance would be reined in. Currently claimants who have paid enough National Insurance contributions can get the benefits with little means-testing. Some 30 per cent of claimants, over 300,000 families, would lose about £80 per week, saving taxpayers £1.3billion. Council tax support, meanwhile, could be incorporated into the new universal credit, which is gradually replacing all the main out-of-work benefits and tax credits. And replacing the industrial injuries compensation scheme with an insurance policy for employees would save £1billion. The Tories insisted that the proposals were not party policy and had been prepared by officials considering all options for the next government, of whatever make-up. ‘It’s wrong to suggest that any of this is part of our plan,’ said a spokesman for Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Labour Work and Pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves, said: ‘These plans were drawn up for Conservative ministers to deliver their extreme cuts plan.

Tiny villages are scattered along the gorge, which rises from the apple and pear orchards and the gray stone riverbed of the valley floor to heights of more than 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) above sea level. Many of these villages, which were bustling communities in the 19th century, now lie abandoned or survive with just a handful of inhabitants. One dead-end road, the D107, winds its way through Prads-Haute-Bleone, passing churches and a campsite that offers a peaceful retreat for summer hikers. But the remoteness -- which appeals to small numbers of holidaymakers looking to ski in winter or take restorative walks through the green hills in the warmer months -- may make reaching the wreckage of the Germanwings plane difficult. Gilles Gravier, director of the tourist office in Val d'Allos, told French newspaper Liberation the crash occurred in a particularly steep spot on the Trois Eveches mountain, and may have been witnessed by skiers on the area's slopes. ""There is no access by road; emergency crews are coming in by air, using helicopters,"" he said. Capt. Benoit Zeisser from the Gendarmerie in the nearby town of Digne told CNN the aircraft was lying in ""difficult terrain."" Sandrine Boisse, the president of the tourism office at the Pra Loup ski resort, said she heard the plane crash and called the police and the local government office to find out what had happened. ""It was about 11 (a.m.) here. I was outside the garage, and we heard a strange noise, "" she said. ""And at first we thought it was an avalanche, but it was strange at this time because it was 11. ""Something was wrong. ... We didn't know what."" Her husband was skiing nearby and saw a plane flying at low altitude, she said. French President Francois Hollande warned ""it will take some hours for the emergency services to reach the crash site."" Photographs posted on Twitter hours after the plane disappeared from radar showed helicopters preparing to take off, and emergency vehicles lining up ready to receive the victims' remains. The bodies of those on board the plane are expected to be taken to the gymnasium at the local high school in Seyne les Alpes, some 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the crash site, which will be used as a temporary morgue.

More than a third (34 per cent) booking health holidays are prepared to spend £500 or more on a trip, with more than half reckoning they will get better deals on fitness activities abroad than at home. Model Gisele Bundchen is a keen advocate of maintaining her exercise routine on holiday . TOWIE's Lucy Mecklenburgh has developed a strict fitness regime that centres on hard work and dedication . With a number of celebrities advocating exercise while on holiday, it seems the old adage of a break involving lounging around may be outdated. Model Gisele Bundchen has shared with her Instagram followers a series of photos of her exercising and performing yoga on the beach, and other stars such as Kelly Brook and TOWIE'S Lucy Mecklenburgh are similarly as strict with their fitness routines. Naked yoga, bootcamps and Nordic Walking are among the activities Britons have attempted, with 30 per cent of those keen on a health holiday seeing it as a chance to tone up and 23 per cent to lose weight. Also, 21 per cent wanted to learn a new skill while 17 per cent wanted to concentrate purely on their well-being. In contrast, boozy group trips only appealed to five per cent of the 2,000 people polled. Pop singer Beyonce (left) and model Miranda Kerr practise some yoga while on holiday .

Each bullet must convey one distinct explicit fact (names, ages, dates, numbers, specific locations, events) exactly as given in the text. Do not include any opinions, interpretations, assumptions, generalizations, or extraneous context.",1,"Early humans are widely regarded as having been voracious hunters whose appetite for meat contributed to the extinction of many of the large mammals that once roamed the planet. However, new research by paleontologists has suggested that our human ancestors may have started out as scavengers rather than the efficient killing machines they are often portrayed as. The findings could help to explain how early humans made the significant shift in their diet to consume meat and became one of the top predators on the planet. Scroll down for video . Homo erectus, pictured in the reconstruction above, needed around 2200 calories a day to survive and could have easily obtained this by scavenging meat left on the carcasses by predatory big cats in Africa at the time . Dr Briana Pobiner, a palaeoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, studied the meat left behind on modern lion kills to estimate whether early humans could have sustained themselves by picking the bones left behind by predators. She estimates that early humans like Homo erectus could have obtained enough meat to provide an entire days worth of energy from the scraps left behind by prehistoric predators. She told Mail Online: 'Early humans would have scavenged carcasses of animals that ranged in size from medium sized animals like wildebeest all the way up to huge extinct elephants, and animals that lived in a range of different habitats from more open grasslands to closed woodlands. 'Probably anything that wasn’t too rotten was fair game.' Lions, like the two eating a zebra kill above, leave large amounts of their kills untouched, meaning there would have been plenty of meat for early humans to scavenge from carcasses left by prehistoric feline predators . She added that early humans probably survived though a combination of both hunting and scavenging. She said: 'I think it was both – probably a combination of scavenging from larger animals and hunting smaller animals. 'One major energetic advantage of scavenging is that you have a really high success rate in the sense that unless a carcass is absolutely picked clean, like what happens after vultures have gotten to it, you’re virtually guaranteed to get some meat and marrow from what’s left. 'With hunting, you can expend a lot of energy and come up empty-handed.' Dr Pobiner found that modern predators leave large amounts of meat on their kills (as shown above) and believes that prehistoric carnivores could have left even more to be  picked clean by early humans . Speaking in a video on the Smithsonian website, she added: 'I've found in some of the fossils I studied that early humans got to these carcasses first and were able to eat the best parts of the animals. 'Sometimes carnivores got their first and early humans probably only got scraps. It has really big implications for a lot of other major changes that happened in human evolutionary history. 'The evolution in meat eating has been linked to an increase in brain size, its been linked to an increase in home range size and maybe the expansion out of Africa. 'Competing with big carnivores you needed sophisticated interaction, communication and other social skills that are another hallmark of being human.' In research published in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner examined the carcasses of carnivore kills on the modern African savanna in Kenya's Ol Pejeta Conservancy. She looked at how much meat was consumed by lions and leopards before measuring what was left for scavengers. She also watched how much meat other large meat eaters like hyenas and jackals left behind once they were finished with a carcass. Dr Briana Pobiner (above) claims to have found evidence that humans butchered carcasses after large predators had eaten meat from the bones first . Speaking to Popular Archaeology she said: 'The site is a great analogue for the kinds of African savanna environments where hominins are thought to have lived. 'This may have been very much like past carnivore communities during the time our ancestors were starting to eat meat from larger animals, when we have evidence that felids — ancient lions, leopards, and three species of sabertoothed cats — lived alongside our ancestors and may have been the dominant kinds of carnivores at this time.' Dr Pobiner found that in modern Africa even a 'defleshed' wildebeest hindlimb killed by a lion could still yield around one kilogram of meat while a zebra hind limb could have two kilograms of flesh still left on it. She estimates that an entire wildebeest or zebra carcass could yield 5kg and 15 kg of meat respectively even after a predator had eaten. This means a wildebeest carcass could provide 2200 calories and a zebra carcass could provide 6080 calories - enough for a small family of Homo erectus. Dr Pobiner said: 'This is enough for the entire daily caloric requirements of at least one Homo erectus/ergaster male, estimated to require approximately 2090-2290 calories per day.' Dr Pobiner says there is also evidence within the fossil record that suggests predators had eaten carcasses before early humans arrived to butcher the animals. Hyenas are the main scavengers of lion kills on the African Savannah but there are few examples of them in the fossil record in areas where  early humans have been discovered and they could have scavenged instead . 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.8 million years ago - The first species in the Homo family appeared . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.9 million years ago - Homo erectus begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . She said that at around the time Homo erectus were alive there were also few species of bone-crunching carnivores like hyenas in Africa. It means that early humans could have instead filled this niche. She said: 'This lack of bone-crunching hyenids would have meant that as early Homo individuals began incorporating more carcass foods into their diets they would have had more access to within-bone resources than is available in many present-day African savanna ecosystems.' She added that sabretooth cats that lived at the time would have been less efficient than modern predatory cats at removing flesh from a carcass. She said: 'The fossil record of modern lions and leopards goes back to about 2 million years, their dietary adaptations would probably have been similar to the living species today. 'Where the difference comes in is with the three species (three genera, actually) of sabertoothed cats that were around when hominins first started eating meat. 'They would have likely left even more meat on carcasses, because their teeth are even more adapted to slicing flesh.' Dr Pobiner said her findings had helped to dispell the idea that early humans would have struggled to find enough meat to survive by scavenging the meat left by larger predators. She said: 'We tend to think of scavenging as second-rate to hunting, somehow a lesser form of acquiring resources from animal carcasses, that scavengers are lower on the hierarchy and only left with piddly scraps. 'This stems from the earliest interpretations, dating back to 1925, of ancient humans as carnivorous, predatory killers based on associated broken animal fossils construed as being used as weapons.’ She believes, however, that more research is needed to understand whether  scavenging provided a dietary stepping stone as our ancestors moved towards eating more meat. Writing in the Journal of Human Evolution, Dr Pobiner said: 'This study supports the hypothesis that passive scavenging from abandoned larger felid kills could have a been a high-yield, though potentially dangerous, strategy for early hominins even without considering within bone nutrients.'","Palaeontologists studied flesh left behind on big cat kills in modern Africa .
The scientists found that the meat left on carcasses could have provided early humans like Homo erectus with enough calories for an entire day .
Large bone crunching animals like hyenas were not common at that time .
This suggests early hominins could have scavenged meat from carcasses .
Researchers say it could have been a key step towards becoming hunters .","- Research suggests early humans may have started as scavengers.
- Study estimates early humans like Homo erectus could obtain enough meat from scavenging.
- Early humans may have survived through a combination of hunting and scavenging.
- Dr. Briana Pobiner studied modern predator kills to estimate scavenging potential for early humans.
- Fossil evidence suggests predators had often eaten carcasses before early humans.
- Timeline of human evolution:
   - 55 million years ago: First primitive primates evolve.
   - 1.9 million years ago: Homo erectus begins to appear in fossil record.
- Lack of bone-crunching carnivores could have allowed early humans to scavenge effectively.
- Sabertooth cats may have left even more meat on carcasses than modern predatory cats.
- Research indicates scavenging might have been a significant strategy for early hominins.
- Further research is needed to understand the role of scavenging in early human diets.",0.675,"Read calmly and analyze the provided text step-by-step, clearly identifying all explicit factual details.

The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival. Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.' Dick Advocaat, pictured here in charge of PSV Eindhoven in 2012, is set to take charge at Sunderland . Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone . Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa . 525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013. 75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30. 3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1. 35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker. 22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City. 14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season. 4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats – currently one point above the relegation zone – avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light. Sportsmail understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season. Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers. Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England. Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat. Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen – who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg – has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham. Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats –  one point above the drop zone – avoid relegation . 'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld. 'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power. 'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then – the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.' Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract – which expires in 2016 – to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable. Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010, will work alongside Advocaat . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light . His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level. Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet. They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa. Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box. The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge. His first home game will be the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle on Easter Sunday.","Dick Advocaat will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season .

Researchers believe the complex of plazas, mounds, a pyramid and dozens of artefacts belong to a civilization which was blooming thousands of years ago and then vanished without a trace. It prompts the tantalizing possibility that they have found the lost civilization known as the White City, which as been the subject of local rumors among tribes people and Spanish explorers around the la Mosquita area of jungle in Honduras for hundreds of years. Some people call it the White City Of Gold, after ancient texts described ivory temples filled with treasure - and western explorers first made reference to it from conquistador Hernando Cortes to King Charles V of Spain in 1526. Since then countless adventurers have scoured the jungle for the ancient civilization, rumored to have enjoyed treasures beyond the wildest dreams of many budding Indiana Jones'. One such adventurer even suggested that the city was in fact known as the White City of the Monkey God, and saw an ancient civilization worship a giant simian deity, symbolized by a large statue. Theodore Morde, writing of his adventures in US  magazine The American Weekly, said that local tribes people told him of the monkey worshiping civilization and went on with even more outlandish suggestions that a monkey from the city. Locals even told him that one 'monkey god' from the city kidnapped a local woman and bred half-human, half-chimp children. The children were then hunted for revenge. Local tribes people also reportedly related the same story to an anthropologist, according to a Honduran media report. Morde said that local people told him of a huge monkey temple inhabited by a civilization known as the Chorotegas, and claimed to have fond evidence of such a place on his expedition in 1939-40. But Morde never revealed the location of his alleged find and killed himself in 1954. Scroll down for video . A sign of history? This block of stone could be a remnant of a temple built in the Lost City of Honduras thousands of years ago . Incredible: The aerial shots taken by National Geographic show luscious forestland where the City Of The Monkey God once thrived . However, despite archaeologists' following attempts to detect man-made structures - whether they be from Ciudad Blanca, The White City of the Monkey God or elsewhere -  have been unsuccessful. Until now. Traveling into uncharted territory last month, a National Geographic team found the mounds of white rubble in the shape of a monkey's skull that experts believe to be thousands of years old. The National Geographic's Douglas Preston wrote: 'The tops of 52 artifacts were peeking from the earth. Many more evidently lie below ground, with possible burials. 'They include stone ceremonial seats (called metates) and finely carved vessels decorated with snakes, zoomorphic figures, and vultures. 'The most striking object emerging from the ground is the head of what Fisher speculated might be 'a were-jaguar,' possibly depicting a shaman in a transformed, spirit state. 'Alternatively, the artifact might be related to ritualized ball games that were a feature of pre-Columbian life in Mesoamerica.' According to Theodore Morde, stone effigies of monkeys lined the approach to the city's central temple, which was built in the shape of the monkey God. He described the myth: 'One day three of the hairy men who looked like great apes walked into an Indian village and carried off three of its most beautiful and pleasing maidens. 'They took the girls back into the caves high in the mountains to live with them and bear their children. 'From this union came, however, not human nor partly human children but the small Urus or monkeys.' Discovery? American explorer Theodore Morde (left) wrote in 1939 that he had discovered the fabled city described by conquistador Hernando Cortes centuries before. Speaking to locals, he learned the city had been a shrine to the monkey God akin to Hindu's Hanuman who is pictured (right) hiding Rama and Sita, two more Hindu deities, in his heart to protect them. The Honduran monkey God is more menacing, he said . The lost city, believed to be full of gold, has merited two names based on legends. Texts cite 'la Ciudad Blanca' or 'the White City' it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and old reports describe elaborately carved white stones. Other reports claim there once stood a giant monkey-shaped temple. There were also tales of a monkey stealing three women in the city and raping them to create half-monkey, half-human babies, warranting the name: The City Of The Monkey God. Either way, it has been sought since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to King Charles V of Spain. It inspired the Dance Of The Dead Monkeys, during which locals roast monkeys over a fire in an apparent act of revenge for stealing their virgins. The first mention of the city came in Hernando Cortes' fifth letter to King Charles V of Spain in 1926, when he wrote that it will 'exceed Mexico in riches'. Historians believe, based on his description, that the city was in the region of Mosquitia - which was then, and remains now, impenetrably dangerous. '…I have trustworthy reports of very extensive and rich provinces,' he wrote, 'and of powerful chiefs ruling over them, and of one in particular, called Hueitapalan, and in another dialect Xucutaco, about which I possessed information six years since, having all this time made inquiries about it, and ascertained that it lies eight or ten days' march from that town of Trujillo, or rather between fifty and sixty leagues. 'So wonderful are the reports about this particular province, that even allowing largely for exaggeration, it will exceed Mexico in riches, and equal it in the largeness of its towns and villages, the density of its population, and the policy of its inhabitants.' Centuries later, in 1939, Theodore Morde rediscovered the site, and learned from locals that it was home to the myth of the monkey God. Writing in the Milwaukee Sentinel on September 22, 1940, apologized to his readers that he could not reveal the exact location other than the fact that it was shrouded by towering mountains, a 'rushing cataract, beautiful as a robe of shimmering jewels, cascading into the green valley of the ruins.' He added: 'More definite location than this I cannot give, because, as I have written, many are they who have sought for the Monkey God's City, attracted by tales of treasure, and we want to find it unmolested on our return journey in January.' His words have been echoed decades later by the Virgilio Parades, director of the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH), who warned the city and the surrounding rainforest could be obliterated in eight years if the government does not rush to protect it, El Heraldo reported. The latest discovery comes after researchers from the University of . Houston and the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) flew . over the Mosquitia region in a small plane shooting billions of laser . pulses at the ground to create a 3D digital map of the topology beneath . the jungle canopy. Compiling . their data, the analysts revealed what appears to be man-made elevation . changes that are thought to show a forgotten city plaza dotted with . pyramids reclaimed by the jungle. According to legend, Ciudad Blanca or the 'White City' is full of gold and has been sought out by explorers and treasure hunters since conquistador Hernando Cortes first made reference to it in a 1526 letter to King Charles V of Spain. Inspired by this legend, cinematographer and Ciudad Blanca enthusiast Steven Elkins sought backing from private investors to pay for the team at NCLAM to use their laser mapping technology to chart the forest floor of Mosquitia. Over the course of a week, the NCALM and University of Houston engineers flew over 60 square miles of forest in their dual-engine Cessna planes. LiDAR's computer-generated images allow researchers to 'see' through the . forest canopy to the ground surface, revealing any evidence of ancient . settlements or human-engineered landscapes. 'The LiDAR point cloud data clearly show the remains of large . settlements that can be characterized as ancient cities based on their . spatial complexity, size and organization,' said  Colorado State University professors Christopher Fisher, who led the research. 'We may never . be able to tell whether any of these are Ciudad Blanca, or whether the . legendary city ever existed, but we can clearly see in the UTL data . evidence that there was a densely settled region with a human modified . environment. 'These conclusions provide important new insights into the . pre-Hispanic settlement of this largely unexplored region.' This was one of the first times that . laser mapping, specifically light detection and ranging (LiDAR) had been . used to locate ancient ruins. Investigation: The University of Houston and National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping team produced this 3D digital topological map which when examined shows a man-made plaza ringed in red . The researchers first flew over the area and captured the treeline (top), and then were able to 'see through'  to the ground below (bottom image) The original uses of the technology were to provide intelligence after earthquakes, military spying and for river erosion detection. Flying above the intended target area, LiDAR operates by sending out 100,000 short laser pulses to the ground each second. The University of Houston and the NCALM team blanketed the Mosquitia rainforest with as many as 25-50 laser pulses every square metre that totaled up as more than four billion shots during the entire project. Ciudad Blanca has played a central role in Central American mythology. Texts cite it as the birthplace of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl and previous reported sightings over the years have described golden idols and elaborately carved white stones, leading to the lost city's name. However, no confirmation of the existence of the city has ever been provided.

During his wildlife conservation visit to China, the Duke of Cambridge visited a photographer to learn about how he managed to capture such close up pictures of wildlife. And when photography enthusiast Xi Zhinong told the Prince he often dressed up as a tree so he could get close to the animals, the second in line to the throne pledged to do the same. Prince William has pledged to dress up as a tree on his next visit to China so that he can go out with photographer and conservationist Xi Zhinong to photograph rare Yunnan Golden Haired monkeys . The Prince said when he next returned to Yunnan Xishuangbanna he would join Xi on a photography exhibition and also don the same disguise to photograph the endangered Golden Haired Monkeys of Yunnan, according to People's Daily Online. It was pledged during the Prince's tour of the Far East, which he used to foster UK business links as well as raise awareness of the dangers of the illegal trade in wildlife. Golden haired monkeys of Yunnan are native to the forests of China and are highly endangered - with less than 2,000 estimated to be living in the wild. While able to withstand plunging temperatures and even snow, the species is in danger because their habitats are slowly disappearing and their distinctive appearance has made them a key target for illegal hunters. Yunnan golden haired monkeys are native to China but they are believed to be less than 2,000 in the wild . They are also something of a mystery because they were first discovered by scientists in the 1890s, then lost and thought to be extinct until 1962. The monkeys are herbivores and give birth every two or three years. China has launched a conservation programme to try and protect the species. Xi Zhinong is a Chinese wildlife photographer as well as an environmentalist. Between 1992 and 1996 Xi went to Baimaxue Mountain National Nature Reserve to raise awareness of the Golden Haired Monkey. He also hoped that by sharing photos of the monkeys and how they lived he could protect the natural habitat of the animals, in a strip of primeval forest. Prince William spoke to photographer Xi about his work and learned how he disguises himself to take pictures . After being discovered in the 1890s the Yunnan Golden Haired monkey did not appear again until 1962 . During his visit, Xi presented Prince William with two photography collections, 'Wild China' and 'The Spirit of Life'. Prince William was in China last week for a wildlife conservation visit. His visit was the highest profile Royal visit since the Queen toured the country in 1986, and gave the Prince the chance to meet wildlife experts and conservationists. He used the tour to condemn the trade in illegal wildlife and products, such as ivory, and called upon China to become a world leader. Golden haired monkeys are in danger because their habitats, mainly forests, are slowly disappearing . Prince William was intrigued by the golden haired monkeys and asked how close-up pictures were possible . Golden haired monkeys are native to China and mainly spend their time in the forest canopy . During his time in the country Prince William visited Beijing and featured on a television campaign organised by WildAid and aimed at raising awareness of the impact of the trade in rhino horn and ivory. The tour ended however with a PR disaster when the Prince was allowed to visit an Elephant rescue centre, just a few yards from an arena where elephants play football, dance and do tricks for tourists. Prince William's visit was also seen as an opportunity to create links between the two countries, and he met President Xi Jinping. The end of Prince William's tour was branded somewhat a PR disaster after he visited an elephant sanctuary yards from where the animals perform tricks for audiences in a type of circus, condemned by campaigners .","Prince William visited photographer Xi Zhinong as part of conservation trip .

He simply has to take part in the tournament, and help the hosts excel, because the final takes place on his mother's birthday and she would like her son to mark it in style! On January 9, Morgan was driving for the line during an Aviva Premiership match at Kingsholm when his season was crudely terminated. He heard the sounds of breaking bone, and when team-mates and opponents moved sharply away as he lay on the ground, he knew he was in real trouble. 'All I remember was that we had a scrum in the left-hand corner, I picked up the ball and went on a usual run,' he told Sportsmail. 'I got tackled by Jacques Burger and having looked back at the clips, I was able to see he wrapped his legs around my leg and I didn't really have anywhere to go. 'At the time, I didn't really know what the hell had happened and I just started yelping. I like to think I wouldn't make those noises unless it was serious! People moved out of the way pretty quickly and even though I wasn't in that much pain, I knew I had done something. Gloucester No 8 Morgan lines up London Welsh fly half Olly Barkley at the Kassam Stadium . 'I just didn't know how bad it was going to be, but I had an immediate realisation that I was going to be out for a while. When I got to the hospital, the staff were pretty guarded, but I got more of a sense of how bad things were when a few hours had passed.' A surgeon from Cheltenham came to the hospital in Gloucester to perform the operation during the night and when the anaesthetic wore off, Morgan sought to put his mind at rest about his predicament. 'When I'd come round, I fired loads of questions at the surgeon,' he said. 'The first thing was 'Is it a career-ender?'. I knew he couldn't be precise, but I needed a ball-park idea of how long I'd be out for and he told me six months.' The damaged leg contained a significant amount of precious metal; to help the healing process. He will have another operation next month to replace a pin with more flexible wire, but a plate will remain in place. Morgan has not yet had a chance to set off airport scanners, but he quipped: 'I'm made of Meccano – don't put any magnets near me!' Morgan is brought to ground by flanker Marcell Coetzee during England's loss to South Africa in November . His self-deprecating humour is part of a philosophical attitude towards the situation he is in. While a home World Cup would be a momentous career highlight, he refuses to agonise about whether his recovery happens fast enough, despite moving heaven and earth to make sure it does. A six-month rehabilitation period would mean Morgan is match-fit by July 10 and wouldn't need to miss any of the training camp which starts just before that red-letter date. But he said: 'If it takes longer, that's just how it is. 'The World Cup is the carrot, but I have to be realistic; if I don't make it, I don't make it. I'm not going to tear myself up about it. I'm doing everything I can to get back for it, but there are certain hurdles I have to clear. I'm quite relaxed about it. I'm pretty sure I'll be back. If I do end up going into the World Cup training camp, I'll be fresh. I'll be blowing out of my a**e, but I'll be fresh!' The recovery programme has conventional elements, with Morgan spending seven weeks in a cast and following up that initial stage with physiotherapy and weight-training at the club. But he is also employing cutting-edge methods to help his leg mend rapidly. Twice a day, four times a week, he spends 90 minutes in a hyperbaric chamber at an MS centre in Gloucester. Morgan makes another powerful ball carry against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . 'The bulk of what I'm doing is oxygen therapy,' he said. 'I'm being pressurised, to simulate being 10 metres below sea level, and I'm breathing pure oxygen. The thinking is that it increases the red blood cells in your blood, which is brilliant for healing. 'I go in the morning, then go to train with Gloucester, get physio and do upper-body weights, then go back to the oxygen chamber. I'm in there for an hour-and-a-half.' To pass the time, Morgan's creative side is emerging, as he is filling up a large sketch-book with pencil drawings. The subjects are wide-ranging. Billy Vunipola regained the  No 8 jersey in Morgan's absence and has started all three Six Nations games . 'I've drawn a few pictures; my dog, my nephew, a little Mickey Mouse, a turtle, a light-bulb,' he said. 'There's also a little lizard, a Ninja Turtle, an owl… I've just ordered some sketching pencils because it's difficult to get good shading with the ones I've been using. I'm stepping it up! 'I did a couple of bits and pieces at school. It's just a bit of fun, a way of passing the time. I'd be bored out of my brain if I wasn't doing something like the sketching.' Morgan was on a roll before his horror injury. He was named England's Player of the Series after the autumn campaign and had usurped Billy Vunipola to reclaim the No 8 shirt before his barnstorming progress was abruptly halted. In recent weeks, instead of being at the heart of the national team's RBS Six Nations campaign, he has been an observer. He will be at Twickenham next Saturday to watch against and is aiming to spend a day at the team hotel, while maintaining contact with the England coaches. Stuart Lancaster will dearly hope to have Morgan involved at the World Cup and the long-term casualty is confident he will be ready. Veteran Harlequins back rower Nick Easter has been another player to profit from Morgan's absence . He said: 'I feel really positive and, hopefully, that positive attitude will help my healing process. Some people get dragged down with really dark thoughts, but I'm staying upbeat. 'Getting back in time is the hardest battle, but then I have to get selected again, which is going to be a very tough task. Nick Easter has done well since coming back in, Billy is playing well too and I'm missing a block of games. Luckily, I ended on a bit of a high, but I'll have had six months out of rugby. Whether that is a good thing, because I'll be fresh, or will count against me, I don't know, but I'll do everything in my power to be there.' If he makes it, he will have a sketch-book full of souvenirs from his rehabilitation – and a chance to give his mum the ultimate birthday present.","Ben Morgan fractured his left leg playing for Gloucester in January .

Mr Hockey says it is due to the aging population in Australia that the role superannuation needs to be reconsidered, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. However the notion has been met with discontent among the Grattan Institute, Labor and the superannuation association, who warn that house prices will rise if the idea was put into place. This comes as the recent release of the Abbott government's Intergenerational Report revealed a snapshot of the next 40 years, showing Australians can expect to live into their mid-90s in 2055. First home buyers may be allowed to spend their superannuation to help them buy a property, Treasurer Joe Hokey has proposed . Mr Hockey said on Friday that the government may have to make fundamental changes to the superannuation system, considering Australia's ageing population. 'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey told the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I am concerned about rising house prices and the accessibility to homes and homeownership for younger Australians, but we've got a limited pool of savings. We need to have these conversations.' However John Daley from the Grattan Institute told the Sydney Morning Herald he was against the prospect, saying that Mr Hockey's proposal would only increase housing costs. 'It won't improve the problem around supply. If supply remains constant and you effectively increase the amount that people can pay then prices will go up. This is economics 101,' Mr Daley said. 'I get a lot of people approaching me saying that young people should be able to use their superannuation to fund a deposit on a home, on their first home,' Mr Hockey said . Shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen was also opposed to the notion as he told the Sydney Morning Herald that it goes against the principle behind superannuation. These views were echoed by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia as they expressed that such a proposal would only help those on higher salaries rather than Australians who earn less. On Thursday, the Abbott government's first intergenerational report was released and found that by 2054/55 there will be about 40,000 people aged over 100 years in Australia. These figures were compared to about 122 Australians aged over 100 in 1974/75 and around 4,000 now.

An evil mother tortured her children to make up sickening allegations about a satanic cult based at a primary school in the midst of a seething child contact dispute, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Ella Draper and her partner Abraham Christie forced her two children to lie about sexual abuse and ritual torture in Hampstead, North London, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. She named and shamed the pair in a written ruling on care proceedings brought by a local council and said their internet campaign about the cult was ‘evil’ and ‘baseless’. The judge suggested the couple may have fed the two youngsters, aged eight and nine, cannabis soup to gain their compliance. More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material and police had to protect worried parents at the gates of Christchurch Primary School where the ‘main action’ was alleged to have happened, the ruling said. The ‘grotesque’ claims against ‘blameless’ people included drugged babies being sent from abroad by courier services such as TNT and DHL to London and then sacrificed. Cult members were said to have drunk their victims’ blood and danced around with the babies’ skulls. At least seven other schools were named, a swimming pool identified as a meeting place and ‘rituals’ were alleged to have been performed at a McDonald’s fast food restaurant. The children’s father Ricky Dearman, whose three-year relationship with Draper ended acrimoniously in 2006, was falsely said to be the leader of the cult, and teachers, police and a priest to be among its more than 100 members. The judge said: ‘Many of those individuals are now living in fear because they have been identified on the internet as abusers of children and their contact details including telephone numbers, home and email addresses have been published. ‘Several of those implicated have received malicious, intimidating phone calls and emails at all hours of the day and night from all over the world. For example – “We’re coming for you. You paedo scum”.’ The two children, who are now in care, were repeatedly named in the internet campaign and films of them uploaded to the internet ‘with flagrant disregard for their welfare interests’. Mrs Justice Pauffley was asked to investigate by social services bosses in care proceedings brought by Barnet council after the two children were said to be at the centre of the cult’s abuse. But the judge said they were in fact forced by Draper and Christie to ‘provide concocted accounts of horrific events’ in filmed mobile phone recordings and to lie to police when interviewed after the allegations were brought to the attention of officers in September last year. The children’s stories came about as the result of ‘relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse’. Internet campaign: More than four million people worldwide have viewed the ‘fantasy’ online material . ‘Torture is a strong word but is the most accurate way to describe what was done to the children by Christie in collaboration with Draper,’ the judge said. ‘Both P and Q have suffered significantly. Their innocence was invaded. Their minds were scrambled. Their grip on reality was imperilled.’ Tests showed they had both also ingested cannabis in the three months before being taken into care. It was impossible for analysts to say if this was via passive smoking or oral ingestion, but both children had described in interview how hemp was made into soup at their home using the juicer, the judge said. Draper took no part in the court proceedings and has ‘not been seen by anyone in authority since February 12’. There are ‘rumours that she has fled abroad’ because she fears being arrested, Mrs Justice Pauffley said. The judge completely cleared Mr Dearman and all others named in the campaign of any abuse and called the material published on the internet ‘nothing more than utter nonsense’. ‘I am entirely certain that everything Ms Draper, her partner Abraham Christie and the children said about those matters was fabricated,’ she said. ‘The claims are baseless. Those who have sought to perpetrate them are evil and or foolish. ‘All the signs are that those responsible for posting material derive a great deal of personal satisfaction from attracting interest to their spiteful work from many thousands of people. ‘It’s akin to the sensation, I imagine, of a Facebook user receiving an indication that some posting or other has been liked.’","Mother forced children to lie about sexual abuse and torture, judge rules .

The midfielder fought back after being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis four years ago but after a lengthy lay-off struggled to keep his place in the national team and at Manchester United. However, the 31-year-old is enjoying a new lease of life at West Brom after joining the Baggies in the winter transfer window and Gordon Strachan asked him to lead out the Scots in Wednesday night's 1-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland at Hampden Park, as recent skipper Scott Brown was rested. Darren Fletcher brings the ball under control during Scotland's 1-0 win over Northern Ireland . 'It was great to be back,' said Fletcher. 'You are representing your country, you are captain, you win a game at home against Northern Ireland, it is things you thought about doing when you were going through tough times. 'It was a while since I played at Hampden, I was thinking that driving in. But I really enjoyed it and the pitch was really good as well. 'Scott wasn't starting so it was my turn to step up and be captain. I have said before, I am what I am now on and captain or not, I am going to be exactly the same. 'We have a lot of leaders in that dressing room which is important. 'There is competition for places which is great. It means I have to step up my performance when I play. 'It is great for the manager and great for the squad that we are all pushing each other and performing well. Fletcher wins a challenge against former Manchester United team-mate Jonny Evans . 'I feel great. I feel stronger with every 90 minutes and I am seeing improvement all the time so hopefully there is more to come as well.' The match served as a warm-up for Scotland's Euro 2016 qualifier against Group D minnows Gibraltar at the national stadium on Sunday and it took a late Christophe Berra header to separate the teams. The Scots are all but certain to move on to 10 points after five fixtures against UEFA's newest member but Fletcher is too long in the tooth to go overboard about qualification hopes. Since making his debut under Berti Vogts in a friendly against Norway in 2003, Scotland have failed six times to qualify for a major finals. He said: 'We have great confidence in ourselves and in the group but I have been in this position before with Scotland and we have not managed to see it over the line. 'Everything we have done up until now has been great but the hard work is still to come. Fletcher was thrilled to be back captaining his country after a long absence . 'You have to keep reiterating that. We have an important match on Sunday. 'Win that and that takes us into the qualifier in June (away to Republic of Ireland) which is going to be an important game but there is still a lot of work to do.' 'We have put ourselves in a great position but the hard work begins now and let's see it out.' Fletcher believes patience on and off the pitch will be key against a Gibraltar side who, after failing to score a goal, far less win a point, in four games, will have damage limitation on their minds. He said: 'Hopefully the fans are patient with us when we are trying to play our football and break teams down. 'They were against Northern Ireland and it is important that they help us as much as they can.","Scotland beat Northern Ireland 1-0 at Hampden Park on Wednesday night .

The procedure - which involves having parts of their vagina cut out and then then sewn back together again - is usually performed before a girl turns 12 and is carried out without anesthetic or sterilised equipment. Many of the girls are too scared to admit they have suffered FGM and can be stigmatised by their community for speaking out. Scroll down for video . Leyla Hussein is an FGM survivor who wants to prevent other girls suffering like she has . But a number of British victims have come forward to talk about their experience - and call for it to be stopped once and for all - in a new documentary for Comic Relief. Recalling the moment she was cut, one of the women Leyla Hussein, 32, from London, said: 'Your whole body is in pain, the scream that you scream meant I lost my voice for a couple of days. 'The moment your genitals are cut, a part of your soul dies.' Another British survivor interviewed for the documentary said: 'I don't think there's any word I can use to describe that moment. They grab you with a woman holding each leg and another holding your head and chest so you can't move.' The practice first began in ancient Egypt and remains a rite of passage in many African and Middle Eastern countries and some parts of Asia. Parents cut their daughters because they believe that this will allow her to be accepted into society and improve her marriage prospects. A girl who is uncut is often seen unclean and sexually promiscuous. The idea that FGM is necessary and makes a woman more virtuous and attractive is so ingrained in some communities that mothers who have endured it themselves - and continue to live with the physical and mental consequences - will still happily arrange for their daughters to suffer the same fate. Nimco Ali was subjected to FGM as a child and said many British girls are at risk . Leyla explains: 'The cutting season in the UK means holidays. If you don't get this done, you won't be married to the right family so your status is questioned.' The anonymous victim added: 'It's a business for the person doing the cutting and the family as once the child has been through FGM, whoever they will marry will pay a higher dowry, it's all about money.' Actress Zawe Ashton, who presents the BBC documentary, flew to Kenya to meet one of the women making money as a result of cutting thousands of girls who are taken to her from around the world. Despite suffering the pain of FGM herself as a child, the elderly cutter said she's happy to cut others - using a pair of sharp scissors she carries around in her handbag. She said families from across the UK, Europe and America travel to Kenya for her services. The cutter said: 'When I had FGM I was cut with thorns, I can still feel it now. Then they used thorns to stitch me back up.' Justifying why she now inflicts this on other girls, she said: 'The girls father gives permission, the mother as well, her whole community gives permission and I get paid.' She added why her community believe FGM to be so important: 'If the girls aren't cut, they will start to love and start to chase men, they should be cut before they are 12 otherwise they will start to get horny. 'Our tradition is to cut them and make them bleed to calm them down. If you don't cut them, they will think about pleasure all the time, they can't help themselves.' Pleasure has been far from the mind of Hoda, 23, a British resident Zawe meets who had type 3 FGM when she was a child. After she was cut, she was sewn back up with and left with a hole no bigger than matchstick that has left her with a host of health problems - and infertile. She said: 'I was seven when I was cut. I remember everything. It happened, I was cut and I got this pain every night, abdominal pain.' Actress Zawe Ashton, right, travelled to Kenya for a BBC documentary to meet Agnes Pareyio, left, the founder of Comic Relief funded project which helps girls escape FGM . Hoda's stomach pains where due to the fact she couldn't have a normal period because of the tiny hole she had been left with. Blood that was supposed to leave her body remained trapped inside causing internal damage. She has had a number of operations to try and restore her health and wellbeing but will never be able to have children. Now married to a man she met in the UK, Hoda said she feels guilty she will never be able to have a family with the man she loves. Leyla also has to live with the mental as well as physical consequences of her FGM. She said: 'I live at home with a panic alarm, I have to carry a personal alarm with me wherever I go, it's difficult.' She added that many people may be surprised to learn she's a victim of FGM because of her western appearance but she said many British girls like her are at risk. She said: 'There's this code of silence, I associate it with the Mafia. We describe ourselves as the ""Topshop FGM"" survivors. We are High Street girls so don't narrow it to one particular image.' The documentary reveals how many are duped into travelling out of Britain when they are young as they are told they are going on holiday or to a party. Nimco Ali, 31, who lives in London, campaigns against FGM after having it done to herself as a child, agreed that the practice is more rife in the UK than people realise. She said: 'Many are afraid to speak out as there is that fear of being judged. Everyone thinks it's not the girl in Manchester, in Cardiff or London being taken away and having FGM but it's exactly these girls, they are not girls who are immigrants or here on holiday. Zawe with some of the children who are being helped by the Comic Relief supported project in Kenya . 'They are the girl at the back of your classroom or the girl you could bump into on Oxford Street but you don't know they have just been through FGM.' The documentary reveals the steps that are being taken to try and stop the practice continuing. In an East London school, FGM workshops are held to educate  young men and women on why it's wrong, while border police operate at airports to try and stop girls they deem to be at risk leaving the country. Nine new Red Nose characters, pictured, are available for shoppers to collect in the run up to Red Nose Day on Friday 13th March. At least 60p from each £1 Nose goes to help transform the lives of some of the poorest and most disadvantaged people in the UK and across Africa. Sainsbury’s is the official retailer of Red Noses and Red Nose Day merchandise . Zawe sees that change is also happening in Kenya where it has also been made illegal and where education is helping to empower girls and break the cycle of FGM. In Narok, Kenya, where up to 95 per cent of girls have undergone FGM in traditional Maasai tribes, one of the world's leading anti-FGM campaigners, Agnes Pareyio, runs a rescue centre for girls who rebel against FGM. The centre gives the girls a safe home, food, clothes and an education. Comic Relief is supporting their fight against FGM as well as those working to end it in the UK. More than 30 grassroots projects have been aided by from Comic Relief - who will push to raise more much needed money this Red Nose Day on Friday.

Do not include any opinions, interpretations, assumptions, generalizations, or extraneous context.",18,"(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to the Congress this week was as eagerly anticipated in Tehran as it was in Washington. The Iranian reaction to the speech has been a combination of indignation and indifference. While some of Netanyahu's remarks are already being exploited by competing factions within the Iranian state, the likeliest impact of the speech is tied to Netanyahu's baseless charge that Iran's vendetta against the Jewish people is an ancient mission. The earliest official reactions were predictably the most vigorous in denouncing Netanyahu's message to the American people. Ali Larijani, the powerful speaker of the Iranian parliament, painted Netanyahu as the leader of a ""tin pot regime"" that is not as concerned about Iran's nuclear program as it is of Tehran's growing regional influence. The hardline Kayhan newspaper, the key official outlet linked to the office of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called the speech ""trash talking"" but it also made sure to use it an ammunition against its rivals in the moderate faction. The paper, skeptical of President Hassan Rouhani's nuclear negotiations with the Americans from the beginning, said Netanyahu's comments present an awkward truth for the pro-negotiation faction in Tehran: the Israeli leader and his American supporters are openly signaling the dispute with Iran can only be resolved once there is a change of regime there. Iranian media coverage of Netanyahu's speech mentioned the controversy in the U.S. around its timing but the hardline outlets warned against reading too much into it. As one hardline newspaper, Khorasan, put it, ""although it is undeniable that Obama and Netanyahu disagree on Iran, the [recent] remarks of the two [leaders] shows that they both seek the same goal."" The idea that the U.S. and Israel share the same strategic goal to rein in Iran but are in disagreement about how to achieve it is the cornerstone of the hardliners' stance in Tehran. The moderate outlets, supportive of President Rouhani, have put a different spin on Netanyahu's speech. Unlike the hardliners, they are not painting the Obama-Netanyahu fallout as some orchestrated good cop-bad cop ploy to maximize concessions from Tehran. Instead, they emphasize that there is a genuine difference in opinion between the U.S. and Israel. The moderate faction sees the controversy around Netanyahu's speech to the Congress and his failure to squeeze the Obama White House to toughen its negotiation terms with Tehran as an indication that Netanyahu is the one who is isolated. The hardliners and the moderates were in full agreement on one point, and that was the delight they shared about the absence of some 60 out of 232 Democratic members of the Congress from Netanyahu's speech. It is too early to gain a good insight into the reaction of ordinary Iranians to Netanyahu's speech. But one aspect of his speech is bound to create backlash among ordinary Iranians outside the corridors of the state: his invocation of festival of Purim, which commemorates the salvation of Jewish people in ancient Persia. The historic event is recorded in the Book of Esther but Netanyahu's characterization implied that the Persian people's history of anti-Semitism and the pursuit of agenda to destroy the Jewish people is an ancient mission. ""Today the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us,"" Netanyahu said. With that line, he put the ruling Islamists in Tehran on par with ruling Persian empires that have come before them. As is already evident in the Persian-language social media, this will not go down well with ordinary Iranians, many of whom are not supporters of the Islamist system in Tehran and will resent the charge of eternal Persian anti-Semitism. They wish Netanyahu had made more effort to distinguish between the Islamist rulers in Tehran -- many of whom undoubtedly harbor anti-Semitic views -- and the people of Iran whose history with the Jewish nation is far more amicable than Netanyahu's portrayal of history suggests. What is more instantly measurable is the impact of Netanyahu's speech among officials in Tehran. The Iranian response to Netanyahu's speech to the Congress is best described as one that reflects the clash of visions between moderates and hardliners in the echelons of power. For the moderates, the controversy around his speech and the cold-shoulder Netanyahu got from the White House is itself a vindication of President Rouhani's gamble on reaching a diplomatic solution to Iran's 12-year nuclear saga. The hardliners have been quick to paint Netanyahu's visit to Washington as an example of the insincerity of the Americans in dealing with Iran, but not even the hawks in Tehran are claiming that Netanyahu's presence in the U.S. Congress is grounds to shift Iran's nuclear diplomatic strategy.","Iranians met Netanyahu's speech with indignation, indifference, writes Alex Vatanka .

Hardliners suggest the speech shows U.S. insincerity but have not argued against talks .","- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech to Congress.

The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali and into Australia. He was jailed for life - later upgraded to a death sentence before being reduced back to life, meaning he will spend the rest of his days as an inmate. Scroll down for video . Bali Nine drug smuggler Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen has spoken for the first time about his life in prison . And he has of course been watching the fate of the condemned Bali Nine ringleaders very closely as he prepares to launch another appeal, knowing full well he risks having the death sentence reimposed by a panel of judges. 'Sitting in my jail cell and watching the way the Indonesian government’s handling their execution, I’m terrified,' Nguyen told The Saturday Telegraph, referring to Chan and Sukumaran. 'I’m terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next.' He also has to deal with the guilt of putting his family through such an emotional ordeal - and the fact they have spent all their savings paying his legal costs. The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005, as the Indonesian Supreme Court increased his sentence to the death penalty in 2006 and then reduced it back to life in prison in 2008. The hardline stance of Indonesian President Joko Widodo has frightened Nguyen to the point where he believes he would not receive a fair trial should he appeal, but is still determined to not give up hope. The 31-year-old was convicted in 2005 for his involvement in a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali . The Indonesian Supreme Court increased Nguyen's sentence to the death penalty in 2006 . The Bali Nine consists of nine Australians who were arrested in Indonesia in 2005 for a plot to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of the country and into Australia . Despite international pressure and official protests from the governments of Brazil, Holland, France, the Philippines and Nigeria, Mr Joko has remained unwavering on the executions. 'No one prefers death. Death is an easy way out. I deserve the suffering I’m going through. But an appeal means hope. Without that hope there isn’t any future,' Nguyen said. His sentiment has been echoed by supporters of Chan and Sukumaran as they wait for the outcome of their last-ditch appeal. The appeals were adjourned until next week, and Australian authorities have continued to negotiate with the Indonesian government for clemency and life imprisonment for the pair. High profile Indonesian authorities have reportedly urged President Joko to reconsider the executions, amid concerns that if the executions go ahead the nation's reputation will be tarnished. 'Cracks are showing. They know that after these executions, there are many more to come,' one source, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fairfax. Nguyen said that the hope of future appeals is what pushes him through each day, though he understands the gravity of his actions. The 31-year-old has been through a legal rollercoaster since being sentenced in 2005 (here with fellow Bali Nine members) 'I’m terrified for their situation, distraught for their loved ones and agonisingly certain I will be next,' Nguyen said of Chan and Sukumaran . Nguyen has  been watching the fate of the condemned Bali Nine ringleaders very closely as he prepares to launch another appeal . H said one of his biggest regrets is the shame he has brought to his family and the heartbreak his situation has put them through. Nguyen has been trying to repair his relationship with them since being convicted almost 10 years ago, and said he is haunted by the memory of his mother coming to visit him for the first time in prison. His parents were given asylum in Australia after fleeing Vietnam and taking refuge in the Philippines, where Nguyen was born. Describing his parents as hardworking and courageous, Nguyen said that he threw away what they fought so hard for and that he will never be able to make it up to them. His parents, who now run a bakery in Brisbane, have also used their life savings to fund his appeals, going into debt in a desperate bid to reduce his sentence. He has launched a fundraising page to ease the financial stress from his parents' shoulders, which he is hoping to put towards his next appeal. Nguyen is currently being held in a jail in Malang, where he shares a cell with fellow Bali Nine drug mule Martin Stephens (above) Nguyen has been in close contact with his friend Scott Rush (above), whom he enlisted as part of the plot .

Nguyen said that it has been terrible to see his friend 'destroy himself'.

Rosberg has been accused of attempting to block Hamilton during qualifying for the Malaysian Grand Prix .

'There are a lot of comments on Twitter saying Nico blocked you. Is it true he blocked you on your second timed lap?' Hamilton replied, smiling: 'I think you should probably ask him. I think he'll have a good opinion on that.' The room laughed, but Rosberg appeared to be annoyed. He shook his head and twice said: 'That's not funny.' Rosberg, going slowly, appeared to stay on the racing line as Hamilton was on a flying lap in the final qualifying session. Hamilton (right) was on a fast lap when he approached the back of Rosberg who had already slowed down . Rosberg (left) remained on the racing line despite his Mercedes team-mate being on a quick lap . Hamilton (right) overtakes Rosberg. It was claimed hat the German had intentionally blocked his rival . But it made no difference because, as it transpired, Hamilton already had pole position sewn up. Rosberg was third fastest. The German was then asked by a reporter if he did indeed intentionally block Hamilton. 'You best ask Lewis about that, he said. 'No, it is not even a relevant discussion because we were both on slow-down laps at that point in time. And that was very, very clear.' Informed Hamilton had set a personal best in the first sector, Rosberg said: 'Yeah, but if you bail out of a lap it turns into a slow-down lap, doesn't it?' It was then suggested to Rosberg that Hamilton only slowed as he came upon the German, to which he said: 'That is not true. He backed off way before coming up on me.' Hamilton mastered the difficult conditions in Malaysia to secure the 40th pole of his grand prix career . The Briton will start ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel as he bids to secure his second straight victory . Although the next question was on a different subject, Rosberg chose not to let the matter drop and remarked: 'How do we make that a fact, that he bailed out before he came across me? 'That is the interesting one because me just saying it isn't going to bear much weight. So, we need to think of one, which I don't have an answer for to make that a fact for you. I will have to think about something later on. Or you can ask Toto (Wolff, Mercedes motorsport boss) who is coming. That is maybe a good one. That will give some more weight to it.' Unfortunately for Rosberg, Wolff was unavailable for his session, and so could not offer an opinion. It is not the first time Rosberg has been accused of blocking Hamilton in qualifying. At last year's Monaco Grand Prix, Rosberg appeared to scupper his team-mate's best shot at pole by deliberately running off the circuit.

Dr Aric Sigman believes men are an 'untapped army' in the fight against body dissatisfaction who could offer a different perspective on the issue. He argues that contrary to popular views, men tended to have a 'much kinder take' on female body fat, eating and sex appeal than many women. And instead of regarding men as 'the cause of the problem', they should be allowed to counteract the view that 'female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males'. Male pupils should be encouraged to tell their female counterparts that curves (which Kim Kardashian is famous for) and body fat are attractive, a child health expert has said . Dr Sigman, a specialist who advises schools, will address a closed gathering of PSHE teachers as part of a HMC Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference professional development programme. He will tell them that men are crucial to addressing the problem in schools. He will say: 'Addressing this problem must extend beyond the 'learn to love your body' and 'media literacy' lessons in the classroom to include more input from the men in a girl's life. 'Men are an untapped army who need to become aggressively vocal about the culture and messages bearing down on their daughters, partners, sisters and female friends. 'Men have a very different and much kinder take on female body fat, sex appeal, eating and weight loss. 'Knowing what men think can actually serve as an antidote to the prevailing assumptions that feed body dissatisfaction.' Last year, the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) found hospitals were dealing with a rising number of eating disorder cases, with the biggest rise among youngsters aged ten to 19. Dr Aric Sigman believes men are crucial in the fight against negative body image and should be used to counteract the view that ‘female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males’ Body image is already routinely tackled in schools as part of personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) classes. Dr Sigman argues men are sometimes slow to become involved in this delicate subject because they were traditionally seen as the cause of the problem. He will say: 'Today men are in a position to countercheck the prevailing highly damaging generalisation that female body fat is unattractive and disliked by males. 'This is not replacing one prescriptive view of the ideal female form with another. 'Whether we consider it politically incorrect or not, how men - meaning in this case fathers, brothers, grandfathers and partners - see women's bodies is a real part of life.' Dr Sigman, the author of The Body Wars1, has compiled researching suggesting men do not find body fat or the 'pear shape' aversive. According to him, fathers can play an especially important role in preventing and helping their daughters to overcome body image pressures. He will say: 'Men are often surprised to discover how even the most intelligent, capable, rational and empowered women can be laid low by body dissatisfaction. Many of us just don't get it. 'When made aware, men can be protective and aggressive if they believe their daughters or partners are being made unhappy in this way. It's time we harness this different perspective and ensure it's put to good use.' Dr Sigman, a chartered biologist and chartered psychologist, worked on health education campaigns with the Department of Health. Last year, he argued that even television news was damaging to young girls because the news readers were 'on a permanent diet'.","Dr Aric Sigman believes men are crucial in halting rise in eating disorders .

A would-be Liberal Democrat MP has been suspended by the party and withdrawn his candidacy after being questioned by police over historic child sex allegations. Jason Zadrozny, who was due to stand as an MP in the marginal Ashfield seat, was questioned by officers yesterday over allegations relating to the abuse of a 16-year-old boy. Today Mr Zadrozny issued a statement saying he 'vehemently' denies the allegations and was withdrawing from the general election while he fights to clear his name. He said: 'I am today withdrawing my candidacy as a prospective parliamentary candidate for the Ashfield and Eastwood Constituency. 'Yesterday I was questioned by Nottinghamshire Police about historic allegations, some of which are over ten years old. 'I am in full cooperation with the police and vehemently refute the allegations. 'I have spent the last ten years championing the cause of the Liberal Democrats both locally and nationally and I do not want this allegation to detract from the real issues facing local residents in the upcoming elections. 'Therefore I will step down with immediate effect as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate to spend my time clearing my name.' Nottinghamshire police said: 'A man has been bailed following an investigation in historic sexual offences. 'The 34-year-old was arrested yesterday and questioned about an allegation of gross indecency with a male under 16 between September 2003 and April 2004, sexual activity with a child between May 2004 and December 2007 and an allegation of meeting a child under 16 following sexual grooming from May 2004 and December 2007.' Officers said all the offences had been committed against one victim. Mr Zadrozny has been bailed until June. Mr Zadrozny is an experienced Lib Dem campaigner and came within a narrow margin of winning the Ashfield seat at the last general election. Mr Zadrozny (pictured with party leader Nick Clegg) has 'vehemently' denied the allegations, and said he has withdrawn his nomination as MP while he fights to clear his name . According to news reports from the time, Mr Zadrozny secured a swing of 17 per cent from Labour, but was ultimately defeated by a margin of just 192 votes. He lost to TV journalist Gloria De Piero, who had taken over the seat from disgraced former MP Geoff Hoon, who was caught up in the expenses scandal of 2009. Mr Zadrozny, who serves as an Ashfield District and Nottinghamshire County Councillor for Sutton North, was selected to fight the seat back in September 2013. At the time, Simon Hughes, deputy of the Liberal Democrats, said there was 'nobody better' to fight for the Ashfield seat. This evening Mr Zadrozny's Twitter feed had been deactivated, and his profile page on the Lib Dem's website deactivated. A Lib Dem spokesman said: 'We have been made aware of a police investigation in Ashfield. The party has immediately suspended the party's parliamentary candidate pending the outcome of a police investigation. 'We are unable to make any further comment at this stage.' Mr Zadrozny's suspension is just the latest blow to hit political parties in the rundown to May's hotly-contested general election. Mr Zadronzy's suspension is just the latest blow for the major parties heading into this May's general election. Tory MP Aidan Burley, who represented Cannock Chase, stood down today after a series of scandals . Ukip MEP and parliamentary hopeful Janice Atkinson was expelled from Ukip earlier this week after claims her assistant was filmed trying to cheat expenses . Earlier this week Ukip expelled one of its most prominent MEPs, and general election candidate for Folkestone and Hythe, after she was allegedly caught fiddling expenses. Janice Atkinson and her assistant Christine Hewitt were kicked out of the party after Ms Hewitt was reportedly filmed trying to claim £3,150 for a drinks party that actually cost £950. Just a day later Tim Wilson, who was due to stand for MP in South Northamptonshire, quit the party, saying leader Nigel Farage had failed to condemn another of his MEPs who compared a Muslim politician to terrorist Abu Hamza. Earlier today a Tory MP mired in scandal also quit parliament after just five years, departing with a whinging speech about not being paid enough, and a swipe at 'rude' constituents. Aidan Burley, who represented Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was once caught being the best man at a Nazi-themed stag do, and also described the Olympic opening ceremony as 'leftie multicultural crap'.

I had only two subjects remaining before I graduated from university with a degree in English literature. Since I was 10 years old, I have loved English and dreamed of becoming a teacher. I want to teach the younger ones, especially now, because children are the ones who will rebuild our country. They are Syria's future, and they deserve our significant investment. Three years ago, my family was forced to flee our home near Damascus, in east Ghouta. Thankfully, we got out before chemical warfare was used there. We stayed in Syria for the next year, moving from one house to another, from one village to another. With each move, we felt no comfort, no safety. When you feel unsafe in a place that is being bombed nearly every day, you eventually must make a choice: Ours was to leave. And with only two packed bags, we did. We went to Jordan. I've thought of returning to Syria. I want to be part of my country's rebuilding, but sadly, I don't expect this to happen any time soon. When we arrived in Jordan, I thought I would return soon to Syria -- in only a few weeks. We all thought so. It's been two years. And while I still hope to go home one day, my biggest question is: ""When?"" I want to return so that I can teach. As a child, I was inspired by my third-grade teacher, who believed children are the future and who challenged us at that young age to create a better world. I think it's rare for a teacher to instill this so passionately in her students, but I want to try. Although I hope to follow in my teacher's footsteps, my path for now is blocked by the uncertainty of living far from home, by a war that has driven me here, by tuition costs in Jordan that are prohibitively expensive. Being away from home presents many challenges. You feel like a stranger in a foreign place. You're not among people who know you, or who want to know you.  As a Syrian refugee, it is nearly impossible to get permission to be officially employed, and I've no money to complete my studies. Overnight, my dreams changed. In one moment I was at home with family and friends dreaming of studying English, of becoming a schoolteacher.  In the next, it all feels lost. It's impossible to work, impossible to study. We hope to meet our needs today, not so much to fulfill our dreams tomorrow. In Syria, I was responsible to my parents, now I am responsible for them. I dreamed of being a teacher, but because my parents are old, I must try each week just to protect them, to cover their basic needs of shelter, food and medicine. I needed some way to support my family. While most Syrians are not permitted to work, we can volunteer. I found a role with the poverty-fighting organization CARE in the urban refugee center in East Amman, Jordan, where I earn a stipend doing meaningful volunteer work. I have enjoyed it so much. After working there, I have become more social, and no longer feel isolated. It's not like sitting at home, feeling powerless, losing confidence, wondering what I can do to help my family, to help my people. Instead, I feel empowered. I recognize my potential. And, because of that, I refuse to give up on my dreams. My hope is to resettle for the short term in another country so I can continue my studies. I want to complete my education -- and reclaim my dream of teaching Syrian children. Resettling could help shape my future so that I can help shape theirs. One day, I will tell them of the crisis we faced in the Syria that I left. We must be aware of this history, and learn from it. We must empower children to speak up and then be sure that their voices are heard. Change starts with them. And it starts with us. Each person has the right to pursue an education, to meet their most basic needs, to express themselves. When those rights are stifled, so, too, is a person's potential, her opportunities, her power to create a better world, and in my case, a better Syria. My question to the U.S. people and the international community is this: Imagine your life has been turned upside down after you lose everything in a matter of hours: What do you believe in then? What do you cling to? The answer, I think, is: your dreams. We all have them.

Do not include any assumptions, opinions, generalizations, interpretations, or extraneous context.",9,"(CNN)Reading the headlines out of Madison, Wisconsin, it's hard not to think about Ferguson, Missouri. But law enforcement's response to the shooting of 19-year-old Tony Robinson will not unfold in the same chaotic, violent and distrusting way as the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown, Madison's top police leaders vowed. ""I think it's very clear that Madison, Wisconsin, is not Ferguson, Missouri,"" said Jim Palmer, the executive director of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association. The head of the state's largest law enforcement group told CNN Monday that the Madison police department, unlike the Ferguson department, has a strong relationship with the people it serves. Madison Police Chief Mike Koval has been out front and outspoken about Robinson's shooting since it happened late Friday night. The chief said he understands people are angry and want answers. ""We have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold,"" he said. Here are some ways Madison law enforcement appears to be responding differently than what was seen in Ferguson: . Difference in what police chiefs did after shooting . Madison: Within hours of the shooting, Koval went to Robinson's mother's home. ""We need to start as any healing or any reconciliation should with an 'I'm sorry,' and I've done that privately, and I'm attempting to do that publicly and that's the only way we can sort of begin the healing or the rift that may take years if at all to mend,"" the police chief said. The mother didn't want to meet with him but the chief talked and prayed with the biracial teenager's grandparents in the driveway, he said. They told Koval to hold off on trying to talk to the mother because emotions were too intense. ""I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,"" Koval said. ""Nineteen years old is too young."" He stressed that ""the effort has to be there,"" in reaching out to the family. ""We have to acknowledge it, we have to own it, we have to say we are sorry at the outset for it and then we have to show affirmative steps in moving forward to bring community back into the fold, as it were."" Ferguson: A day after Brown, who was African-American, was killed, protesters took to the streets of the Missouri town. They were incensed that witnesses said Brown's hands were up and that the teen's body had remained in the street, in the sun, for four hours. A month went by before Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson apologized to Brown's family. ""I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,"" he said, in a videotaped message. A day after Brown's killing a vigil for him devolved into violence. Police tried to keep the crowd under control but clashes erupted. One officer was seen holding the leash of a barking dog, and St. Louis Alderman Antonio French said some officers wielded shotguns. Four days after Brown was killed and more than a day after riots erupted in Ferguson, Jackson spoke at a community forum, saying, the situation ""has been a tragedy for the city and the country."" Responding to criticism that he'd missed immediate opportunities to address tension in the town that turned into violence, he said, ""It breaks my heart [that] some think I'm part of the problem."" The police chief promised the crowd he would be part of the solution. But issues with how the department interacted with protesters and media continued. ""Keep moving"" was a common refrain that police told protesters and law enforcement threatened to arrest anyone who stood along sidewalks, whether they were resting or a reporter taking notes. In some cases, officers told demonstrators they couldn't stand for more than five seconds; some protesters were yelled at for walking too slowly. Such a tactic was a violation of the Constitution, a federal judge later ruled. In his videotaped message, Jackson apologized for that, too. ""The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry,"" the police chief said. Five ways the Ferguson police chief is in hot water . Difference in investigation procedures: . Madison: Under Wisconsin law, an outside agency is tasked with investigating police-involved shootings. In the case in Madison, that would be the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes its work, findings will be delivered to the local district attorney, Chief Koval said. On Monday, Gov. Scott Walker issued a statement saying that another layer of investigation will come from the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which will conduct an independent investigation -- a requirement of all officer-involved deaths. Ferguson: Chief Jackson asked the St. Louis County Police Department to conduct an independent investigation into Brown's killing. It was only a few days that passed between the shooting and when Jon Belmar, the chief of St. Louis County Police Department, told media what led to Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shooting Brown. ""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Belmar said. Brown ""physically assaulted"" the officer, Belmar said, and the teen tried to get the officer's weapon. Differences with timing of releasing the officer's name . Madison: Chief Koval released the name of the officer who shot Robinson within hours of the incident. He is 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny. The chief volunteered that the officer had shot and killed a man in 2007. Kenny was cleared on any wrongdoing in that incident, the chief said, because an investigation determined that the man was killed in a ""suicide by cop"" situation. During the incident involving Robinson, Kenny suffered a blow to the head, Koval said. He has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation. Ferguson: Three days after Brown was killed, Ferguson police backtracked on a promise made a day earlier to release the name of the officer. The reason the department gave? Threats made to another officer who was falsely accused on social media of shooting Brown, Jackson said. The chief said he thought the threats were ""credible"" and that ""the safety factor far outweighs the benefit from releasing the name, which is minimal."" Lawyers representing Brown's family blasted the decision, and accused the police of protecting their own and ignoring standard procedures. Difference in how authorities described victim's past . Madison: Wisconsin Circuit Court documents indicate Robinson pleaded guilty in December to an armed robbery that occurred last April. But when Koval was pressed for more details, he refused to talk about the teen's record or any run-ins with law enforcement. ""I could but I choose not to,"" the chief said. ""I frankly think it is, for our purposes today, wholly inappropriate and I am not going to blemish anyone's character, particularly someone's as young as his."" Ferguson: Six days after Brown's shooting -- on the same day police released Officer Wilson's name -- police released surveillance video of a convenience store robbery in which Brown was allegedly involved before he died. The decision to release that video frustrated many, including others in law enforcement. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson stated the robbery and shooting of Brown ""are separate issues."" ""I told (Chief Jackson) I think both of those being released today was not needed and was not the way that we needed to go,"" Johnson told CNN. ""Today is about taking care of this incident here, getting to those facts that are there, and Michael Brown and his family."" Differences in mayor's reaction immediately after shooting . Madison: Less than a day after the shooting, Mayor Paul Soglin vowed that ""there will be answers,"" the Wisconsin State Journal reported.  ""We all deserve to know the facts in this case,"" he said. ""Tony Robinson's family deserves that, our community deserves that, and the Madison Police deserve that. When the answers come, we will be open and transparent in communicating them."" The promise to be transparent in sharing results of an investigation were repeated on the city's web site. Ferguson: Ferguson Mayor James Knowles urged the community to stay calm and not escalate the situation. ""We don't know what happened and there are lots of conflicting stories,"" Knowles said. ""Unfortunately there will have to be some time taken to understand what happened. Hopefully we will get to an understanding and justice will be served."" Speaking a day after a vigil for Brown devolved into a riot, Knowles said on CNN that ""the events of last night are not indicative of who we are,"" and that the chaos was ""not constructive"" and only ""bringing down the community.""

But the 34-year-old’s decision to hit the bleach bottle again is one I can understand. Kanye West says he prefers the reality star’s lighter locks and who can blame him, from Marilyn Monroe to Brigitte Bardot, we’re a society obsessed with iconic blonde bombshells. Hailed as the beauty idol of the 2010s, it’s no wonder Kim Kardashian decided to re-join the ranks of famous blonde stars. Scroll down for video . Rosy said changing her hair colour has made her feel as though she stands out from the crowd . Rosy, pictured left before dyeing her hair, says Kim Kardashian's new look 'takes a lot of guts' While her fashion sense is often questionable, there’s no denying Kim’s influence in the beauty stakes - she’s the woman that turned the world on to contouring, after all. A study last year by hair-care brand Schwarzkopf showed that blondes make up 30 per cent of the retail hair dye market and contribute to 60 per cent of salon business - those numbers are surely set to rise with Kim’s look sparking a wave of women going over to the lighter side. Hairdressers may say a drastic hair change like Kim’s is a sign of something dramatic going on in a person’s life, but that wasn’t the case for me when I decided to take the plunge from brunette to blonde last November. While I’ve been known to reach for reach for the hair dye immediately after a break up, going blonde wasn’t a spur of the moment decision but more a reflection of my realisation that life’s too short not to have fun. And do blondes have more fun? In my experience, definitely. Extreme new look: Rosy had her hair dyed at the Bleach London salon in Dalston by hairstylist Naoya . Rosy, pictured before, left, and after, right, said was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak . Rosy said she now gets lots more attention from men after going platinum . My hair was bleached at the Bleach London salon in Dalston by hairstylist Naoya. The whole process, including blow dry, took three and a half hours in total. As I had previously coloured my hair, it was treated as a colour correction rather than a virgin bleach. Naoya first applied a pre-lightener mixed with peroxide to the ends of my hair to lift the colour out, then after applied the mixture to my roots (as they process faster) to ensure it was all an even colour. The bleach was then washed off and a golden toner was applied to banish any brassy tones. I now get my roots done every 6-8 weeks to maintain the look. As a brunette I often felt mousey, invisible and way older than my 25 years. Sometimes I could even feel myself slowly blending into the background in social situations and no change of outfit or make-up seemed to make a difference. When my hairdresser Naoya at Bleach London suggested I’d suit a light blonde tone, I first balked at the idea, worried it would ruin the condition. Platinum seemed like a big step from the subtle tints, golden tones and buttery highlights I was used to. But when a friend of a friend dyed her natural brown locks a stunning bright blonde and I saw how happy she looked, I knew it was just what I needed. An extreme colour change takes a lot of guts and I applaud women like Kim for taking risks and not sticking to the same look. I don’t agree that she’s lost her signature style, if anything she stands out from the crowd even more. The first thing I noticed when I left the hairdressers was the amount of people suddenly staring at me, it was as if someone had finally lifted my invisibility cloak. Rosy says the most noticeable difference after her new look was how she was treated by men . Rosy said she went from 'mousey' (left) to being served first at a bar after going blonde (right) Kim Kardashian unveiled her new look with husband Kanye West at Paris Fashion Week yesterday . If you fancy having light locks, get ready for a lot of stares from strangers - bright hair is more uncommon so people tend to unconsciously let their gaze linger. My friends and family loved my new look but all agreed I looked like a completely different person - a sentiment shared by my colleagues at work who didn’t even recognise me when I walked into the office the next day. The most noticeable difference of all was the way men treated me. They say that gentlemen prefer blondes, and whether that’s true or not, they most certainly prefer me as one. While I would never base my self-worth on how appealing I am to the opposite sex, I must admit I now find it flattering to get served first at a bar or walk into a room to a flurry of turning heads. Rosy said she met her current partner - and found herself inundated with offers - after changing her hair colour . Rosy said there are downsides to being a blonde, left, but says she would never go back to being brunette . 1. Avoid daily shampooing to help hair retain moisture. 2. Get a trim every 8 weeks to refresh the cuticle. 3. Sleep on a silk pillowcase to reduce friction. 4. Keep heat styling for special occasions only. 5. Brush hair using a Tangle Teezer or Mason Pearson brush. After being single for six months, I also suddenly found myself inundated with offers and it’s no coincidence that the day after my blonde transformation I ended up meeting my current partner. But what I appreciate the most is how members of both sexes listen to me more in conversation. When I speak as a platinum blonde, people pay attention. Why? It’s more than my hair colour, it’s because I finally feel confident. It may be even more of a stereotype than the out-dated ‘dumb blonde’ jokes, but confidence really is the most attractive quality to possess. I didn’t just look like a different person, I felt like one. It was as if overnight I had become more outgoing, sociable and self-assured. Of course, there are downsides. Like the memes of Kim Kardashian circulating the internet, people have stopped me to ask if I’m wearing Daenerys’ wig from Game of Thrones or tell me I remind them of Legolas. Overall, it’s a small price to pay for feeling this great. I’ve gone blonde and I’m not going back.","Rosy Cherrington, 25, says changing hair colour made her more confident .

Jasem Emwazi, 51, feels there is 'no proof' that the black-clad knife-wielding man featured in chilling hostage execution videos is his eldest child, it was reported today. His Kuwaiti lawyer, Salem Al-Hashah, told Kuwait's respected Al-Qabas newspaper: 'He is not sure that he [Jihadi John] is his son. 'There is no proof that the man shown in the videos and photographs is his son, as the media has reported in the last few days.' Scroll down for video . 'No proof': Jasem Emwazi, 51,  said that he was not convinced the Islamic State executioner was his eldest child Mohammed, according to his lawyer . Mr Emwazi (left) was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police about his son's activities . He added: 'There is no evidence that Mohammed is the man in the videos because his face was covered.' The lawyer's comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi, who is said to have told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist' and called for him to be killed. Mr Emwazi, who moved to the UK from his native Kuwait in 1994 and holds a British passport, was seen in public for the first time today since he was questioned by Kuwaiti police at the weekend about his son's activities. A Kuwaiti journalist present at a meeting in his lawyer's office in the upmarket Salmiya district of Kuwait said Mr Emwazi looked 'very scared' and was shaking. Mr Al-Hashah said the father is not responsible for what his son has done and that there is nothing to prove his father agreed with his son, or helped him in any way. The lawyer added: 'Jasem Emwazi is under stress. Many people are calling him names. He can't leave his home and can't walk outside. He is scared of people because everyone believes all the rumours that have been written about him.' The comments appear to contradict earlier remarks made by Mr Emwazi (left) who allegedly told a colleague that his son is 'a dog, an animal, a terrorist'. Pictured right: Mohammed Emwazi in a 1996 school photograph . Mr Al-Hashah said Kuwaiti police called Mr Emwazi at the weekend and he was interviewed by officers for two to three hours before being allowed to go without any restrictions. The lawyer said no foreign intelligence services have tried to contact Mr Emwazi since his 26-year-old son was identified as Jihadi John last week. Mr Al-Hashah said Mr Emwazi and his eldest daughter Asma, 25, are currently in Kuwait. His wife Ghaneya, 47, and other children are in Britain. He said Asma, who studied architecture at university in London, has denied reports that there are other extremists in her family. The two faces of Jihadi John: Mohammed Emwazi is seen before he went to Syria (left) and in one of the horrific execution videos made by ISIS (right) The lawyer for Mr Emwazi, a former London taxi driver, said the family was under great stress and that they were not responsible for Jihadi John's actions . The lawyer insisted that Mr Emwazi does not have a job in Kuwait - although MailOnline yesterday spoke to three colleagues who said he is employed as the manager of a co-operative farm supplies depot near the Iraqi border. Mr Al-Hashah said he is in Kuwait temporarily to visit his mother and his daughter and had been in the country since November 30. Mr Emwazi now intends to sue media outlets and social media users who have damaged his family's reputation, his lawyer said. 'I have a message to the Kuwaiti people that many of the rumours are false,' he told the daily. Media and experts identified Emwazi as the ISIS militant believed to be responsible for beheading at least five Westerners. A recent film is believed to show Emwazi shortly after he arrived in Syria in 2013 (pictured) 'Because I felt that some people have believed it, I have assigned a lawyer to defend me and to prove ... that what is being said is untrue,' he said. It was not clear why he appeared to be retracting statements reported earlier that he and his wife had recognised their son's voice. His lawyer Salem al-Hashash said he would from Sunday file lawsuits against those who made accusations against Emwazi senior and his family. Hashash said his client was interrogated by the interior ministry for three hours and released. The Emwazi family were living in a house in north London (pictured) but Mr Emwazi is now in native Kuwait . A lawyer had been appointed in Britain to defend family members there, Hashash said. Mohammed Emwazi, the alleged executioner, was born in Kuwait to a stateless family of Iraqi origin. His parents moved to Britain in 1993 after their hopes of obtaining Kuwaiti citizenship were quashed. Emwazi visited Kuwait several times, the last time between January 18 and April 26, 2010, Al-Qabas said. A year later, he was denied entry to Kuwait after his name came up during investigations into attacks in Britain. Media and experts have identified Emwazi as the Islamic State group militant believed to be responsible for beheading at least five Westerners.","Jasem Emwazi not convinced balaclava-clad butcher is son Mohammed .

Now Google has been granted a patent that hints that the clunky piece of hardware could one day be replaced with not much at all. It suggests that using audio sensors that plug into a smartphone or tablet, any flat surface could be transformed into a virtual keyboard. Just like magic: Google has been granted a patent (image shown) that suggests that using audio sensors that plug into a smartphone or tablet, any flat surface could be transformed into a virtual keyboard . The design would make it far easier to type on devices with smaller touchscreens, which are currently dominated by pop-up keyboards. The patent suggests that a user would tap on a surface just as if they were typing on a regular keyboard. The audio sensors would decipher vibrations made by tapping to work out which ‘keys’ a user is pressing and the corresponding letters would appear on a screen, like normal, Quartz reported. The patent hints that the Google is one of many thinking about ways to revolutionise large piece of hardware, which have outgrown portable devices such as tablets and phones. A Samsung patent (pictured) shows a system that could turn a user’s hand into a keyboard . Developers have created a keyboard cover that turns every key of the board into one emoji. Once installed, the Caps Lock key lets users switch between regular and emoji keys meaning people can easily add images to Facebook posts, tweets and even official documents. Developers have made a keyboard cover that turns every key  into one emoji (shown) The Emoji Keyboard and its custom software were developed by a team of designers at California-based Disk Cactus. Each of the covers are made of silicone and act like standard covers to block out dust, dirt and liquid. More than 150 emoji are accessible directly from the keyboard but using the Shift, Control, and Option keys gives access to related characters. It is available to pre-order from Kickstarter for just $15 (£10) and, if funded, will ship in April. The design may have a few drawbacks however, as it could make typing tricky for people who can’t touch type and no cushioning when pressing ‘keys’ would mean that the process could become uncomfortable or even painful after a while. While the patent filing doesn’t mean that Google is working on the design, it hints that the firm is one of many thinking about ways to revolutionise the traditionally large piece of hardware, which has outgrown many portable devices such as tablets and phones. A patent filed by Samsung last March showed a wearable system that could turn a user’s hand into a keyboard. In the proposed system, people wearing a camera - on a Google Glass-style device dubbed Galaxy Glass - would be able to look down at their hands, which would be mapped using a virtual keyboard, and use their thumbs to select the keys, negating the need for a physical keyboard. The patent reads: ‘Recently there is much interest in the wearable computers such as glasses-type terminal and wristwatch terminals. ‘Such wearable computers are even more limited in space for mounting an input means such as button type keypad and touchscreen.' The system involves a camera for capturing an image, a storage unit that stores the ‘key to hand mapping table,’ a display and a control unit. Numbers could be assigned to a forefinger, for example, while symbols could be assigned to the middle finger. Alternatively, letters could be plotted at various points across the fingers and palm from top to bottom. Users would then use their thumb to ‘press’ the various keys on both hands. The camera would capture the movement of the thumb, or identify the force pressed onto each finger, to establish which key had been pressed and type the message accordingly.","Patent suggests audio sensors could be plugged into a phone or tablet .

'Again, we do apologize,' the pilot said over the intercom to the 57 disappointed passengers. Casey Boyd, from Denver, was flying to Mexico on vacation with his wife and child when their plans were unexpectedly derailed by an unspecified clerical error. ‘No, it sounds pretty unbelievable,’ Boyd said. ‘It doesn't sound like maybe the whole story.’ A spokeswoman for SkyWest Airlines stated that Flight 4507 landed in Salt Lake City at around 6pm to correct a 'paperwork issue.’ Pit stop: Instead of landing at Licenciado Gustavo Díaz Ordaz International Airport in Puerto Vallarta, the SkyWest jet headed to Arizona to be refueled .

Burnley face Tottenham at home on Sunday and Dyche must try to find a way of stopping Kane whose career has rocketed since honing his skills out on loan at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester earlier in his career. Dyche was also in the queue to sign Kane after taking over as Burnley manager in 2012, and he believes that the 21-year-old striker's spells in the Championship have helped make him the player he is today. Harry Kane at the Juventus Arena in Turin ahead of his firsts start for England . 'He's a player that most people would have had a look at when he wasn't in the side at Tottenham,' said Dyche. 'It's a good reflection of how the loan system can work, and it doesn't have to be the glory loan – the one where it works every time. He's had his ups and downs on loan but that can be a massive part of a young player's development, experiencing the fact that it doesn't always work hand in glove. 'It's not always perfect, you don't play every week, you have to challenge yourself to keep going and keep grinding and be professional every day to be ready to play when you're called upon. 'He was out at Millwall and it was possibly a step too early when he went out to Norwich to play there, and then Leicester a few bits and bobs off the bench. Kane enjoyed a phenomenal start to his international career by scoring on his debut last Friday . Kane headed home against Lithuania just 79 seconds after coming on to the field as a substitute . 'All of that for a young man who seems to me to have a very good temperament and a very good desire to be a footballer, (shows that) if you stick at it long enough you get your rewards. It has to be the ups and downs of football to bring the reality.' FA chairman Greg Dyke tabled a series of new proposals last week aimed at increasing the number of homegrown players in the Premier League. Burnley are the only team in the top-flight to field an all-British team this season, and Dyche believes that the only way for players like Kane to truly progress is to be given a chance at the highest level. Kane was sent on loan to several clubs in the lower leagues, including here at Millwall, before he found fame . The 21-year-old striker has taken the Premier League by storm this season with his glut of goals . 'It's not an exact science,' he added. 'The way the FA are trying to take a grip of it is to try and crunch it down to a better chance of elite young players coming through the system, and an improved chance of them being future England players. 'I don't think there's a perfect situation but they are certainly searching hard to find the best situation of allowing those players real growth.

Canada's annual 'commercial seal hunt', which mainly takes place during March and April, sees thousands of young seals clubbed to death for their furs. The annual quota for the seal hunt has gone up in recent years, despite the market for seal pelts collapsing following an near world-wide ban on the furs. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: A number of harp seals lay on the ice next to the skinned carcasses of other animals surrounded by pools of blood in the wake of a day during the annual Canadian seal hunt . A seal hunter gets ready to kill a harp seal with a blow to the head with the 'hammer' end of a hakapik . Killing fields: An aerial view of a seal hunting camp shows over a thousand harp seal pelts covering the ground at the end of a day of hunting . Last month, Canada's Fisheries Minister Gail Shea set the seal hunt quota to 400,000 harp seals, 60,000 grey seals and 8,200 hooded seals  - a total of more than 468,000 animals. The seals are mainly killed for their pelts, but hunters also sell their blubber, which is used to make ‘seal oil’ and sold as a health supplement, and the penises, which are a popular ingredient in aphrodisiacs in some Asian markets. In order to avoid damage to the pelts, a majority of the seals are killed with clubs or a ‘hakapik’ – a seal hunting tool which has a hammer head used to crush a seal's skull, and a hook used to drag away the carcass. Although hunters and the Canadian government claims these methods are humane,  animal rights advocates say an alarming number of the seals are skinned while alive and responsive to pain. The Humane Society of the United States claims that independent, international team of veterinarians observed the hunt and examined the corpses of skinned seals. They found evidence that up to 40 per cent of the dead seals had skull injuries that were not sufficient to have caused death. Looking for seal: Bertrand Oucoin from Magdalen Islands aboard the Emy Serge D for the annual seal hunt . Death in numbers: The 2015 seal hunt quota to 400,000 harp seals, 60,000 grey seals and 8,200 hooded seals - a total of more than 468,000 animals . 'Humane': A majority of seals are killed with clubs or a ‘hakapik’ to the head in order to avoid damaging the pelt . Killing: The annual quota of seals has gone up since the Nougties, despite the actual number of seals killed going down in the wake of several countries  banning import of products from commercial seal hunting . Threats: Animal rights activists are also criticising the high quotas on the base that global warming is threatening all seal species in Canada as the ice, where the seals breed, is melting . Seal hunters are not allowed to kill seal pups which have yet to molt their downy white coat, however, this usually happens when the pup is between just ten to 21 days. Adult seals are harder to hunt, and mainly has to be shot rather than clubbed – a tough task when the animal is in the water which also risks destroying the pelt. As a result, an estimated 95-98 per cent of the seals killed during the commercial hunt are three weeks to three months old. The seal hunt quota set by the Canadian government has rolled over from last season and the 400,000 harp seal allowance has remained steady since 2011, up from in 2010 and 280,000 in 2009. However, despite the large hunting quotas, approximately 94,000 harp seals were killed during the commercial hunt in 2013. This  was an increase from 71,000 in 2012 and just 38,000 in 2011. The recent number of seals killed is a significant drop in numbers from the mid-to-late noughties with 218,000 harp seals killed in 2008, 355,000 in 2006 and a jaw-dropping 366,000 in 2004. The reason for the drop in number of animals killed is a near world-wide ban of sales of the seals' fur, which has seen the global market collapse. The United States, the EU, Taiwan, Switzerland, Mexico and the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Armenia have all stopped their trade in some or all products of commercial seal hunts. ‘The quotas are going up every year, despite opposition and the market for seal pelts disappearing,’ says Andy Ottaway of the Seal Protection Action Group. ‘The recent EU ban on import of seal products has led to a dramatic collapse in the market. ‘The government is keeping the quotas they have already set, but the actual hunters themselves cannot be bothered to go out because they cannot sell the pelts. The incentive is gone. ‘If the EU ban had happened a decade ago perhaps the hunt would've grinded to a halt by now.’ Clubbing babies: An estimated 95-98 per cent of the seals killed during the commercial hunt are three weeks to three months old .

No change: Despite the hunting quotas for harp seals staying at 400,000, just 94,000 harp seals were killed during the commercial hunt in 2013 . Blood on their hands: Bertrand Oucoin  pulls a harp seal onto his barge at the beginning of the annual seal hunting season . The recent number of seals killed during the Canadian cull is a significant drop in numbers from the mid- to late noughties with 218,000 harp seals killed in 2008, 355,000 in 2006 and 366,000 in 2004 . There are also further threats to the Canadian seals, as climate change is causing their ice habitat to deteriorate at an alarming rate. In recent years, the Canadian government has estimated a near 100 per cent mortality for pups born in key whelping areas when the sea ice melted too soon in the season, and the pups drowned. ‘And as global warming is thinning the ice, which is the seal’s breeding area, the species is already under threat,' Mr Ottaway adds. 'It’s outrageous that the Canadian government is putting quotas up on an endangered species.' However, seal hunters and Canada's Fisheries Department (DFO) says the hunt is sustainable and humane, and earns money for isolated fishing communities in Atlantic Canada. Seal hunting methods have been studied and approved by the Royal Commission on Seals and Sealing who concluded 'the methods of hunting seals compare favorably to those used to hunt any other wild or domestic animal'. Why: The seals are mainly killed for their pelts, but hunters also sell their blubber and the penises, which are a popular ingredient in aphrodisiacs in Asia . Blow: Despite hunters claiming it is a humane killing method, animal rights activists claim many seals are skinned while alive and responsive to pain . Red seas: Pelts from harp seals lie in pools of blood after a long day of seal hunting in Canada . In a statement to MailOnline, a DFO spokesperson defended the high quotas saying 'decisions are informed by science.' 'The overall Atlantic seal population, including harp seals, grey seals and hooded seals is healthy and abundant. Harp seals are currently estimated at approximately 7.4 million animals which is more than three times what it was in the 1970s. 'It is truly unfortunate that decades of misinformation campaigns by animal rights groups have had such a negative effect on the economic well-being of rural and Aboriginal Canadians. 'The effects of these campaigns are not just being felt economically, but ecologically as well. For example, the Atlantic grey seal population eats more than 1 million tonnes of fish each year. This is having a drastic effect on many fish species, most notably cod. 'The Government of Canada has been rock solid in its support for Canadian sealers. We will continue to stand up for trade fairness for this important, traditional way of life.' Rebecca Aldworth, executive director of Humane Society International Canada, condemns the quota as irresponsible. 'Canada's Fisheries Minister has yet again ignored sound science in favour of her political agenda,' Ms Aldworth said in a statement. 'The Canadian government acknowledges that climate change is causing mass mortalities for these ice-dependent seals, yet is still endorsing the largest mass slaughter of marine mammals on the planet. 'Instead of setting irresponsible and unsustainable seal quotas, our government should take immediate steps to end the commercial seal slaughter through a federal sealing industry buyout.'","Canadian seal hunt is the largest marine mammal cull on the planet .

A neighbour launched a revolting hate campaign against a 'tormented' family by defecating on their doorstep four times in the dead of the night. Damian Ayles carried out the twisted act before posting used tissues through the family's letterbox. The 23-year-old was only caught when his unnamed victims set up security cameras outside their home to catch the culprit. It came after Ayles, from Twydall, Kent,  smeared excrement across the family's car as part of the unexplained vendetta. The court heard how Ayles was too embarrassed to watch the footage of himself after being arrested by police. As the images were shown at Medways Magistrates' Court, Ayles also looked down at the floor with his hand over his mouth. His mother, who was sat in the public gallery, also looked away. Magistrates were told that Ayles first defecated outside the family's home in April last year, but that the victims did not go to the police. But the court heard how the same incident occurred again twice in September, prompting them to set up a security camera. The CCTV finally caught Ayles carrying out the act again in the middle of the night on September 29. Police then tracked Ayles down after finding traces of his DNA in the faeces, the court was told. Prosecutor Debbie Jones said: 'The defendant can be seen at 3.30am on September 29 pulling down his trousers, moving to the squat position and having a poo. 'He then wipes himself and puts it (the dirty tissue) in the letterbox and smears some of the faeces on their vehicle.' Ayles pleaded guilty to harassment without violence and was given a two-year restraining order preventing him from going near the family. He was also given a 12-month community order and told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work. Ayles was also ordered to pay the family £350 in compensation and £85 in court costs. After the case a spokesman for the family said: 'I hope that the community service is cleaning up dog poo from children's playing parks.' Ayles, 23, pleaded guilty to harassment without violence and was given a two-year restraining order preventing him from going near the family . The court was told how the family, who have children, suffered stress and anxiety from the harassment and were left feeling unsafe in their home. They also told police they had been unable to sleep after being 'tormented' by Ayles's prolonged campaign. Chair of the bench Mandy Samrai said: 'This was a very serious matter.' Wayne Crowhurst, defending, said Ayles had autism and had the mental age of a 13 year-old. He said: 'He should not have done what he done and this is the end of the matter now, he wants to move on.'","Damian Ayles posted used tissues through family's postbox after the act .

These pictures show a teenage girl enjoying life in modern Britain before joining ISIS to become a ‘jihadi bride’. She laughs in the park, shows off vividly painted nails, and poses with the athletics’ squad of her East London school, where she was top of her science class. On Facebook, she writes of going swimming with a friend, loving the music of American rapper Tupac Shakur and enjoying a birthday treat. Few could have predicted what 15-year-old Amira Abase would do next. Two weeks ago, in the middle of half-term, she abruptly walked out of her family’s council home in East London, wearing black jeans and trainers. She caught a bus to Gatwick Airport and flew to Istanbul with two fellow Muslim classmates, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and Shamima Begum, 15. Next — in footage captured by CCTV cameras — the trio waited in the snow to board another bus to travel to the Turkish border with Syria. There, Islamic State militants were waiting for them. The girls, by now dressed in burkas, were bundled into cars and disappeared to a life where they will have to marry a fighter selected for them, never step foot outside without him, and become a household drone doing chores restricted to women. Intelligence services say they may even be trained to become fighters themselves. Amira is not the first Western girl to join Islamic State. Police said this week that 60 young British women, many of them schoolgirls, have left for Syria. Few, however, have been radicalised so swiftly as Amira Abase. Back in East London, her friends — many of them non-Muslims — have given a series of exclusive interviews to explain how she had changed before their eyes. As one 16-year-old girl told me this week: ‘She was perfectly normal. She talked about having a lip-piercing one day, and listened to pop chart songs. ‘She was pretty, popular, and a bit of a rebel who saw the funny side of life. I first met her in maths class four years ago. We became best friends.’ Painted nails: Fifteen-year-old Amira, who was born in Ethiopia, larks around with her friends in the park . Born in Ethiopia, Amira moved with her family first to England, and then Germany, before returning here and starting school at Bethnal Green Academy at the age of 11. ‘When I visited, I found her home was not overpoweringly Islamic,’ her friend added. ‘We had a family meal cooked by her mother, who did not wear the hijab at home. After eating, Amira and I went out to the park. ‘She had a BlackBerry phone at 11 or 12, and later an iPhone and computer. She was on them all the time.’ At school, Amira, a Chelsea football fan, shone in debates, once giving a speech on why Muslim women wear the veil. She passed three GCSEs in maths and science early, at age 14. This autumn, she’d planned to study A-level history, maths and biology at the London Academy of Excellence, set up for high-fliers under the free school programme. Her talents did not stop in class. At 13 and 14 she was a star of the school athletics squad, competing across Southern England in the 800 and 1,200 metres. Off to join ISIS: Amira (centre, circled) caught a bus to Gatwick Airport and flew to Istanbul with two fellow Muslim classmates, Kadiza Sultana (left), 16, and Shamima Begum (right), 15. They are pictured at Gatwick . Although she wore the hijab to class, covering her hair in line with Islamic teachings, she abandoned the headgear when she played sport or was with her girl friends. A member of the athletics squad explained: ‘Amira didn’t make a big thing about her Muslim faith. She came to parties if there was no alcohol, and we’d go shopping for clothes. She was one of us. ‘She got friendly with a boy she met at athletics. We teased her about standing very close to him, so she joked she was leaning on him for support. Her parents would not have approved of a boyfriend.’ Yet last year Amira was exposed to a parallel world from her non-Muslim friends. While they were going clubbing, meeting boyfriends, and taking foreign holidays together, these Western ways were forbidden to Amira because of her background. She was expected to pray regularly, and was, her friends think, facing an arranged marriage to a man of her family’s choice in the future. Another friend said: ‘We suspect she joined ISIS because it was exciting thing to do; a way of rebelling. Unlike us, there were not a lot of exciting options open to her.’ Model student: Amira was due to study three A-levels at the London Academy of Excellence this autumn . By the time of her 15th birthday in May last year, Amira had become a ‘different person’. She cut herself off from her ‘clique’ of non-Muslim friends, and mixed instead with two other Muslim girls in the same school year group: Kadiza and Shamima, who, of course, are now with her in Syria. Her old school friends said they were shocked when she sent them a video link claiming that Israelis were deliberately burning Palestinian children. ‘It was horrifying because it showed babies being hurt. I deleted it,’ admitted one. Amira and her two Muslim friends were overheard using derogatory terms for non-Muslim girls, calling one a ‘slag’ and others ‘kafir’ (an Arabic term for non-believer). ‘She was getting into religion and Middle Eastern affairs seriously. She hung around with these two Muslim girls all the time,’ said her friend. We now know that one of those girls, Shamima, used her Twitter account to contact a former medical student, 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, who left Glasgow last year to join ISIS and marry a jihadist. Bayrampasa bus station: In footage captured by CCTV cameras, the trio (above) waited  to board a bus to travel to the Turkish border with Syria. There, Islamic State militants were waiting for them . Shamima was following 70 other ISIS terrorists on Twitter, too, many of whom, like Aqsa, used a messaging programme called Surespot. This encrypts messages to avoid interception by intelligence authorities. When messages are deleted by ISIS recruiters, they are automatically erased from the phones of those who have received them. Friends suspect that Amira and the other girls were in touch with Aqsa and other ISIS recruiters via their mobile phones or home computers since before Christmas. ‘Amira is portrayed by police and the school as naïve and vulnerable,’ said one of her friends. ‘But she was savvy and intelligent, and used to getting what she wanted.’ Police were called to Bethnal Green Academy in December after a friend of Amira’s, a Muslim girl of 15 who has not been named, disappeared to Syria. They talked to Amira and her two new friends, but concluded they were not being groomed by ISIS online recruiters. Yet one of Amira’s friends insists: ‘By the time the police came, Amira had isolated herself from non-Muslim pupils. I am surprised the police did not discover she was already fascinated with the Islamic State and people like Jihadi John.’ Runner: At 13 and 14 Amira was a star of the school athletics squad, competing across Southern England in the 800 and 1,200 metres . Amira left her family home in the morning of Tuesday, February 17, telling her father she was going to a wedding. He believed her. She was carrying no luggage, although CCTV shows her and the other girls at Gatwick before boarding a flight with heavy holdalls. Who gave them the bags? Was it an on-the-ground ISIS recruiter in London? The question has not yet been answered. The bags contained the Islamic robes and coats with hoods that the girls were wearing by the time they reached Istanbul. By late morning on the Tuesday, Amira had texted her father, 47-year-old Abase Hussen, who thought his daughter was at the wedding. She said it was ‘a little bit far’, and added: ‘Daddy, I will pray my midday prayer and get back home.’ At midnight, the family reported Amira missing and were desperately messaging her school friends to see if she was with them. One of her old friends admits now: ‘I was getting worried about her. She told girls in school that she agreed with what the Islamic State was doing in Syria. ‘I feel that I have lost my friend for ever.’ She is probably right.","Amira Abase is one of three pupils from East London who went to Syria .

The 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was charged with arson after the flag was torn down from its pole and burned with a lighter weeks before Remembrance Sunday. The flag was then spat and urinated on during the incident in Borough Green, near Sevenoaks, Kent, in October 2014. 'Horrible': The 14-year-old admitted playing a part in the burning of this flag, alongside the son of jihadi bride Sally Jones, in the Kent village of Borough Green last October . The schoolboy appeared at youth court in Sevenoaks, Kent on Thursday, where he pleaded guilty to arson, supported by his mother and friend Jonathan Wilkinson . The 18-year-old - the son of jihadi bride Sally Jones - had already accepted a formal police caution for his part in the despicable act, along with another 14-year-old boy. The trio were caught on CCTV cameras climbing on each other's shoulders and tearing the Union Flag from its pole on October 27 - just weeks before Remembrance Sunday. The incident happened just months after it was revealed Wilkinson's 47-year-old mother, a former member of a punk rock band from Chatham, Kent, had travelled to Raqqa in Syria with her younger son to marry Islamic State fighter Junaid Hussain, 20, from Birmingham, who skipped bail to fight in Syria. It has since come out that Jones has been actively recruiting potential brides for other fighters, while in December she tweeted: 'May Allah destroy all those that cross us.' Punk rocker: Jones, a life-long benefits claimant, converted to Islam and fled the UK last year . Prosecuting, Paul Edwards told the hearing the flag was pulled from its pole before being burned, spat on and urinated over. The 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, arrived at court with his mum, and friend Wilkinson. 'I don't know why we did it to be honest,' the 14-year-old told the court. 'I didn't know they were going to burn it, I just thought they were going to take it down. 'I wanted to go but I also wanted to stay. 'I did hold them up to help but I didn't do any of the spitting or anything.' Twitter: Jones met her husband through the micro-blogging site, and remains an active user . Left behind: The 18-year-old's mother took her youngest son to Syria, but left her oldest at home . The defendant's mum told the court her son 'was in the wrong place at the wrong time'. She said: 'Jon, the other party, is here today to tell everyone that he did it and it was his idea. 'My son was there when he shouldn't have been but he didn't do it. 'He's a loving boy.' Defending, Sasha Queffurus said: 'He felt embarrassed when he didn't get involved because the others were telling him not to be uncool. 'But he knows he should have just gone home and he knows it was wrong. 'He wants to pay for the damage.' Sentencing, chairman of the bench Nigel Cox  said: 'It is a bit horrible.

Tweets: The mother-of-two married convicted hacker Junaid Hussain before travelling to the Middle East last year, and has since used her social media presence to encourage more girls to become jihadi brides . The 14-year-old will be supervised by the Youth Offenders team over this period and his parents were ordered to pay costs of £250 to the CPS, a victim surcharge of £15 and a third of the flag's damages at £16.66. The flag was found the day after the incident by local councillor Mike Taylor. Speaking at the time he said: 'Borough Green is proud of being British, and celebrates that by flying two Union Flags in the village, at the library and the crossroads. 'As a youth worker for many years I am largely immune to the occasional stupidity and vandalism perpetrated by young people, it's usually thoughtless high spirits aggravated by lager or pot, but I witnessed an act that chilled me.

Ed Miliband looks barely a couple of inches shorter than the Labour MP Toby Perkins, despite being almost half a foot shorter . When shadow business minister Toby Perkins proudly showed off his photo with the leader on his website though, something seemed amiss. The MP for Chesterfield, who is 6'6', has previously dwarfed Mr Miliband when they have been pictured together. Yet in the latest photograph, Mr Miliband, who just over six foot, appears to be almost the same height. It was rumoured that Mr Miliband had resorted to standing on a box or a phone book to improve his stature. But after Labour aides tonight categorically denied the suggestion, the mystery remained. Asked whether Mr Miliband been on a box, Mr Perkins told the Mail: 'No of course not.' Questioned further on what Mr Miliband had been standing on, he added, 'I want to know what you're on,' before ending the call. A spokesman for Mr Miliband later added that the only thing he had been stood on was the floor, but he refused to comment on whether Mr Perkins had been forced to crouch. He said: 'Ed was not stood on anything. He is over six foot tall and was not on a box.' At 6ft 6in Toby Perkins (pictured in yellow) is the perfect choice to keep goal for the Labour MPs' charity football team . Labour MPs were last week invited to have 'portrait photos' taken with Mr Miliband in his office, the website Guido Fawkes reported. However, it is not thought the party anticipated much demand as it only allowed 45 minutes for the pictures despite it having 256 MPs. Mr Perkins, who was elected in 2010, posted his picture with Mr Miliband with article on his website about Labour's pledge to reduce university tuition fees. After facing much ridicule for his bacon sandwich picture, Mr Miliband said in July last year: 'Here's the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo-op. And that culture diminishes our politics.' A Labour source said that Mr Miliband is around 6'1' to 6'2' tall. In 2010 it was claimed Nicolas Sarkozy had not seen the funny side after it was claimed David Cameron and George Osborne had both made jokes about his height while they were in opposition. Mr Cameron denied an accusation that he had mocked the former French president, who is around 5'5', by making a remark about 'hidden dwarfs' while referring to a picture of himself with Mr Sarkozy. Mr Osborne provoked laughter at a conference when he removed a stool from behind the lectern at which he was about to speak and joked that it was 'the Sarkozy box'. The BBC's Newsnight reported that French officials had complained that the two incidents, which came within a few days of each other, 'failed to show sufficient respect' for the French head of state.","The Labour leader is over 6ft tall but is dwarfed by MP Toby Perkins .

Yes, Jobs was brilliant. And yes, Jobs also could be a bastard. Isaacson's book contained numerous examples of Jobs' cruel behavior, such as verbally abusing employees whose work didn't meet his exacting standards. Now a new book is presenting a kinder, gentler portrait of the mercurial tech exec. ""Becoming Steve Jobs,"" by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli, seeks to humanize Jobs through interviews with those who knew him in the latter, wildly successful phases of his career, when some of his rough edges had softened. The book, which went on sale Tuesday, has created a strange irony. Unlike Isaacson's book, it's an unauthorized bio, one that was not given Jobs' blessing before he died. And yet Apple, mindful of Jobs' legacy, has clearly endorsed this new vision of their former CEO over the Isaacson version. ""I thought the Isaacson book did him a tremendous disservice. It was just a rehash of a bunch of stuff that had already been written, and focused on small parts of his personality,"" says current Apple CEO Tim Cook in the new book. ""You get the feeling that (Steve's) a greedy, selfish egomaniac. It didn't capture the person. The person I read about there is somebody I would never have wanted to work with over all this time. Life is too short."" Other Apple execs also have heaped praise on ""Becoming Steve Jobs"" while criticizing Isaacson's bestseller. ""Best portrayal is about to be released - Becoming Steve Jobs (book). Well done and first to get it right,"" tweeted Eddy Cue, Apple's chief of software, last week. And Jony Ive, Apple's head of design, said in a New Yorker profile last month, ""My regard (for Isaacson's book) couldn't be any lower."" Isaacson, for his part, told the New York Times recently that he tried to present a balanced view of Jobs: ""My book is very favorable and honest, with no anonymous slings,"" he said. Although Jobs' life and career have been well chronicled, the new book contains some fresh tidbits: . -- In 2009, when Jobs was dying of cancer, Cook offered his boss a piece of his liver but Jobs refused, saying, ""No, I'll never let you do that."" -- What was likely the last movie Jobs watched before his death was an odd choice: ""Remember the Titans,"" the sentimental Disney drama about a racially integrated high school football team in 1971. ""I was so surprised he wanted to watch that movie,"" Cook recalled. ""I was like, 'Are you sure?' Steve was not interested in sports at all."" -- And Jobs' famous commencement speech at Stanford University in 2005 almost got derailed before it started. A police officer turned him and his family away from the campus, saying the parking lot was full, and expressed skepticism that the scruffy Jobs, wearing his usual jeans and black T-shirt, was really the event's keynote speaker. Raves from Apple aside, early reviews of ""Becoming Steve Jobs"" have been mixed. ""'Becoming Steve Jobs' offers a more rounded portrait of the man not only because it doesn't lean as heavily on its interviews or stretch for historical weight like Isaacson's book, but because it brings in Schlender's personal interactions with the Apple co-founder,"" wrote Mic Wright for The Next Web. ""But the closeness of Schlender's connection with Jobs is also problematic,"" added Wright, saying ""... there's a sense of seeking to explain away bad behavior."" ""While the book never attempts to portray Jobs as a saint, it provides ample evidence to suggest that the brash, perpetually impatient young millionaire learned how to control his worst tendencies, eventually becoming a loving father and respected mentor,"" wrote Jeremy Horwitz in 9 to 5 Mac. ""Like other good books that have been written about Jobs, it doesn't provide the definitive story of his life, but instead adds some new and interesting details that are worth considering alongside what was previously known.""","New book, ""Becoming Steve Jobs,"" offers a gentler vision of the mercurial CEO .

But after getting the cold shoulder from his online ladylove when he turned up, he started drinking and was found suffering from hypothermia and unconscious on the staircase leading down into the Xu River. Scroll down for video . A lovesick American teenager (pictured) almost died after getting drunk and nearly drowning in a river when he was dumped by a young Chinese woman he flew 7000 miles to visit . The teen had met the girl online and promised that he would visit her. After getting the cold shoulder when he turned up, Pratt drank himself unconscious and was found on steps leading down into the Xu River . A spokesman from the Cheng Bei Police Station quoted on Qianjiang TV said: 'He was unconscious and lying in a pool of his own vomit. It looks as if he might have fallen in the water at some stage as his clothes and shoes were soaked. To be honest he was so inebriated, he could easily have drowned. It was only a short distance to the water.' Pratt was taken to a local hospital and after regaining consciousness discovered that he had also managed to lose all of his money meaning he could no longer pay for his hotel room. However after hearing about his hard luck story, the hotel manager decided to let the teenager have the room for free. He admitted to police that he did not know the girl's real name, only her online pseudonym which was Xiaoqian, and he also admitted he had only started talking to her this year.

Detectives confirmed from his mobile phone that he did try to ring her several times, after which he was told to leave her alone – and his number was blocked. Depressed about the rejection, Pratt had started drinking and was last seen cursing and staggering near Xu River, where he was found passed out later that night. Police tracked the young woman down, but she again refused to meet him despite hearing about the fact that he had almost died.

Speaking at a Tel Aviv press conference, retired Maj. Gen. Amnon Reshef, one of the founders of Commanders for Israel's Security, said the speech -- expected to take a hard line on Iran's nuclear ambitions -- is ""a terrible mistake"" that will further damage the relationship between the U.S. and Israel. He also said the speech could harm Israel's security by damaging Israel's relationship with other countries. On Friday, Meir Dagan, the former head of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, told one of the leading Israeli newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth: ""The person who has caused the greatest strategic damage to Israel on the Iranian issue is the prime minister."" Dagan, who was the director of Mossad from 2002 to 2010, continued, ""I've seen leaders who made decisions and then later admitted that they had erred. Nobody is immune from mistakes. The difference between him and others is the willingness to take responsibility. He is strong on talk, not in action."" Recent polling by CNN affiliate Channel 10 Israel shows Israelis split on the speech, with 38% supporting it and the same percentage opposing it. The remaining 24% are undecided. But another poll from Panels Politics, an Israeli polling institute, indicates 53% of Israelis believe the speech will have no effect on the negotiations between six world powers and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. Another 30% believe the speech will affect the negotiations. Reshef said this year's elections, which will take place on March 17, exactly two weeks after Netanyahu's speech, are crucial for the peace process. Even after years of failed negotiations, Israel has the opportunity now to restart negotiations with the help of moderate Arab states, he said, while warning that going the wrong direction could push peace further out of reach. Reshef would not specify which political leaders would be the best for negotiations, but he said he trusts Israeli voters to decide for themselves in the upcoming elections. Commanders for Israel's Security is a nonpartisan group of nearly 200 veteran senior security members from the Israel Defense Forces; Shin Bet, Israel's internal security agency; and the police. It is committed to a regional political-security initiative to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Radwanska seemed to have got back into it when she recovered to 3-2 in the second set, but Watson stopped her revival and held her nerve after breaking for 5-4 at the end . She was awaiting the winner of Carla Suarez Navarro and Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Meanwhile he friend and rival Robson has handed back the wildcard she had accepted into the qualifying event for next week’s Miami Open due to continuing concerns over her troublesome left wrist. Watson played a smart match to defeat Agnieszka Radwanska and reach the Indian Wells last 16 . Radwanska reached the final last year at the BNP Paribas Open but lost to Watson on Sunday . Watson keeps her eye on a forehand during her first top 10 player win over Agniesza Radwanska . VIDEO Williams continues California return as Watson stuns Radwanska . The former British number has not played for 14 months now, having last hit a ball in anger at the 2014 Australian Open and undergone surgery on wrist tendons early last summer. She had initially hoped to play in smaller events in California leading into Indian Wells, but has now had to postpone reappearing again with caution being the watchword. Robson is not said to have suffered any major setback but wants to be sure the area is strong enough to withstand the rigours of competition. A possible new target is a WTA event in Colombia next month but she has made it clear there will be no rushing back from what is the most infernal injury for tennis players. Watson's serve was performing well during the 93-minute win for the Brit in the BNP Paribas Open .","The Brit defeated the World No 8 6-4, 6-4 in an hour and a half .

Though large doses of a puffer's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect. To release the substance, the bottlenose dolphins were caught chasing the pufferfish along the ocean floor. In a bid to escape attack, footage shows the fish quickly inflating into a ball shape. The playful dolphins then grab the puffer between their teeth and pass it around until it eventually lets out a burst of poison. A brown-colored cloud is seen dispersing and diluting in the water.

Getting in on the act: Though large doses of a puffer's neurotoxinthe can be deadly - 100 times more potent than cyanide - in small amounts it is known to produce a narcotic effect . The footage, from Dolphins: Spy in the Pod, was taken by wildlife filmmaker John Downer - who has previously used hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television screens. Downer designed underwater cameras disguised as squid, tuna and even other dolphins. Zoologist and series producer Rob Pilley said that it was the first time dolphins had been filmed behaving this way. He added: 'We saw the dolphins handle the puffers with kid gloves, very gently and delicately like they were almost milking them to not upset the fish too much or kill it. 'As a result the fish released various toxins as a defense. The dolphins then seemed to be mesmerized.' He insisted that the scene couldn't have been a one-off encounter, saying: 'The dolphins were specifically going for the puffers and deliberately handling them with care.' The series, which aired on the Discovery Channel on Saturday, follows the success of Penguins: Spy In the Huddle, which used similar tactics of disguised cameras, documentary producer Downer was eager to create a range of cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented proximity to their favorite species.

As well as the Dolphincam, the Tunacam, Turtlecam and Squidcam have also been created for different spying roles, with each fitted with HD cameras to capture life under the sea. With the help of the cameras, viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water, as well as finding themselves at the center of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once. Some 900 hours of raw footage was collected over a 12-month period from locations including America, Coasta Rica, South Africa, Argentina and Australia. The pufferfish footage was filmed in waters near Mozambique. The film crew also dived some 1,500 times, spending nearly 3,000 hours at sea filming with the Spy Creatures in all types of weather. Speaking of the project, Downer said: 'Unlike Penguin-cams, this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast-moving dolphins, often out in the deep ocean. 'The dolphins were very curious about their new neighbors and allowed them into their lives.' Downer's last project, Spy in the Huddle, took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year.","Hidden cameras captured a pod in action as they got 'high' from nerve toxins released by a pufferfish in waters off Southeast Africa .

Frank Marra, 48, was not the only one who saw the specter, who a psychic medium has explained could have been a spirit, 'soul collector', guiding people to the afterlife, according to the New York Post. In his book, From Landfill to Hallowed Ground, Marra details his experience searching through rubble and remains of the World Trade Center attacks from September 2001 to February 2002 at Fresh Kills landfill. While there, volunteers found 54,000 personal objects and helped identify 1,200 people who perished.

He only saw her a few times and in the distance, more than 50 yards away each time, but he recalls that it clearly looked like a person. And while they were rare sightings, he stashed them away as memories, until about a year later when he spoke to a retired crime-scene detective who mentioned the ghost. The detective asked him if he ever heard stories about the 'old Red Cross worker trying to serve sandwiches and coffees out by the sifters', which brought Marra's memories of her rushing back to mind.

Called aurora borealis in the Northern Hemisphere and aurora australis in the Southern Hemisphere, the lights were the product of large geomagnetic blasts from the sun that arrived Tuesday about 10 a.m. ET (1 a.m. Wednesday in Sydney). Both the aurora borealis and the aurora australis were sparked by a particularly strong solar storm that sent charged particles toward the Earth, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. ""When these particles bombard the Earth's magnetic field in the upper atmosphere, the collision often creates brilliant colors,"" Borek said. ""Most of the time, auroras appear green -- when these particles collide with oxygen in the atmosphere -- but there were reports this past aurora australis also appeared to have a reddish tint, which suggested the collision with high-altitude oxygen was also seen on Earth."" Share your photos of the aurora with iReport . The stronger the storm, the farther south it can be seen, said Borek. And this geomagnetic storm was rather powerful, reaching as a high as a G4 on a scale from 1 to 5 Tuesday night, according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. The storm was expected to last 24 to 36 hours, and NOAA's latest reports say it's down to a G1. Though the storm could affect GPS technology and power grids, NOAA said Tuesday that it had no reports of disruptions. The most visible impact as been this stunning light display. If the auroras are seen again tonight, Borek said, they won't be as pronounced and most likely won't reach as far south as Tuesday night. People in northern Michigan, northern Minnesota and Maine may be able to spot them, although he warned that clouds from Minnesota to Montana may impede visibility Wednesday night.","A particularly strong solar storm created a stunning light display .

The pop superstar said it was 'hard' for her because all her friends and family supported the party - but said she already paid 'a f****** lot of tax' and needed to listen to what the other parties said. Mrs Fernandez-Versini, who has built up an estimated £20million fortune, said she was now a mature woman  and felt a greater responsibility to be well-informed about politics. Cheryl Fernandez-Versini said Mr Miliband proposed mansion tax on homes worth more than £2million would 'f*** me over' It came after 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked the Labour leader Ed Miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him. Other celebrities, including Myleene Klass, Angelina Jolie, Sol Campbell and Bill Oddie have also publicly criticised the Labour Party over the proposed Mansion Tax on expensive homes. But the popular X Factor judge's remarks are likely to particularly sting because of her life-long support for the Labour Party. David Cameron and George Osborne have also made tax cuts the centre of their pitch for re-election. The Tories want to clear the Government's £90billion deficit without any tax rises - while Labour has called for the rich to pay more. Mr Miliband has pledged to restore the 50p tax rate on those who earn more than £150,000, introduce an annual levy on homes worth more than £2million - dubbed the mansion tax - and raise the point at which high earners start paying 40 per cent of their income to the government. Mrs Fernandez-Versini told the Telegraph's Stella magazine that she would 'listen' more carefully to other parties now that she paid so much in tax. The 'Crazy Stupid Love' singer also suggested she could 'make my own party' adding that 'stranger things have happened'. 'It's hard for me, because all my friends and family vote Labour,' she said. Asked if she would consider voting for David Cameron, she replied: 'Not really. I want to hear what everyone's got to say. 'I've always been Labour all my life but I want to hear what they've got to say for myself. Now that I'm a mature woman. 'I feel like a greater responsibility now to vote for who runs our country. And I pay a f****** lot of tax. So I think that I need to have a really well-informed, well-educated opinion.' The 'staunchly Labour' TV stars Ant and Dec attacked Mr Miliband and questioned whether they could vote for him . The X Factor darling has built up a fortune since her pop career took off after being voted onto the pop band Girls Aloud on the 2002 TV show, Popstars The Rivals. Despite growing up on a council estate as one of five children in Newcastle, she now earns a reported £2million a year as a judge on X Factor and face of L'Oreal. Last year, she married French playboy Jean Bernard Fernandez Versini - who owns pop-up bar Cosy Box in Cannes. It came after she divorced England footballer Ashley Cole in 2010 citing ‘unreasonable behaviour’ after numerous allegations of cheating on his part. Despite her wealth Mrs Fernandez-Versini said there were 'big downsides that come with having money'. Ed Miliband's proposed mansion tax has been attacked by a string of celebrities . She said: 'As many as with not having money. I mean, they're different types of stresses, but they're both stresses.' Mrs Fernandez-Versini later claimed on Twitter that her remarks had been taken out of context, adding: 'I am a labour supporter, but will always want to hear what everyone has to say.' Her comments come after presenter Myleene Klass attacked Mr Miliband over the policy, claiming it would hit 'little grannies' whose homes had increased in value over decades, rather than the super rich. Actress Angelina Jolie said she could be 'put off' from moving to Britain by the proposal, which would come in this year if Labour wins on May 7. Mr Miliband was left bruised after And and Dec questioned whether he was up to be Prime Minister. Declan Donnelly, 39, said he had always voted Labour but was unimpressed with Mr Miliband. He said: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.' His Britain's Got Talent co-star Ant McPartlin – also 39 – said the pair were 'staunchly Labour' but didn't know if they could vote Labour under Mr Miliband. The remarks appear to echo public concern over Mr Miliband's leadership, with just 80 days until the election. According to the latest polls, more than half the public think Mr Miliband is doing a bad job – with less than a quarter happy with his leadership. His overall approval rating has slumped to minus 29. This is stark contrast to David Cameron – who splits opinion down the middle, according to the pollsters Opinium. The PM has a net approval rating of minus one. Despite Mr Cameron's personal advantage, Labour continue to be ahead by two points in the polls – on 35 per cent, compared to the Tories who are stuck on 33 per cent. Ant and Dec, speaking to the Times, said they followed politics 'keenly', but were disillusioned with Labour and the Tories. Mr McPartlin said: 'I voted Labour all my life. But last election I voted Tory because I was thoroughly disillusioned with the Labour government. 'Now I'm thoroughly disillusioned with a coalition government. I feel we're both staunchly Labour and would vote Labour if we could, but I don't know what their philosophy is any more.' Mr Donnelly added: 'I'm not sure I could picture him [Ed Miliband] as prime minister.'","Cheryl Fernandez-Versini said all her friends and family voted Labour .

Chris Mannion, 52, found old military papers which show his grandfather Lieutenant Sergeant Patrick Mannion caught Adolf Hitler's right-hand man. The evil Nazi was then the world's most wanted man and is known to have been found by a unit of four British and two Russian soldiers as he tried to flee Germany in 1945. An amateur historian has unearthed the identities of the men who captured top Nazi Heinrich Himmler (right) - discovering that one of them was his own grandfather, Lt Sgt Patrick Mannion (left) Himmler, who was one of the men responsible for the Holocaust and was head of the SS, was wearing an eye patch disguise and carrying a bag of money when he was captured. He was taken to a checkpoint, quizzed and moved to a camp where he was identified  - before killing himself. The names of his arresting officers has always been known but the four British men who first found him - from 196 Battery of the 73rd Anti-tank Regiment - had been shrouded in mystery. Mr Mannion, from Manchester, says he discovered who the men were when researching his grandfather's military career. He spent £30 accessing military service records of his grandfather - who he knew had served with 196 Battery. But he was stunned to find the records show Lt Sgt Patrick Mannion was one of the men who found Himmler. Historian Chris Mannion discovered documents (pictured) revealing his grandfather captured Himmler when researching his military career . An arrest report he was sent shows Himmler was picked up by one non-commissioned officer and three gunners. Mr Mannion says the documents show they were Gunner John Fletcher, Gunner Michael Faye, Gunner N Carlston and his own grandfather. The official records show one of the men fired a shot before Faye grabbed Himmler - and the group led him to the checkpoint. Mr Mannion now plans to publish the records and his findings in an upcoming book about Himmler's capture - and the men who found him. He said: 'As a young boy I looked up to him for being a soldier, and would play with his medals and bits and pieces he brought back from the war. 'I never knew what he had done in the war, I was always curious, but no one could tell me for certain. 'In the end I set out to find out myself. There was a rumour in the family about a high-ranking Nazi official but I didn't think in a million years I would find out anything like this. 'I decided to get his service records, paid £30, and was sent 2,600 pages. They had the records of the capture of Himmler - and there was my grandfather's name.' When Himmler received the news of Hitler's death, he travelled to Flensburg where he remained for the first week of May. On May 15, 1945 he dismissed his staff and left with his two companions for a hide-out in the Harz Mountains. The three men set out on foot, moving across country, seeking cover in the woods, and sleeping in sheds or haystacks. The four British men who first found him - from 196 Battery of the 73rd Anti-tank Regiment (pictured, with Lt Sgt Mannion third from right, front row) - has been shrouded in mystery . Himmler's group were stopped on several occasions but managed to bluff their way through, until they tried to cross through Meinstedt on May 21. When they were about to travel through Meinstedt they were surprised by a British patrol of the four men from 196 Battery. They tried to evade capture but, after warning shots were fired, they stopped to be searched, taken to a military checkpoint and detained. Over the following two days, Himmler was moved to several camps and then the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, south of Hamburg, where he admitted who he was. A doctor tried to examine him but Himmler bit into a cyanide pill he had concealed, collapsing and dying shortly afterwards. Mr Mannion's documents showed that his grandfather fought in Normandy, Belgium, Holland and Germany. He landed in Normandy the day after D-Day, and was also involved in peacekeeping after the war, routinely patrolling Germany arresting fleeing Germans and preventing further unrest. According to the files, it was on one such patrol that Lt Sgt Mannion and three other members of his patrol stumbled across the group of Germans, who were acting suspiciously. Himmler (left) - one of the men responsible for the Holocaust and head of the SS - was Adolf Hitler's right-hand man . The report reads: 'On 21 May 45, at about 1930 hrs, one of the patrols which the Regt sent out daily to neighbouring villages, saw three men emerging from a wood, at Meinstedt. 'The patrol hailed the men, and when they failed to stop, fired a warning shot. 'The three men then approached. As they held no allied release permits, the serjeant in charge of the patrol sent them back by truck.' The amateur historian said: 'The report says that Himmler was in disguise with an eye patch, having grown a beard. 'What gave it away was his papers were just too correct, they were brand new, and he also had a bag stuffed full of money, it's all in the report. 'He had two men with him, who were obviously SS, and they knew Himmler wasn't who he said he was, so they handed him over.' Mr Mannion, who never met his grandfather, added: 'I was proud of him anyway, for going to fight for his country as millions did, but this is just the icing on the cake. 'It took me a few weeks just to take it in, all the pictures of Himmler now I can't see it in the same way, because my granddad caught him. 'When you see the records you realise they did momentous things, it's really something to be proud of. It's made me feel closer to my grandfather. I'm in awe of him.' Lt Sgt Mannion died in in 1948 following complications of injuries sustained in the war. The son of a school teacher, Heinrich Himmler was born in Munich on October 7, 1900, and went on to become the architect of the Holocaust and one of the Nazi party's most dreadful chiefs. His first involvement with the Nazis was in 1923, and he was their propaganda leader between 1926 and 1930. He was made head of the S.S. - the Schutzstaffel - a major  organisation and Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguard, which became one of the most powerful organisations under his leadership during the Third Reich. Himmler developed it from a 290-man battalion to a huge group with its own military. He became president of the Gestapo (Secret State Police) once the Nazis had come to power in 1933, and set up the very first Nazi concentration camp, Dachau, the same year. Himmler was obsessed with the idea of the Germans as the Aryan race and racial purification and encouraged Aryans to only breed with each other in special programmes he set up. During the Second World War, after Hitler had successfully invaded Poland, he was able to force more than a million Poles and 300,000 Jews out of the west of the country. In 1941, Himmler was present at the shooting of 100 Jews by firing squad in Minsk. He deciding that having to witness such killings might affect the mental health of his S.S. men, and declared that alternative methods of genocide be found. In 1942 he was charged with control of 'the final solution to the Jewish problem' - the Holocaust. He was given control of the concentration camps, including Auschwitz, and by spring that year it was greatly expanded to include gas chambers. In total, close to six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. When it became clear that the Nazis were going to lose the war, Himmler attempted to bargain with the Allies, and Hitler consequently stripped him of all his duties. After the surrender he used a fake identity to try and escape, but was captured. He committed suicide while being held by the allied forces on May 23, 1945, by swallowing a cyanide capsule.","Chris Mannion discovered his grandfather captured Nazi Heinrich Himmler .

That's not looking such a gamble now. Nineteen goals later during one of the most breathtaking and honest seasons in recent memory, he's level with Diego Costa. Kane is with Roy Hodgson's England squad this week and can lay claim to being the country's only genuinely complete frontman. STATS Scroll down to see a full breakdown of Harry Kane's 19 goals . Harry Kane - pictured scoring against Leicester City on Saturday - has netted 19 times this season . Kane is training with the England team at St George's Park for the first time this week . Kane's goals have come from a variety of angles in what has been a staggering season for Spurs . Graphics were provided by Squawka. His international team-mates who share St George's Park with him in the coming days will doubtless notice the 21-year-old's range of ability. Kane is as comfortable 25 yards from goal as he is in the penalty area – and the visuals of his stunning campaign tell the whole story. Predominantly right-footed, it's little wonder that 10 of his strikers have come that way, but Mauricio Pochettino – and now Hodgson – will be enthused at the other ways in which he finds the net. Kane's spike of goals came around Christmas and he has added more headers and left-footed strikes recently . Kane (celebrating scoring against Aston Villa in November) has been in stunning form for Spurs . Brad Guzan had no chance after Kane's free-kick swerved beyond him at Villa Park . Four have come via his head, with five slammed home with his weaker left peg. Nine goals have been netted from more than 12 yards out. Those include a 29-yard hit in the 5-3 win against Chelsea on New Year's Day, and that stunning swerving free-kick at Aston Villa earlier in November. Compare that to Wayne Rooney, who has 11 for the season - nine of which came with his favoured right. His goals have contributed 22 points to Spurs charge towards the top four, too. Kane's rise to prominence has been staggering and, with five goals in his last three, is in prime position to pip the injured Costa and send the bookies into a sulk.","Harry Kane is level with Chelsea's Diego Costa on 19 goals .
The Spurs striker is training with England for the first time this week .
Kane has netted 10 of his 19 with his right foot .","Concise Factual Bullet Points:

Busch was suspended after a Delaware civil court found that he probably committed domestic violence against his former girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll. She accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at Delaware's Dover International Speedway in September. Twice, the NASCAR 2004 Cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times. That meant he missed the season-opening Daytona 500 as well as two subsequent Sprint Cup races. But he should be able to compete through the fall, and NASCAR says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events. The case against Busch took a significant turn last week, when the Delaware Department of Justice announced that charges would not be filed against him. ""As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse,"" Busch said then. ""I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life."" A Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February that Busch must stay away from Driscoll for a year. NASCAR officials decided to lift Busch's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit's reinstatement program, completed behavioral assessments and got the OK from a behavioral health care expert to race again. He's not totally out of the woods. In a news release, NASCAR said Busch must ""undergo additional steps to address the behavior for which he was penalized."" Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer, said the lack of charges against Busch expedited his return. ""We have made it very clear to Kurt Busch our expectations for him moving forward, which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements as a result of his off-track behavior,"" O'Donnell said.

Phil Parkinson of League One Bradford City would probably be inclined to disagree. On Monday night, the Valley Parade side will kick off their 37th cup tie in the last four seasons when they travel to Reading for an FA Cup quarter-final replay. Phil Parkinson has had terrific success in cup competitions with Bradford City in the last four years . Since taking over in August 2011, Parkinson has led his side to an average extra 10 games each campaign as Bradford have reached the Capital One Cup final and enjoyed lengthy runs in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and FA Cup. These exploits have seen them play 37 cup ties on top of their four 46-game league campaigns during Parkinson's tenure — almost an additional Premier League season's worth of fixtures. Bradford have vanquished no fewer than five top-flight sides — Wigan, Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Sunderland — beaten 14 higher-division teams and won 21, drawn four and lost just 11 ties in total. They also have a 100-per-cent record in penalty shootouts under Parkinson, winning all seven they have contested. Bradford reached the Capital One Cup final in 2013 where they were beaten by Swansea City . And far from sidelining their progress in the league, this rich experience of knockout football helped Bradford win promotion to League One via the play-offs in 2013. Their victory over Northampton at Wembley was their second visit to the national stadium that year after Capital One Cup final defeat to Swansea, and was their 64th game in all competitions. Even if they can't secure a third trip down Wembley Way at the Madjeski Stadium, Bradford are still firmly in the hunt for promotion to the Championship — sitting just three points off sixth place with a game in hand.

She is best known as the society beauty who attended the same school as the Duchess of Cambridge and now organises sex parties for young actors and models. And now Emma Sayle, founder of the Killing Kittens parties is taking her events to New York City, it has been reported. Miss Sayle has been hosting the parties for the ‘sexual elite’ at secret, upmarket locations, which include discreet boutique hotels in Surrey, country estates in Berkshire and West Sussex, and luxury penthouses in London and LA. Those who hope to gain access must be aged between 18 and 45 and must either be a single girl or part of a couple. Applications are made via the Killing Kittens website and must be accompanied by a photograph. Now the New York Post has reported that the first Killing Kittens party will take place in a rented loft in Manhattan near to the Flatiron building on Saturday. It is thought around 60 people have already signed up to attend the party, including bankers and models. She told the newspaper: 'Statistically, New York is in our favour for it to work. 'It might help with all the frustration of all those women who can’t find men. They can come and share the men!' An event in Los Angeles is also set to take place at the weekend. Ms Sayle went to Downe House, the all-girls public school in Berkshire where Kate Middleton was also briefly a pupil. The entrepreneur then attended the University of Birmingham, where she first started organising parties and charities events. After graduating, she did a stint in the City before gravitating towards PR. It was then that she became acquainted with the sex-party industry. She also joined the Duchess in a dragon boat team called the Sisterhood for a charity race in 2007. Ms Sayle attended the same public girls school as the Duchess of Cambridge. They are pictured together in 2007 taking part in a dragon boat race for charity . Her first Killing Kittens event took place in Covent Garden, Central London, in 2005. Since then she has expanded the business across the UK, and has staged parties in the United States, with plans to host events in Australia and New Zealand. Speaking last year and referring to her UK Killing Kittens parties, which are aimed at those aged between 18 and 45, Ms Sayle said: ‘We've have had a few MPs and famous singers. 'We haven’t had any Royals yet but there have been a few A-list actors and actresses – but I couldn't reveal who.’ Last year, she also revealed how she had expanded her parties to cater for older people over the age of 45.

Like their younger counterparts attending Ms Sayles’s Killing Kittens parties, would-be Silver Kittens must submit a recent photograph of themselves with their application forms. Only the good-looking are invited and they must be aged 45 or over. About 80 guests aged up to 60, wearing black tie or cocktail dresses, ate oysters and chocolates and sipped champagne before ‘retiring’ to candle-lit boudoirs. At the time she told the Mail on Sunday: 'Our first event went really well. The oldest person there was a guy aged 60, but he was in good shape. He had an air of confidence – sexiness comes down to confidence. ‘You can get a lot of stunning catwalk models in their 20s who are not confident. There’s nothing sexy about them.

Medical experts claim the image of a broken leg depicts injuries consistent with a history of violence on a child aged three to five. The advert was launched by Ed Miliband's party last week accusing the Tories of wanting to cut the NHS 'to the bone', despite Tory assurances that the health budget would be protected. Labour launched the poster last week claiming the Conservative party would not protect the health service from cuts . The controversial image was unveiled on Friday by shadow chancellor Ed Balls and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham as Labour's 'first poster of the 2015 general election campaign'. It showed the x-ray of a broken leg bone, under the headline: Next time, they'll cut to the bone.' It also featured the tagline: 'The NHS can't afford the Tory cuts plan.' But medics immediatly recognised the image as potentially showing the impact of repeated injuries suffered by an abuse victim. Labour stressed that the poster was designed by an external advertising agency, which used an image from a picture agency. But experts said it appeared to be 'very likely non-accidental injury', suggesting the broken bone could have been inflicted intentionally. Prof Christopher Colton, emeritus consultant in orthopaedic and accident surgery, Nottingham University Hospital, told the Telegraph: 'If that X-ray presented itself at a hospital, all the alarm bells would ring for possible non-accidental injury. 'There are absolutely clear two episodes of violence and possibly the bone bruise is a third.' Tory MP Julian Smith said: 'Labour must explain what due diligence they did to ensure their advert isn’t based on any child’s tragedy. The tone of their poster is unpleasant enough, I hope the provenance of the image is less toxic.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham and shadow chancellor Ed Balls unveiled the poster in Harlow, Essex on Friday . The x-ray shows a very recent break in the middle of the leg, but there is healed fracture above the ankle which could be three to four weeks old. There is also a 'slight white haze' in the centre of the leg bone suggesting a healed bone bruise or fracture which is around five to six weeks old. A Labour party spokesman said: 'This image is a stock photograph provided by one of the world's biggest picture agencies.​' Peter Dazeley, the photographer credited on the Getty image, could not verify where it came from. Mr Balls and Mr Burnham used the poster to launch a highly political attack on the Tory party. Mr Balls said: 'George Osborne's Budget set out plans for deeper and more extreme spending cuts after the election. 'Our NHS just can't afford these extreme and risky Tory cuts. And after their broken promises on the NHS in this Parliament nobody will trust what the Tories say about the NHS.'","Labour launched poster claiming the NHS faced a 'Tory cuts plan'

A multi-million pound masterpiece by 16th century artist El Greco has been reunited with its rightful owners more than seven decades after it was stolen by the Nazis. El Greco's 'A Portrait of a Gentleman' had been missing ever since the Gestapo raided the collection of Jewish banker Julius Priester in 1944. Mr Priester, a prominent art collector, had fled to Paris with his wife Camilla six years before, when Austria was annexed into Germany as part of the Anschluss in 1938. The couple, who moved to Mexico City two years later, never gave up hope of finding the 50 precious works which had been stolen. When the war ended in 1945, Mr Priester set about trying to recover his collection - a hunt his heirs took up on his death in 1954. That determination to trace it has been rewarded after a 70 year search, when it was discovered on sale through a London art dealer last year. Although the value of the painting's value is unknown, the world record price for an El Greco is £9.2million. But it seems the emotional reward may have been even greater. When they were finally reunited with the oil painting, Mr Priester's heirs were thrilled to see it was still in the same frame it had when it was hanging above the dresser in the couple's Vienna dining room. Anne Webber, co-chair of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which helped reunite the Priesters with the painting, revealed they were 'absolutely delighted' to get it back. 'It was very moving when they saw it for the first time - it was still in the same frame it was in when it hung in Mr Priester's apartment,' she said. 'It has taken more than 70 years to reunite the painting with its rightful owners and we are delighted for the family.' Mr Priester's art collection, comprising of pieces by celebrated artists including Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony Van Dyke, was just one of many plundered from wealthy Jews on direct orders from Hitler. When the Nazis were defeated in 1945, Mr Priester set about trying to track down the whereabouts of his stolen art. He spent the best part of a decade searching for the art, working with the Austrian authorities to spread the word around the world. Reunited: The painting, which hung in the dining room, pictured, is still in its original frame . In 1953, the Austrian Federal Police wrote to Mr Priester to say his missing El Greco painting had been sold by the Gestapo to New York art brokers Knoedler, arriving in the city in 1952. However the dealer Frederick Mont refused to comply, denying all knowledge of the painting and thereby halting the investigation. Domenikos Theotokopoulos, better known as 'El Greco', was born in 1541 in Crete, into a wealthy family. He began his career as an 'icon painter', and by 1563, he was described as a 'master'. About four years later, he moved to Venice where he developed his intense, colourful mannerist style. He remained in the city until about 1570, before moving to Rome - the heart of the art world at the time. Here he studied the works of Michealangelo and Raphael, and continued to develop his own style. But it was during his time in Toledo, in Spain, where he moved in 1577, when he would produce his best works - even being commissioned by King Philip II. El Greco died in April 1614, but his genius was not recognised until the 20th century, when his work began to be noticed by the art world. Nowadays, an El Greco painting can sell for millions . But Ms Webber revealed: 'It turns out Knoedler had the painting for more than 30 years and showed it worldwide with a false provenance. 'It spent 13 years in London before going to a Swiss private collector in 2003.' When Mr Priester died in 1954 aged 84, his family picked up the search and continued investigations into the missing artwork. In 2005 the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, a non-profit organisation which helps track down stolen art, were called into help with the search. A breakthrough came last year when the commission discovered the El Greco listed for sale in a gallery in New York via a London art dealer - and a claim was immediately put in for it. 'The dealer acted admirably as soon as he realised the painting's true history and we were able to negotiate a deal to return the painting to Mr Priester's heirs, who now live in Britain,' said Ms Webber. Christopher A. Marinello, CEO of Art Recovery International, which represented the art dealer the painting was acquired from, added: 'This case proves that equitable restitution of looted works is attainable. 'Without the strength and precision of the historic claim on one side and the compliance and co-operation of the gallery on the other, this would never have been possible.' Julius Priester was a banker and president of Austrian petrol firm Petroleumgesellschaft Galizin. He began collecting art in the 1920s, building up a notable gallery. The Commission for Looted Art in Europe, a non-profit organisation, has helped return more than 3,500 pieces of stolen artwork to their rightful owners since it launched in 1999.","El Greco's 'Portrait of a Gentleman' seized by Gestapo from Vienna in 1944 .

And looking ahead to the Nou Camp encounter Messi, who has scored more Clasico goals than anyone else in the history of the fixture, describes the occasion as one to relish. 'The Clasico, which is coming up later in this month, is obviously a special game,' he told FourFourTwo Magazine. 'It's important for what it means to everyone involved, from the players to the fans. 'It's an event all around the world. As a player, though, you have to treat it like any other game. Like any derby, there's something extra to the game. 'They're amazing to play in and it's a fixture I've been very lucky to score a lot of goals in. 'I think on the international stage, Brazil vs Argentina is similar to Real Madrid v Barca.

But he insists he is ready to battle for his World Cup starting place and is also determined to inject some much-needed confidence into club-side Harlequins' stuttering season. Twelve months ago Brown concluded a Six Nations campaign that ended with an identical result, a second place in the table behind Joe Schmidt's Ireland. But he was also a winner, edging out retiring legend Brian O'Driscoll to be named player of the tournament, with four tries underlining his commitment to the cause. Mike Brown in action against France in the final Six Nations game of the tournament . This time around, there were no personal accolades to dull the disappointment of a fourth consecutive runners-up place. However, Brown believes the manner of England's memorable 55-35 victory over France is a reason to be optimistic ahead of this autumn's Rugby World Cup. But he refutes suggestions by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie that another second place was 'unacceptable'. 'I haven't done too much reflecting but it's massively disappointing to end the way that we did,' said Brown, speaking at the Rosslyn Park HSBC National Schools Sevens - the world's largest schools rugby tournament. 'It was great how we went about the game and how we won but it's disappointing that we didn't achieve our goal of winning it. It's the fourth time I've been involved where I've come second but luckily I don't get bitter. Brown was disappointed with how the Six Nations ended, but says there were positives to take . 'We'll keep going as a squad, keep using things like this to develop us. There are still positives to take out of it and we have to look at the bigger picture.' The free-scoring, free-flowing nature of last weekend's classic at Twickenham was compared by many to a rugby league game. Brown is an admitted fan of the 13-man code and Quins famously released a statement titled 'Brown stays with rugby' when he briefly flirted with a switch. However, Brown believes he has done enough in recent weeks to cement his place as Stuart Lancaster's first choice full-back, ahead of rival Alex Goode, who deputised when he missed the defeat in Dublin after picking up a head injury early in the win over Italy. 'I was very happy with my tournament. When I actually played, I thought I did well,' added Brown, who was casting his eye over the next generation of stars at Rosslyn Park – an event that has previously produced the likes of Gareth Edwards, Lawrence Dallaglio, Will Carling, and Ugo Monye. 'I think my game has come on loads this season. Last year it was all about my running game but I think I've shown that my kicking game has come on alongside my passing game and my defensive game. As long as I can keep improving, I will be happy. Brown will not be in action for Harlequins when they face Saracens at Wembley on Saturday . 'It's just a shame that I did take a knock and missed one a three quarter games, including the big one in Ireland. 'We've spoken about competition for places and 15 is definitely one that is strongly contested. Alex did well, unfortunately he was in that losing team against Ireland but he did well with his opportunity. 'Saying that, I don't want to give him too many opportunities – he is a great player so it is good to have that rivalry and push each other in training. 'Maybe before people might have said he had a better kicking game but I think after this tournament, people can see my kicking game isn't too bad either.' Brown and Goode should be going head-to-head at Wembley this weekend when the two sides clash in front of what is expected to be a world record crowd for a club rugby match. Brown talking to young rugby players at the Rosslyn Park HSBC National Schools Sevens . But Brown is sidelined again due to another concussion precaution, after picking up a knock late in the famous win over France. 'We're being a little cautious with that and we're giving it time to recover,' he said. 'After a head knock it's always a big thing to come back playing, especially with two internationals it can be tough. 'I've got next week off because we don't have a game so it's a good two weeks down time. 'It's not been a good campaign for Harlequins and this game could hopefully spark our season. We've worked well at times but we haven't been consistent and don't deserve to be up there. 'That's something to look at in the off season but there's still games to go where we can put ourselves in a good position to be in Europe for next year and that's definitely where we want to be – at the top table of European rugby.'

First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. An influential committee of MPs said that if Royal Mail wanted to increase profits, it must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency, rather than simply increase prices. First and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on March 30, sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging parcel revenues. Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices. Citizens Advice Bureau also urged Royal Mail to ‘focus on making efficiency savings rather than relying upon raising prices’ and expressed concern that consumers were held to ransom because they ‘have no choice but to pay the increased prices’. The cost of posting a large letter weighing up to 100g first class will rise by 2p to 95p. Royal Mail has warned it faces aggressive competition in the parcels market from delivery firm Whistl and called for regulators to rein in its rivals. The company says it is at a disadvantage to competitors because it must fulfil a 175-year-old ‘universal service’ obligation to deliver to all UK addresses for the same price. It said this obligation, which requires it to deliver six days a week to even the most rural communities, could soon become ‘financially unsustainable’ if Ofcom does not impose restrictions on its rivals. But the Business Committee will say today that there is no ‘immediate risk’ to the service and that, far from being a ‘burden’, the service brings ‘revenue and status’ to Royal Mail. A new report says: ‘Royal Mail should not increase postal and packaging prices simply in an attempt either to increase its own profit levels or to protect the Universal Service Obligation, without increasing the efficiency of its operations. ‘While we accept that Royal Mail has done much to improve efficiency, it still has to match the technical innovations introduced by many competitors — innovations that more clearly match the expectations of consumers.’ Adrian Bailey, chairman of the Business Select Committee, said he was ‘not very pleased’ to hear they had taken the ‘easy option’ of raising stamp prices . John Allan, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the rise in stamp prices would be unwelcome for many companies. He said: ‘While prices have only gone up by a penny, this still represents an above inflation rise. ‘Businesses affected will still have to decide whether to absorb this rise or pass it on to their customers.’ They said they expected Royal mail to use the additional money raised ‘to invest in improving their performance and meet delivery targets’. Mr Allan added: ‘Ofcom should carefully monitor how Royal Mail is doing, and use their powers to fine should customers’ expectations fail to be met.’ Since 1840, everyone in Britain, from the Cornish coast to the Scottish Highlands, has paid the same price to post a letter. Royal Mail says this expensive obligation is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfil because firms such as Whistl ‘cherry pick’ deliveries in more lucrative city locations and can therefore under-cut them on price. But when asked for evidence that it cost more to deliver in certain geographical areas, the company was apparently unable to provide this. Bailey felt the Royal Mail should be trying to make efficiencies instead of raising prices . The report said: ‘We were concerned to note that Royal Mail were unable to provide a regional breakdown of the cost of the Universal Service Obligation. ‘We also surprised to learn that there is no consensus between Royal Mail and Ofcom over what constitutes to cost, revenues and profits of the universal service.’ The report did concede that there could be a future risk to the universal service, however, ‘given the rapidly changing postal sector market’. It said Ofcom, the postal regulator, may need additional regulatory powers to ensure the future of the service. Mr Bailey said: ‘The universal postal service is available to everyone living in every part of the United Kingdom. It is an essential service to many people, especially those living in rural areas, to those less able to travel, to older people, and also to blind and partially-sighted people. ‘While our evidence indicated the universal service is not under immediate threat, we believe Ofcom needs to outline in more detail how it would respond quickly to changes in postal market conditions which may endanger the universal service.’ The Committee also called on Ofcom to help combat any ‘race to the bottom’ with regards to postal workers’ wages. It recommended Ofcom investigates the impact of providing the universal service on workers’ wages and conditions. An Ofcom spokesman said it had the powers to 'step in quickly to protect the needs of UK postal users' if a situation ever arose. Meanwhile, a Royal Mail spokesman said they welcomed the report, and shared in some of the committee's concerns and contribution - including the fact 'Ofcom may not be able to respond fast enough to avoid a failure in the Universal Service, even in the short term'. The spokesman added: 'We recognise and accept the Committee’s finding that Royal Mail has done much to improve efficiency, but there is still more for us to do to match the most efficient postal operators. We are continuing to invest in our business transformation programme and are becoming even more efficient.’ Last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable said Royal Mail should stop ‘whinging’ about its obligation to deliver to all parts of the country and accused it of ‘scaremongering’ by claiming its future was in jeopardy.","First and second-class stamps to rise by penny to 63p and 54p each .

He added: 'He holds numerous leadership positions on grounds, including Vice Chair for Community Relations of the Honor Committee, Vice Polemarch of the Eta Sigma Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, and a Chair of the Leadership Development Committee of the Black Student Alliance. He has no criminal record. 'As evidenced by both his academic and extracurricular achievements, Martese is a smart young man with a bright future,' Watkins said. 'I have spoken with him several times today, and he is absolutely devastated by yesterday's events. Currently, we are preparing to investigate and defend this matter vigorously. 'Please keep Martese in your prayers during this difficult time.' Though he's a college junior, Johnson is under the legal drinking age. According to Charlottesville General District Court records, Johnson was charged with obstruction of justice without force, and public swearing or intoxication. He was treated at the hospital before being released. University Vice President for Diversity and Equity Marcus L. Martin and Dean of African-American Affairs Maurice Apprey described the incident in a message to students and staff as 'appalling' and said the student's head was 'slammed into the hard pavement with excessive force.' 'This was wrong and should not have occurred,' Martin and Apprey said in a written statement. 'We view the nature of this assault as highly unusual and appalling based on the information we have received.' The ABC issued a statement saying that 'uniformed ABC Agents observed and approached' an unidentified individual 'after he was refused entry to a licensed establishment' about 12:45 a.m. at an area of bars and restaurants near campus known as 'the Corner.' The ABC said the unidentified individual received injuries while being arrested and was treated at a local hospital before being released. The ABC said the agents involved with the arrest are being restricted to administrative duties while a state police investigation is underway. ABC agents in Charlottesville have been accused of heavy-handed actions in the past. The state of Virginia reached a $212,500 settlement last year with a UVA student who was arrested after her purchase of water was mistaken for beer. Elizabeth Daly fled in terror outside a Charlottesville supermarket in April 2013 when her vehicle was swarmed by state ABC agents who mistook her just-purchased carton of sparkling water for beer. According to Daly's lawsuit, badges worn around the casually dressed ABC agents' necks were not clearly visible and the defendants did not verbally identify themselves as officers. Daly was charged with eluding police and assaulting a police officer after her SUV grazed two of the agents. The arrest provoked a public outcry, and the charges were dropped.","Martese Johnson, a junior,  was arrested after being denied entry a bar .

Matthew and Cheryl Jewell have had enough of 'embarrassing' noises coming from the sex club above their Stovestore business in Chorley, Lancashire. Despite their attempts to drown out the sounds, they claim customers are being driven away by the noises, which start around lunchtime. Matthew and Cheryl Jewell (pictured) claim it is 'embarrassing' when customers in their shop can hear screaming from upstairs . Mrs Jewell said: 'Customers are stood here and they're screaming upstairs. I'm going red, customers are going red and they're leaving the shop. 'We've spent thousands of pounds here and we're going to have to leave. We have so many customers that return to us here.' Despite their protestations, a representative of the No 3 swingers club, which has been open for two years, claims they are doing nothing wrong. No 3 Club owner, who said she only wanted to known as Mary, said she had suggested soundproofing, and had changed a day the club opened so it did not conflict with when the Stovestore was open. She said: 'I've done everything I possibly can. I don't want them to move. I don't think they like my type of business. They knew what it was before they moved in. 'I'm very disappointed and quite upset they're moving. I'll be sorry. I don't want to interfere with anybody else's business.' Problems began for Mr and Mrs Jewell when the No 3 Club expanded its opening hours into the working day, as well as its late night and early hours opening. 'It's more frequent now, they're open from 1pm onwards,' said Mrs Jewell. 'We were changing all our days for when they were noisiest. 'We know what's going on up there, but we can't do anything about it. Nobody can help.' The club website advertises the first Wednesday of every month as 'greedy girl day' beginning at midday . The Jewell's business The Stovestore (pictured) may be forced to close due to the noises from upstairs . The couple, who have owned the shop for two years, have complained to Chorley Council, but say their only option is to leave. Mrs Jewell added: 'We've made a couple of complaints, but there's no law for sexual activities. It's two years now just wasted.' According to the No 3 Club website, daytime activities include 'greedy girl day', which takes place on the first Wednesday of every month, between noon and 10pm. The two businesses share a landlord, Frank Patterson, who said he has asked No 3 Club to take steps improve the situation. Mr Patterson said: 'The No 3 Club came into the unit five years ago, Cheryl and Matthew have been there two years. There were two other tenants before them and it wasn't a problem. 'Now the No 3 Club has extended its hours into the working day. 'I've heard the noises and it's not acceptable. I've spoken to the No 3 Club about it on numerous occasions on behalf of Cheryl and Matthew and they've made no effort to improve the situation. If anything it's got worse.' He added: 'I've written to the No 3 Club and, if and when they renew their lease, I've told them there will be a restriction on them operating during the working day.' Councillor Paul Walmsley, from Chorley Council, said: 'The council has received a complaint about the No.3 Club, but as both parties are commercial premises, we do not have the powers to enforce nuisance proceedings. 'We will, however, continue to ensure they are compliant with their licence agreement as we would do with any other premises.'","Couple claim the noises from upstairs swingers club are 'embarrassing'

A council manager who retired from her £160,000-a-year job after the deaths of four children only to take a new social services job has been sacked after a fresh scandal, MailOnline can reveal today. Elaine McHale lost her £110,000-a-year job at Leicester City Council after her team failed to allocate social workers to look after hundreds of vulnerable children. Leicester's Labour mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has said Ms McHale was sacked after her 'botched review' caused her social services department to 'fall apart', which could have put children in the city at risk. But MailOnline can reveal that she moved to Leicester despite retiring from her £159,346-a-year job (total remuneration including pension contribution) at Wakefield Borough Council in 2012 as it emerged that the deaths of four children were being investigated. One of the serious case reviews probed by child protection experts was the murder of five-year-old Haroon Bhatti by his father Pazeer Ahmed, who burnt then beat his son to death. Ms McHale announced she was retiring from her job as director for family services a day after Ahmed was jailed for life, the council said the timing was coincidental. Another of the reviews considered whether the authorities could have stopped the murder of eight-week-old  Grace Barnes, who had her skull crushed  by her father Richard  in November 2011 after getting drunk on  beer, whisky and vodka. Wakefield Council insisted Ms McHale's retirement  had been spoken about for 'some time' before the four serious case reviews were announced. But instead of retiring completely she then moved to Leicester City Council as Strategic Director Adult Social Care and Health earning between £110,000 and £115,000-a-year until her departure on Friday. Revealing her sacking, Sir Peter Soulsby said there had been a 'complete failure' to inform the council's leadership about the scandal, which meant Elaine McHale was dismissed with immediate effect. He added that her management meant 'children have potentially been put at risk and this cannot be tolerated'. Cases: Mrs McHale retired from Wakefield Council in the wake of four serious case reviews, including Pazeer Ahmed's (left) murder of his child Haroon Bhatti and Richard Barnes' murder of his baby Grace (right) Ms McHale was sacked with cabinet member Vi Dempster after the council was presented with a draft report of a recent Ofsted inspection of its social services department. Inspectors found that a poorly-managed review of front-line social workers carried out in the summer of 2014 by Ms McHale 'resulted in more than 30 leaving the authority  during which time vulnerable children were put at risk by not being allocated the social workers they needed', the council said today. Critics have today demanded an end to the 'merry-go-round' at the top of councils where staff on huge salaries are allowed to resign or retire after scandals only to quickly find a new 'cushy' job. Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's bad enough when taxpayers foot the bill for enormous salaries at town halls, but it's quite another when they are paying rewards for failure. 'What really angers hard-working taxpayers, though, is when council top brass are removed from their post but find themselves in a cushy role elsewhere in the public sector. More has to be done to bring this merry-go-round to a grinding halt.' After her recent sacking Ms McHale has also been suspended as  chairman of the  Bradford Safeguarding Children Board, a role where she could charge up to £500-per-day for her services. She was offered the job last year despite concerns over whether she was as suitable appointment but was removed from her post today. A Bradford Council spokesman said: 'This morning Bradford Safeguarding Children Board (BSCB) and Bradford Council have become aware that Elaine McHale's interim contract as Director of Adult Services at Leicester City Council has been terminated. 'Following discussions with Ms McHale, it has been agreed that she will be temporarily removed, without prejudice, from her position as independent chair of the BSCB whilst enquiries are ongoing'. Ms McHale was unavailable for comment today.","Elaine McHale retired in 2012 in the wake of four serious case reviews .

But two weeks later the couple from Hackney, east London, were stunned to receive a phone call from a vet who said their 19-year-old feline Amigo had been discovered alive and well. Mr and Mrs Ross, both 73, immediately realised that they had cremated somebody else’s pet cat - which looked identical to their own white, black and tan Maine Coon. He's back: Margaret and John Ross with their 19-year-old cat Amigo - who they thought they had cremated . Found: The couple received a phone call from a vet in London to say their cat of 15 years was safe and well . Retired barrister Mr Ross said: ‘It was exactly the same cat as ours, same colour, same everything. It had been badly injured and was definitely dead. We picked him up and took him home. ‘We said “this is our cat, he has been killed, can we have him cremated?” We didn’t check the microchip. We thought there was no point checking the chip of our dead cat.’ The couple, married for 52 years, asked a vet to send the cat to the Cambridge Pet Crematorium in Thriplow Heath, Hertfordshire, on January 17 - which was 12 days after he vanished. But last Tuesday - two weeks after paying £130 for the cremation - they received a phone call from the Wanstead Veterinary Hospital in east London to say their cat of 15 years was safe and well. Presumption: Mrs Ross said the couple 'never suspected' the dead animal 'might be somebody else's cat' Missing feline: Mr Ross said the dead cat was 'exactly' the same as Amigo - 'same colour, same everything' Mr Ross said: ‘Three weeks later we got a call from the veterinary hospital to say they found Amigo but I said “we’ve cremated him, it can’t be”. We shot off to the hospital and there was Amigo. ‘We said “Is he completely deaf? Has he got cysts on his back?” The vet said “yes”, and we knew he was our Amigo. We couldn’t believe we got him back. 'But then it struck, we’d cremated the wrong cat. We rung the crematorium and said if somebody wants the ashes of that cat then please give them the ashes.’ Mrs Ross, a retired English lecturer, added: ‘We never suspected it might be somebody else’s cat - if it had been an ordinary moggy then maybe, but Maine Coons are really quite rare. It had been a messy accident but it had the same white paws and white fluff as ours.’ A crematorium spokesman said the ashes of the unidentified cat would be scattered in its gardens.","John and Margaret Ross  found what they thought was their missing cat .

On the eve of the first leg three weeks ago Blanc spoke of Jose Mourinho being the arch provocateur and called for his players to keep their composure. Now the PSG coach has warned of striker Diego Costa's combative nature and the need for his side to balance risk-taking with being difficult to beat in a tie finely poised at 1-1. PSG star  Zlatan Ibrahimovic plays a first-time pass as he prepares to take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . David Luiz (second left) returns to his former home turf in a bid to end Chelsea's Champions League run . PSG players are put through their paces on Tuesday night ahead of Wednesday night's second leg match . Ibrahimovic will lead the line for PSG while Luiz is keen to show Chelsea they were wrong to discard him . 'He likes contact, and provokes opposition players. That's part of his game. He thrives off that,' Blanc said of Costa. 'He really needs that to bring out the best in his performances. 'The most important thing is to not get caught up in the way he plays. 'He will try to provoke a reaction. We need to stay calm, not get caught up in his game. We need to be as effective as possible in stopping him. 'It's up to us to try to take some risks, but not lose our heads and take unnecessary risks. 'Paris Saint-Germain need to stand up and be counted. We also need to stay in the game. That's the difficulty. Yes, we need to attack, yes, we need to create chances, but we also need to stay solid.' Luiz looks to the heavens as he takes to the pitch for training on the eve of their must-win encounter . Laurent Blanc addresses his players, including (from left) Thiago Silva, Luiz and Ibrahimovic . Blanc gestures to make a point to his players on Tuesday at Stamford Bridge . The Frenchmen, eliminated on away goals at Stamford Bridge last term when they let a 3-1 first-leg advantage slip, must score to advance to the quarter-finals for a third straight season. Blanc avoided talk of revenge after Demba Ba's heroics last term - the striker's last-gasp goal earned Chelsea progress to the semi-finals - and called for his side to take their chances. The PSG boss said: 'Chelsea have a slight advantage, because they were able to score an away goal. It's up to us to try to do what Chelsea did in Paris. 'One of Chelsea's main threats is the fact they're very good on the counter attack, so I don't think we should go gung ho. 'We have to attack and we need to score a goal, regardless of whether Chelsea get one or not. Although injuries have hampered Ibrahimovic's involvement, Blanc is sure he will have an impact . Brazilian defender Silva sports a black eye after contact with Dimitar Berbatov last week . 'I hope we do better than Chelsea did in the first leg. Chelsea created only one chance and they scored from that. I hope we create more than one chance.' Blanc hopes Thibaut Courtois is busy, but beaten, in Chelsea's goal. Blanc added: 'Their goalkeeper's performance was what allowed them to start as slight favourites going into the second leg. Over the 90 minutes PSG played better than Chelsea. 'If we create chances tomorrow night and he plays very well again that will prove that PSG have once again been better than Chelsea. 'He was very good in the first leg and I hope he's not as good tomorrow night.' Luiz plays with a ball as his team-mates look on with stern glares as they prepare for Wednesday night . PSG traverse the Bridge turf under lights ahead of their bid for a Champions League quarter-final place . For all the millions they have spent - including paying £50m to Chelsea for David Luiz - PSG are still to break into Europe's elite. Blanc believes it will take time. 'It's very easy to talk about, it's less easy to go out and do it,' Blanc said. 'In order to progress as a club you need experience. Paris Saint-Germain have got a little bit more experience, but we're still a long way off having the same levels of experience as Chelsea. 'Chelsea took a long while to become one of the best sides in Europe. They also invested a lot of money to get there. 'We need to be patient. 'In order to become one of the top four or top six sides in Europe it does take time. We've started that process.' Diego Costa (left with Ramires) will try to get under the skin of PSG's players, says Blanc . One notable difference this season over last is that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is available to Blanc. The Sweden striker was injured last term, but will come up against Chelsea captain John Terry and either Gary Cahill or Kurt Zouma. 'I don't think those two players (Cahill and Zouma) are going to be happy about facing Zlatan,' Blanc said. 'He's someone who loves the big occasion. He's a player who can score at any time, in any venue, against any opponent. 'I hope he shows that tomorrow night.'","Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea meet on Wednesday at Stamford Bridge .

Ibrahim Taguri told an undercover reporter posing as a wealthy Indian businessman that he would be able to channel money via family members and backdate cheques to avoid appearing on public registers. He was also said to have promised big donations could ‘open doors’ and introduced the fake donor to key figures including Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured, faces questions over his party's attempts to bypass donation limits . Mr Alexander was recorded at a dinner thanking the supposed businessman for what he was doing, adding: ‘I won’t intrude on the details, but genuinely it will make a difference.’ All donations of £7,500 or more are supposed to be publically registered. Last night Sir Alastair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said Mr Clegg’s high-minded rhetoric on sleaze was not matched by his party’s actions. ‘The leader of the party has always taken a stand on high standards in politics,’ he said. ‘There’s a conflict between what he says, and what his party is doing. ‘Any attempt to breach legal rules around party donations is a very serious matter. It is most unfortunate that the Lib Dems seem to be encouraging people to get round the legal provisions of party funding rules. You’d expect higher standards and better leadership.’ Last night it emerged that the Lib Dems had agreed to hand back Mr Taguri’s Commons pass after accepting he should not have had one as it raised the prospect of him using the Parliamentary estate for fundraising purposes. Sir Alastair said: ‘It is against the rules to carry out party political campaigning in the Commons, so allowing him to have a pass could be in breach of the rules. You’d class fundraising as party political campaigning.’ Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, pictured, thanked the undercover reporter who posed as a wealthy Indian businessman who was seeking to pump money into the Lib Dems for the election campaign . Lord Ashdown, the party’s election campaign leader, admitted that Mr Taguri – who yesterday quit as the Lib Dems’ general election candidate in Brent Central and is now likely to stand as an independent – had ‘serious questions to answer’. Mr Clegg told LBC Radio that Mr Alexander had done nothing wrong, save being polite to someone to whom he was introduced. The Deputy Prime Minister said the recording showed ‘Danny being a polite guy, just saying thank you to someone who he has been told is supporting the party’. ‘The idea that Danny or any parliamentarian has done anything wrong is categorically untrue,’ he said. ‘On the issue of Ibrahim Taguri, no cheque has been received by the Liberal Democrats, no cheque has been cashed. If we had received this cheque in question, of course it would have been scrutinised and checked.’ Mr Taguri, who has also stepped down as the Lib Dem race equality champion, denied any wrongdoing and said he was ‘confident that I will be exonerated of all the claims made against me’. He intends to fight the election as an independent but said he hoped to return to the party fold after clearing his name. The undercover reporter was apparently able to secure meetings with senior figures including Mr Alexander after giving several thousand pounds and promising far more. He was introduced to figures such as Lord Ashdown, taken to Mr Clegg’s office and attended a dinner for major party benefactors where he met Mr Alexander, the newspaper said. The fake donor is alleged to have been told by Mr Taguri that he could channel a donation via a ‘cousin’ after explaining that he wanted to remain ‘discreet’ about his financial support. He went on to hand over a cheque for more than the £7,500 threshold beyond which donations must be publicly registered with the Electoral Commission. Commission guidance, issued in 2007 in the wake of a scandal of ‘proxy’ donations to Labour, says giving money via a third party ‘must not be used as an attempt to evade the controls on permissibility and transparency’. Backdating a cheque could have allowed the donor to split the gift into smaller amounts of less than £7,500 – thus allowing him to evade declaring his name. A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: ‘We are aware of what’s been reported and are establishing the facts before determining what further steps to take.’","Senior Lib Dems were filmed talking about bypassing party finance laws .

Extremism experts warn children are being indoctrinated and radicalised from birth, leading to a 'whole generation who will know nothing other than ISIS ideology'. Their comments follow the release of a sickening new video that purports to show a boy of about 10 years old shooting dead of a 19-year-old Israeli-Arab who was taken hostage by the terror group. Scroll down for video . Training: Video footage released by the terrorist organisation shows children carrying guns during a training session . Armed: The children learn to fire AK-47s under the guidance of Islamic State militants in an unnamed training school . Young jihadi: It seems there is no age limit to attend an Islamic State school where children are 'brainwashed' Footage purports to show the child raise his gun and aim it at Muhammad Said Ismail Musallam's forehead before shooting him at point blank range . Vile: A new video appears to show a boy of about 10 years old shoot an Islamic State hostage in the head . The footage appears to show the child, now believed to be a French citizen, raise his gun and aim it at  Muhammad Said Ismail Musallam's forehead before shooting him at point blank range. The hostage seems to be shot a further three times on the ground before the boy lifts his gun to the sky in celebration, shouting  'Allahu Akbar!' and appearing to fire one final shot. The footage of a child seemingly carrying out such a brutal execution has sent shock waves around the world, but it came as no surprise to experts who have been following the brainwashing of youngsters by ISIS. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, said: ‘It is something that has been going on for a long time now. 'It’s deeply, deeply worrying because these children are growing up without any outside influence. ‘They are kids that are being indoctrinated and radicalised from birth.' He added: ‘This is going to be a long-term problem – there is going to be a whole generation of kids in Northern Iraq and Eastern Syria who will know nothing other than Islamic State ideology. ‘I don’t think there is a choice in it for the children – they are the biggest victims in all of this.’ ‘I don’t think there is a choice in it for the children – they are the biggest victims in all of this,' said an expert . Indoctrinated: These children are learning to become Islamic State militants at a school run by the terror group . Combat training: Videos released by the group reveal the tough military training children are forced to undergo and the warped curriculum they learn in terrorist-run schools . Two boys wrestle on the floor at an Islamic State training school, where they are also taught to fire AK-47s . ISIS video claiming to show a young boy executing two Russian spies - Mamayev Jambulat Yesenajovich and Ashimov Sergey Nikolayavich . But how does ISIS turn these innocent children into bloodthirsty killers, and how is it able to so effectively? Videos released by the group reveal the tough military training children are forced to undergo and the warped curriculum they learn in terrorist-run schools. Last month, ISIS released a slickly-edited propaganda video showing boys as young as five being indoctrinated at a military-style training camp for 'cubs' in Syria. Children are said to be taught how to use weapons and even show how to behead using dolls. 'They teach them how to use AK-47s,' an Iraqi security official told NBC News. 'They use dolls to teach them how to behead people, then they make them watch a beheading, and sometimes they force them to carry the heads in order to cast the fear away from their hearts.' Other footage shows children being taught in an ISIS school before learning hand-to-hand combat and how to fire a gun. Pictures posted on ISIS-linked social media accounts have included babies posing with firearms and young children holding up the heads of beheading victims. Some propaganda videos attempt to show the 'lighter' side of life under the control of the caliphate, and unsophisticated ploys such as giving sweets to children seem to have played a part in the radicalisation. ISIS-branded clothing has been made for children and even newborn babies. In a nine-minute video, children in camouflage are seen being trained at the Farouk Institute for Cubs, in the Raqqa province in Syria . 'Teacher': In footage released by ISIS, this man teaches a group of children to write Arabic in a classroom . Unsophisticated ploys such as giving sweets to children seem to have played a part in the radicalisation . Islamic State hands out sweets to children in Benghazi, Libya - another ploy to attract even younger recruits . Human Rights Watch, an organisation which defends the rights of people worldwide, interviewed four former  ISIS child and adult fighters, as well as civilians in the terrorist-controlled areas in Syria. It found the militants have actively recruited children to send to military training camps and have used them in operations including suicide bombings. Barbaric: A child holds a severed head in a photograph too gruesome to show . The children, including Bassim, 17, who joined at just 16 after attending ISIS sermons, said they were recruited through public forums. Raed, 17, went to a training camp when he was just 16, after ISIS visited his hometown in Syria. 'I liked what they are wearing, they were like one herd,' he said. 'They had a lot of weapons. So I spoke to them, and decided to go their training camp in Kafr Hamra in Aleppo.' These children and the adults interviewed said there were youngsters aged 13 or younger undergoing the same training and performing the same military duties as adults. Amr, 17, told Human Rights Watch that when he joined the jihadi movement full-time, he was given weapons and equipment, as well as a salary. He even signed up for suicide missions because he felt social pressure to do so, although he was towards the end of the list, several hundred names down. One doctor said he treated a boy aged between 10 and 12 years old whose job it was to whip ISIS prisoners. In November last year, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Syria report found that massacres, the beheading of boys as young as 15, and amputations and lashings in public squares with residents - including children - forced to watch were on the list of crimes.

The research, based on interviews and documents, photographs and video footage released by the group itself, showed there was widespread use of child soldiers, and forcing women to bear children to the fighters. It also discovered children are subjected to violence and are systematically recruited as soldiers - forced to witness and carry out atrocities. The report found ISIS was  trying to indoctrinate minority children and turn them against their families. Speaking to MailOnline, Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said he wouldn't be surprised if  hundreds of children had been recruited. ‘This is about the brainwashing and sexual grooming of our young children,' he said. 'It's very different from what happens when 18+ year olds become radicalised and are recruited into becoming jihadists. They are grown-ups and responsible for what they do. ‘They have been preyed upon by sadistic fanatics.' Speaking to MailOnline, Professor Anthony Glees, director of the Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said children have been 'preyed upon by sadistic fanatics' An ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like under the Islamic State caliphate at a fairground north of Mosul in Iraq . He added: 'The prime responsibility for this lies with the radicalisers and recruiters and the internet service providers who provide the links that they follow with such dedication that they turn their backs on their loved ones and the good things that all children should have, whatever their faith or ethnic background. ‘Instead, they have been delivered to those who peddle exploitation and death. We here now have some very tough questions to address. ‘Our laws make it plain that we owe a very clear duty of care to the children. They are kids.’ Just yesterday, it was reported a 13-year-old from France had died fighting for Islamic State in Syria. It's been reported that Abu Bakr al-Faransi, originally from Strasbourg, was killed when Government forces attacked a border post he was guarding. It is believed to be the youngest to die fighting for Islamic State in Syria. And last month, it was revealed ISIS had released a guidebook to help young mothers raise a 'Mujahid child'. 'Don't wait until they are seven to start, for it may be too late by then,' it says. Human Rights Watch has called on ISIS to stop deliberately recruiting children, in particular through weapons training and other military training in school environments.

Dave Scott and Sarah Oliver, Paula and Stephen Black, Liam and Victoria Barrett, and Lee Hodgson and Leanne Westlake are battling it out to become crowned the UK's most mismatched couple in a competition held by Newcastle's Metro Radio. The finalists beat hundreds of entrants to make it to the top four, and the winners of the tongue-in-cheek competition will win a luxury seven night holiday in a five-star resort in Corfu. Dave Scott, 22, and Sarah Oliver, 24, from Sunderland, have beaten hundreds of entrants to become finalists of the UK's 'Punching Above Your Weight' competition . Originally there were five finalists, but one couple were disqualified from the competition after producers discovered that Andrea Burlington, 36, of South Shields, had entered her deceased husband. Andrea explained that her husband Andrew Bedlington had sadly passed away in October 2013, but she still wanted to enter in tribute to her late husband as a way of keeping his memory alive: 'I felt like I was doing something with him again,' she says,'it was wonderful.' Andrea Burlington, 36, of South Shields, above, entered her husband Andrew in the competition as a way of keeping his memory alive . Andrew, who had two children with Andrea, sadly passed away in 2013 . 'It was my daughter who suggested I enter the competition, and as the conditions said nothing about the entrants being alive, I thought why not! Andrea brought Andrew's ashes into the studios in the urn usually kept next to her bed. Surprised station bosses checked with their legal team and despite her being selected as a finalist, the rules stipulated that the holiday must be awarded to a winning couple, whereas Andrea wanted to take her and Andrew's two children, Shannon, 18, and Chloe, 11. The Metro Radio team decided to treat Andrea and her children to another holiday anyway and an emotional Andrea said: 'I couldn't believe it. Andrew was the breadwinner and I was a stay at home mum, there would be no way I would have be able to take the kids anywhere in the foreseeable future.' Steve Furnell from the Steve & Karen Breakfast show who are holding the competition says: 'Andrea has been so fantastic. It's been an emotional roller coaster and we're so happy that we were able to give her and her girls the chance to go away too. Now it's time to get cracking with our final four couples who'll battle it out for the holiday prize.' MEET THE PUNCHING ABOVE YOUR WEIGHT FINALISTS . COUPLE A: DAVE SCOTT AND SARAH OLIVER .

Hairdresser Paula, 42, and mixed martial arts gym manager Stephen, 36, from Jarrow, County Durham, met on a blind date four years ago. The couple, who got married last September say friends have often joked that they are mismatched: . 'My sister Marie, who I work with in the salon, encouraged me to enter because she has heard Stephen's friends saying he was punching above his weight with me.' says Paula. 'I've heard it too - it is the standard joke. We'd love to win!' Paula, 42, and Stephen, 36, say that the fact he is 'punching' is a standard joke among friends .

England have  named a 16-man party for the three-Test series next month that  includes the Durham all-rounder who was left out of the disastrous World Cup campaign. Stokes emerged as the most exciting young talent in the English game when he scored a maiden Test century in the third Ashes Test in Perth but then endured a miserable year after breaking his wrist when punching a locker in frustration after being dismissed in Barbados. All-rounder Ben Stokes has been recalled for the England Test squad for the upcoming West Indies tour . All-rounder Stokes has remained in the thoughts of selectors and performed well for the England Lions in South Africa (above left) - he has been brought back amid fitness concerns over Chris Woakes . His all-round form was so bad that he was left out of the World Cup but England have now decided to bring him back into the fold with fitness concerns over Chris Woakes. Stokes' uncapped Durham team-mate Mark Wood also travels to St Kitts on April 2 as does Adam Lyth, Adil Rashid, Jonny Bairstow and Liam Plunkett in a squad that reflects Yorkshire’s status as the best county for producing talent. The four Yorkshire players join their more established county colleagues Joe Root and Gary Ballance. Jonathan Trott, captaining the Lions in January,  has been recalled by England for their  tour of West Indies . Yorkshire's contingent includes established Test batsman Joe Root, who endured a tough World Cup . Gary Ballance, here during a training session at the World Cup, is another product of the Yorkshire system . VIDEO We take responsibility for exit - Morgan . Wood, 25, is an exciting fast bowler whose progress has been restricted by injury but who has impressed outgoing England bowling coach David Saker and the man who may replace him Ottis Gibson. Lyth has also been rewarded for prolific county form, a more mature Rashid than the man who first toured with England six years ago will travel as all-round spin-bowling back-up and Bairstow pips Kent’s exciting young talent Sam Billings as back-up wicketkeeper. Jonathan Trott, as first revealed in Sportsmail, returns for the first time since a mental condition later diagnosed as situational anxiety caused him to leave England’s ill-fated last Ashes tour after the first Test in Brisbane. Opener Adam Lyth (left) has been rewarded for his prolific county form and Adil Rashid is back in the fold. Lyth's teammate Richard Pyrah tweeted his congratulations, below .

Stokes' uncapped Durham team-mate Mark Wood also travels with the England squad to St Kitts on April 2 . Alastair Cook will return as captain for a three-Test tour that England desperately need to win after being embarrassingly eliminated from the first round of the World Cup. Ian Bell, wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, Stuart Broad, Chris Jordan and James Anderson all retain their spots from the team that beat India at the Kia Oval in August. Peter Moores looks sure to remain in his coaching job for now but cannot afford any slip ups against what will be a West Indies side weakened by the Indian Premier League.

Within their 'cool range', the clothing company uses fabrics with CoolFresh technology woven through the seams, which is designed to work with your body temperature and keep you cool in the warm months. The designer's say the technology used in their dresses helps minimise clamminess with breathable fibres and wicks away moisture much quicker than wool or cotton. The larger surface area of the fibres in their dresses apparently allows for faster evaporation by speeding moisture away from the skin to the surface of the fabric where it can evaporate quickly. Dresses from the 'warm collection' are made with fabrics that claim to keep you twice as warm as wool or cotton using material inspired by polar bear fur .

The range of gowns is priced between £35 - £155 and on sale on the brand's website, as well as in-store at House Of Fraser and Debenhams . The brand also say that all dresses, which come in luxe pastels, lace and emblazoned with English floral prints, are anti-odour and easy to wash.

United were dumped out of the FA Cup by Arsenal on Monday and face a battle to finish in the top four with a difficult run of fixtures over the next six weeks. And former United midfielder Scholes, who has two season tickets at his old club, is unconvinced that Van Gaal's preferred style of play suits the players in his squad. Louis van Gaal gives instructions to Ashley Young during Manchester United's defeat by Arsenal . Marouane Fellaini, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney (L-R) look dejected at Old Trafford . Arsene Wenger was right! I would have loved to have played with Mesut Ozil... but only if he always performed like he did at Old Trafford . Writing in his column for The Independent, Scholes said: 'Watching United at Old Trafford on Monday, I know what Louis van Gaal is trying to do with this team. I do like the concept. I just question whether he has the players to do it. 'In recent weeks, Van Gaal has tried what I would describe as a more Barcelona-style approach to games. His centre backs push wide, the full backs push on and the team pass the ball. It has worked against the weaker teams but it is against the stronger sides, starting with Spurs and the high-pressing game they play, that you have to wonder whether it will be found out. 'To play this way, you really need to be exceptional. Barcelona can do it because they have the players and they have been playing this way for years. United have spent around £220m in the last three transfer windows and yet I would question whether they have the players to operate this system.' Van Gaal has been criticised for utilising Fellaini's height and physical presence at times this season . Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes believes the club must buy more new players this summer . United were known for their relentless attacking under Sir Alex Ferguson and Scholes, who was an integral part of the Scot's midfield, wants to see fluid football back at Old Trafford. 'I understand what Van Gaal is trying to do,' Scholes wrote. 'I like that he is playing with the wide players. I also know that as former players we cannot harp on about the old days for ever. Things change, although I believe that certain principles, of attacking, entertaining football, should always be protected. 'Like any other match-going fan – I have two season tickets for Old Trafford – I want to see the team play well and win. I just don’t think this system is the best for these players.' Angel di Maria has struggled to adapt since joining the club in a £60million deal from Real Madrid . Former Chelsea midfielder Juan Mata has found himself out of favour under Van Gaal in recent months . Van Gaal's men are fourth in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday's clash with Tottenham but they could drop out of the Champions League places if they suffer defeat and rivals Liverpool win at Swansea on Monday night. Despite the club's precarious position, Scholes is adamant that the Dutchman has what it takes to turn things around - even if he must take action in the summer transfer window. He added: 'I still believe that Van Gaal is the right man for the job. I don’t think he will change his mind about the way he wants the team to play. He is a stubborn man and that is no bad thing in football. But I am afraid to say that if he wants to play this Barcelona style then the club will have to go back into the transfer market this summer to get the players they need to do it.'","Paul Scholes believes Louis van Gaal is trying to play a 'Barcelona style'

But that was when Jose Ignacio Peleteiro Ramallo — or Jota for short — announced himself to English football and gave Brentford fans a first inkling that they could end a 68-year wait to return to the top flight of English football. Now, after a mid-season stumble following the bizarre news that their manager Mark Warburton was going to be replaced at the end of the season regardless of whether the club earn promotion, they are entertaining realistic hopes of becoming one of the smallest clubs to have graced the Premier League. Brentford playmaker Jota has been one of the club's standout players this season as they fight for promotion . The Spaniard joined Brentford from Celta Vigo last summer and has impressed in England's second tier . Jota dribbles with the ball ahead of  Watford's Ikechi Anya (right) during the match at Griffin Park in February . Brentford manager Mark Warburton will leave the club at the end of this season regardless of how they finish . The winter’s night was last November when Jota left fly a stoppage-time winner over arch rivals Fulham. It was their first League meeting for 18 years and made sure Brentford’s neighbours knew there was a change of the guard in west London. Quite something for a 23-year-old who struggled at Celta Vigo and then with Real Madrid’s reserves. ‘That derby was intense, a special moment for me. It felt I’d really arrived at Brentford that night,’ said Jota, who will face Fulham again at Craven Cottage on Friday. ‘As soon as I came here everybody was telling me about Fulham. After the goal everybody was stopping me in the street saying, “You’re a hero, thank you, thank you!” People work all week and we want to put a smile on their faces.’ Jota is relishing the competition in the Championship and hopes to help Brentford return to the top-flight . Jota strikes the ball at Brentford's training complex during his interview with MailSport . Speaking in Spanish, Jota sits inside a hut at their modest training complex with seven games — or possibly more in the play-offs — to achieve what appeared unobtainable. He was relaxed, at ease with the club’s situation despite the upheaval in their management structure and laughed in agreement at the notion that no team appear to want to take charge of the promotion race, such is the absurdly close top eight. Just one point separated the top five a fortnight ago. Jota was open on the serious problems they encountered after February’s shocking developments regarding Warburton’s future. The popular boss will leave at the end of the season to be replaced by a foreign coach who buys into owner Matthew Benham’s continental philosophy and Jota admitted the news seriously affected the squad. ‘For a week or so we dropped our levels,’ he said. ‘You hear rumours… you don’t know what’s going to happen. It was a short period of confusion but we’re now focused. ‘We’re all still united but it’s never the best thing for something like that to happen in the middle of the season.’ Jota celebrates scoring the winning goal for Brentford against rivals Fulham at at Griffin Park in November . They have levelled just in time and are one point off the play-offs. Brentford have an ace up their sleeve, too. It was Jota’s winner against Alaves to seal tiny Eibar’s rise to La Liga this time last year. He wants to do it again but in front of 90,000 at Wembley. ‘Everyone has told me about this final at Wembley,’ he added. ‘Achieve that in front of these supporters who have been so good to me? It’d be amazing. This would be truly historic, just as it was for Eibar. But we won the league there so this would be more dramatic.’ The similarities between Brentford and Eibar are stark. Both have populations of 27,000 and while Brentford have not seen the top flight since 1947, Eibar embarked on their first premier campaign in August. Using his best English, Jota is trying to draw on last year’s experience and explain it to others in the squad. Learning the language has not come naturally but assimilating to our game has. ‘There’s probably more space here than in Spain,’ he said. ‘There’s plenty of opportunity to construct attacks here, create chances. That’s the way we want to play at Brentford. Being able to play in a similar way to back home has helped me integrate into the game over here. We’re given time on the ball, told to express ourselves. We play some of the best football in the Championship. ‘There are a lot of teams who are trying to play a more beautiful style of play. I’ve been most impressed by Derby County. Jota believes that the Championship is 'among the best five leagues in Europe' and has praised its intensity . ‘Everything is massively competitive. It comes down to the mentality of the clubs here. They’re all big stadiums, famous clubs. They want to get to that next level. It’s probably more intense than I was expecting. Everybody has expensive players, too.’ Jota did not come cheap, costing progressive Brentford £1.5 million in the summer, and has been watched by Premier League clubs. The top flight is where he wants to be and his girlfriend is in the process of moving over to London. ‘England is famous for having the best league in the world and the Championship is also a brilliant division,’ he said. ‘It’s more intense, physical. I’ve watched all this from afar and knew what I was getting myself into. ‘This has great clubs with top facilities — everyone has one goal. The Championship is among the best five leagues in Europe.’ Brentford shelled out £1.5 million to sign Jota from La Liga club Celta Vigo last summer .","Spanish playmaker Jota has been one of the stars of Brentford's surprise push for promotion to the Premier League this season .

A mother who left her 16-month-old daughter alone in a hotel room while she went for a night out with a friend has been given a police caution for neglect. The Mexican woman left the Ibis hotel at around 7.30pm when she went to meet a friend and left her child alone until she returned at about 2.30am with a man, the family division of the High Court in London heard. Staff heard the little girl, realised that she was alone and called police. The woman was arrested when she returned to the Ibis, and accepted a caution by police. Her daughter was taken into police protection. Details of the case were revealed as a judge made a ruling on a family court dispute between the parents of the young girl. Mr Justice Peter Jackson was told that the woman had become involved in a legal fight with the little girl's English father - her estranged husband - who was also in his early 30s. He said he had been asked to make decisions on the latest stage of that litigation at a family court hearing. The judge said the woman and the child, now two, had been in England visiting the man at the time of the hotel incident last year. He did not say where the hotel was. Mr Justice Jackson said the little girl had been taken into police protection following her mother's arrest - and placed with her father. A judge had subsequently barred the woman from removing the child from the jurisdiction of England and Wales following an application by the father, Mr Justice Jackson was told. Mr Justice Jackson said he had become involved after the woman asked to be allowed to take the little girl back to Mexico. The family division of the High Court heard details of the neglect as a judge refused an application by the girl's mother, who is from Mexico, to take her back to the country. She is currently living with her father . He ruled against her after analysing issues relating to the toddler's 'habitual residence'. The judge concluded that the little girl had not been wrongfully retained in England by the father under the terms of an international legal convention. He was told that the couple had met in Mexico six years ago after the father travelled abroad for work.

The grandmother, from St Davids, west Wales, had flown to  America for an 'extended trip' and had recently been to meet up with fans at the singer's former home of Graceland. Grandmother Andrea Ahmed (pictured with an Elvis impersonator) died in a hit-and-run moments after watching a tribute act perform in Memphis on her 54th birthday . An inquest heard she went to see her favourite impersonator Joe Kent in May last year, who she had seen perform 'dozens of times over the years'. He had sung a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' to Ms Ahmed, a divorced mother-of-one, and then serenaded her with her favourite song 'Yesterday, When I was Young'. Later, Ms Ahmed, who was staying at the Airport Inn in Memphis, was crossing East Brooks Road when she was knocked down and killed by a driver, who then sped off.

'She evidently went back in the hotel and got on their computer in the lobby. 'Then she must have gone back outside. That's when it happened. She was killed by a hit and run driver. 'It's just so sad - I am just crushed.' Pembrokeshire coroner Mark Layton told the family that very little information, other than that Mrs Ahmed has been struck by a motor vehicle, was available. The court heard US authorities failed to trace the driver has never been traced by authorities in America and a 'lack of information' had slowed down the investigation into the details of Ms Ahmed's death. Matthew Francis, her daughter's partner, told the inquest they knew 'very little' of what happened - because there were no witnesses nor CCTV. He said: 'From what we know she had gone out there to see the home of Elvis. It was Elvis week and she was going to meet friends. 'We know that she had a booking slip for a bus to Orlando, which was due to leave not far from the time she was struck. 'We do not know if she was going back to the hotel or going for the bus.'

The Lib Dem leader was challenged over his call for drug users not to be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances. He said it was ‘ridiculous’ that young people’s future careers could be ‘blighted’ by nothing more than a ‘teenage indiscretion’. Nick Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record . The Liberal Democrat manifesto will commit the party to ending imprisonment for possession of drugs for personal use and ensure that those arrested with small amounts of illicit substances do not get a criminal record. But during his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg was grilled about how many cannabis joints a teenager could be caught with without getting a criminal record. LBC host Nick Ferrari said: ‘I’m an 18-year-old student, I get stopped by police, I have 20 joints in the boot of my car. I subsequently want to become a teacher. Can I become a teacher?’ Mr Clegg insisted that as the law stands that person would not be able to become a teacher. But he said the law needed to be changed: ‘I think it’s completely wrong if some teenager, 17 or 18 year old, dabbles in… I don’t know whether it’s 20 [joints] or one. ‘Do I think their chances of working as a nurse, as a teacher, or a lawyer or a taxi driver should be blighted forever, of course I don’t. ‘If you are a teenager, one in five youngster use drugs, a third of adults have used drugs at some point in their life in this country. ‘What you are saying to me is someone who as a 17 or 18--year-old and has smoked some hassish, and they are caught doing that, you’re saying they should never ever… work as a nurse, as a teacher.’ Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clergg shared a platform with Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson to argue said drug users should not be given criminal records for possessing illegal substances . Yesterday's announcement follows a controversial ‘research’ project ordered by Lib Dem Home Office ministers, which used taxpayers’ money to study drugs policy around the world. Jeremy Browne and Norman Baker jetted off to examine how other countries tackle drugs. They travelled to ten countries, including the US, Portugal and Sweden, at a cost of almost £40,000. The Lib Dems seized on parts of the report suggesting decriminalisation in countries like Portugal cut the health damage caused by drugs. But critics said they ignored evidence that the number of children using drugs had risen. Pressed again on the scenario of 20 joints, Mr Clegg hit back: ‘If he has got 20 joints is he allowed to be a teacher. ‘Your fixation is whether it was 20. My fixation is whether do I think they should be ruled out forever to work as a teacher. ‘I think it’s ridiculous that we turn what might be a teenage indiscretion into a lifelong ban from public service in our schools and hospitals. ‘I think that is one of the many, many features of our approach to the so-called war on drugs which is irrational, and counter-productive.’ Mr Clegg yesterday shared a platform with Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson  who claimed that smoking powerful cannabis does not cause ‘any harm’. The Virgin tycoon shared a platform with the Lib Dem leader to promote the party’s pledge. He said: ‘Of people taking hash [cannabis], something like 99 per cent do not have a problem ... Take people taking skunk. ‘It’s slightly worse than alcohol. But there are a lot of people doing it for recreational purposes and they enjoy doing it and it’s not doing them any harm.’ However, he today sought to clarify his remarks, insisting he was talking about 'hash' and not 'skunk'. Sir Richard said in a blog: 'What I did say was that many people take hash for recreational purposes and enjoy it without doing themselves any harm. 'The same way that drinking alcohol, if you do it in moderation, is not going to do people any harm.' A study last month by Kings College London found that 24 per cent of new cases of psychosis are linked to the use of skunk. The report concluded that smoking skunk trebles the risk of someone having a psychotic episode. Last night, Mr Clegg also insisted that the so-called ‘war on drugs’ was ‘not working’, although he was later forced to concede that official figures show drug use has been falling in Britain for years. The Home Secretary Theresa May has blocked any softening of the drugs laws. The Lib Dems want to take drug policy away from the Home Office and place it in the Department of Health . A poll of 100 charities by the Centre for Social Justice last night found that 69 per cent of charities in the field would be concerned if the Government decriminalised cannabis. More than half (56 per cent) said cannabis use would increase if its use was decriminalised. Andy Cook, chief executive of charity Twenty Twenty, which works with disadvantaged young-people, said: ‘We are scared by the idea of liberalising cannabis laws. We work tirelessly to get the most disadvantaged and disengaged young people back into learning and to hold down jobs. If they are taking cannabis it makes it almost impossible to succeed – sapping their motivation and effectively tying our hands in the support we can give. ‘Cannabis is ruining the life opportunities of those we work with, so the idea that society would be better off if this stuff was decriminalised is crazy. Making it more easily available and more culturally acceptable will mean that more of our young people would take it. The result will be that more of our young people would fail to make the most of their potential.’","Nick Clegg said users should not be given criminal records for possession .
He said decriminalisation would apply to 'harder' drugs such as heroin .

So luckily for this father, a pair of raccoons took it upon themselves to make his job a little easier by giving a little demonstration in the garden. The hilarious footage captured in Seattle begins innocently enough with some excited children looking out of the window at two raccoons scaling their fence. The children watch on excitedly as the male raccoon chases the female from the fence and into the garden . As the youngsters speculate about whether they will jump from the fence – before a little ‘muffin man’ song interlude – one of the raccoons descends into the garden closely pursued by the other. One child, sensing the tension, asks: ‘Can raccoons fight?’ While another exclaims: ‘Woah, they’re wrestling.’ As one raccoon mates the other, the children begin to laugh and the father responds quickly be saying: ‘They’re doing more than wrestling I think.’ Laughing along in the excitement, the father continues to film the episode in the garden until one of the children offers up an explanation in the form of a question: ‘Is he doing the Heimlich manoeuvre?’ The children laugh hysterically as the two raccoons begin mating and offer up a number of innocent explanations for their behaviour . ‘I think so,’ replies one of the children before the father confidently states: ‘Yes, that’s the Heimlich.’ Raccoons usually mate between late January and mid-March, in a period triggered by increasing daylight. During the mating season, males spend much of their time searching for females in an attempt to copulate in the three-to-four day period when conception is possible. The encounters can last over and hour and may be repeated over several nights, so it is likely that the children have some laughs still yet to come. The Heimlich manoeuvre?

Sutter Home, Korbel, Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, also known as 'Two-Buck Chuck,' were just a few of the 31 wine brands the lawsuit claimed were unsafe. Twenty-eight California wineries were listed in the complaint, which is asking for a halt in production of the wines in question. Scroll down for video . A new lawsuit claims dozens of cheap and popular California Wine, including Franzia and Trader Joe's Charles Shaw White Zifandel, are tainted with dangerously high levels of arsenic . The lawsuit was filed by four individual Southern California wine consumers who, according to their attorney Brian Kabateck, had 1,306 wines tested at a Denver-based laboratory and then confirmed results with two additional laboratories. Kabateck said 83 wines, almost all of which sell for below $10 a bottle, contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water. The Environmental Protection Agency standard for drinking water is 10 parts per billion - meaning that the tests allegedly found arsenic levels that were double the federal drinking water standard. 'This is a very serious public health concern,' Kabateck said. 'We would hope the wine industry would take these wines off the shelf immediately.' 'If not voluntarily, we would ask the court to do it.' The United States does not have a set standard for safe levels of arsenic in wine, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The lawsuit claims 83 of the 1,306 wines that were tested contained arsenic levels 10 parts per billion above the range considered safe for drinking water . But wines are allowed to have arsenic levels up to 100 parts per billion in Canada - and other countries allow even higher levels. The Wine Institute, an advocacy group for California wineries, called the lawsuit 'misleading' and 'false'. According to Institute spokeswoman Gladys Horiuchi, California wines have never come close to exceeding the arsenic levels that are accepted in other countries, she told the Associated Press. In a release statement, the Institute said arsenic was 'prevalent in the natural environment' and that 'no research' had found the amounts in wine to 'pose a health risk to consumers'. The lawsuit specifies the wines contained 'inorganic arsenic,' which is more toxic than the arsenic found naturally in the environment. Chronic long-term consumption of inorganic arsenic can cause cancer, as well as liver and kidney damage. But a number of wine producers have fought back at the lawsuit and said they plan to contest the claims. A Trader Joe's spokesman said the grocery store chain had 'no reason to believe the wines we offer are unsafe, including Charles Shaw White Zinfandel'. Korbel said the lawsuit was 'without merit,' adding that the company plans to challenge the allegations. The 83 bottles of wine cited in a lawsuit this week as having dangerously high levels of arsenic came from 28 California wineries and were bottled under 31 different brand labels. Some of the labels included several different types of wine.

The charge comes after it was revealed the senior figure in the Catholic Church did not report priest Jim Fletcher who was accused of paedophilia while they were working in the Maitland region, north of Sydney in New South Wales. Fletcher ended up serving prison time from 1989 to 1991 after he was convicted of raping a 13-year-old boy. Five years later, the convicted paedophile died. A Special Commission of Inquiry conducted last year handed down that Fletcher 'had an extensive history of perpetrating child sexual abuse in the diocese, exclusively abusing young males, particularly altar boys'.

NSW police said a 64-year-old man was charged after allegedly concealing 'a serious offence regarding child sexual abuse' in the Hunter region. The charge is the result of an investigation by Strike Force Lantle, which since 2010 has probed allegations of concealment of child abuse by former and current clergy attached to the Maitland-Newcastle Diocese of the Catholic Church.

Overweight children are the latest target for serial ranter Katie Hopkins. The controversial columnist has said that fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight. Writing in her column for Now! magazine, the 39-year-old said: 'The most upsetting thing of all is a fat child. 'Watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle.' The mother-of-three adds in her video blog for the magazine that she blames the parents for children with weight problems: 'I've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent. 'The fat kids go through the school gates and there's the fat mum in the car, who doesn't bother to get out, still wearing her pyjamas...and that really does my head in.' Citing government statistics that say one-in-10 four-year-olds are now overweight, the Celebrity Big Brother star even goes as far to say that, if she had her way, fat children would be 'sent to special sports schools until they make the grade.' Hopkins also opines that she thinks people in England are far too soft on 'fat shaming'. 'There's loads of fat kids and we don't say anything because that would be fat-shaming, or bullying...well, I disagree completely. 'In England, we're far too soft on it and we seem to think it's okay that people are pureeing KFC to spoon-feed to their babies.' Earlier this year, the opinionated former Apprentice star filmed herself gaining and losing four stone in an effort to prove that obesity is purely the fault of the person carrying the weight. Katie has form with insulting overweight people. On her television show Making My Fat, she was kicked out of an 800lb woman's house after rows. Now, she's turned her venom to children, saying obese kids should go to 'special sports schools' until they make the grade' Katie before her own weight gain (left) and after (right) In the programme, Katie was frequently seen bursting into floods of tears over her new body shape, but also over the amount of food that she has to eat every day to put on the weight. She loaded up on junk food every couple of hours, setting herself a target of 5,000 calories every day. Katie's doctor advised her not to go through with the programme, warning the star that she faced a number of health problems including liver strain, damaged knees, altered blood chemistry, and stretched skin among other issues. But she persisted with the experiment, going so far as to travel to North Carolina in the US to take part in an eating competition. Katie reveals she had to sleep next to a sick bucket  because overeating made her feel so nauseous . At the fast food restaurant, customers are given 20 minutes to consume a monster burger, containing a kilo of meat and 8,000 calories. Katie gave the meal her best shot, but only succeeded in consuming around half. She said: 'There are two kids in there who are around 15 or 16 years old and they must weigh between 200 pounds (14.2 stone) and 300 pounds (21 stone) each. 'I can't understand why no one is telling them to stop. 'I feel really sorry for those children. Their parents were just there watching them eat. 'I just want to go and ask them to stop. 'I couldn't do that to my children. I could never feed my children to death.' Katie also visited an American called Nicky, a woman who weighs 803lb (57 stone). Nicky is often confined to her house because of the weight that she carries around. While the women initially got on like a house on fire, Katie quickly insulted Nicky and the women became embroiled in an argument, which saw her asked to leave the house. The TV star was unrepentant, telling the cameras: 'There is no way she is really happy. 'She has managed to become happy with what she has got by accepting it's rubbish. 'I would rather be put down than be Nicky.' Making My Fat followed Katie Hopkins as she gained 4st on a mammoth diet of 6,500 calories a day, then lost the weight through a healthy eating plan and exercise . The end of the programme saw Katie engage in extreme eating to try and put on the weight, gorging on 400 calories every couple of hours. Katie Hopkins strikes fear into the hearts of many people in the UK - she recently came second in a poll of the world's most hated people. The television star's documentary made her so disliked among larger ladies and men that they actively try to avoid her. She told FEMAIL: 'Fat people can be quite afraid of me, there is this sort of Hopkins fear. 'A lot of them will actually cross the road to avoid me if they see me walking down the street. Katie said she wanted her TLC documentary to start a debate about the nation's obesity crisis . 'Others will present me with their excuses before I have even opened my mouth, which is weird because it's not like I go around judging me all of the time. 'Fat mums completely avoid me, but that’s fine.' Katie has had a bee in her bonnet about overweight men and women for a couple of years. Last year she made headlines around the world after she revealed that she wouldn't hire a fat person because they are 'lazy'. So in the last six months, the 39-year-old decided to put on 30 per cent of her body weight in just three months and then lose it just as quickly, to prove that larger people only have themselves to blame for piling on the pounds. The star has very little time for larger people, admitting than she can hardly bear to touch anyone carrying a little extra fat, but she has even less for their excuses. Instead of laying the blame for Britain's obesity problem at the door of the takeaway shops and junk food companies, Katie says it is the fault of the individual and they need to be aware that it is not okay to look as they do. Katie said: 'At my heaviest during this television experiment, I weighed 12 stone. 'Nowadays, I hear a lot of women say 12st isn’t that big - they say that because you can be 12 stone and a size 14. 'But it's strange idea that we think 12st isn’t that big, I actually find it very alarming. 'We keep pushing up the boundaries, first of all 10st wasn't that big, then 11st and now 12st. 'I really worry about the re-sizing that we have done as a nation. 'By putting size 16 models in Debenhams shop windows and embracing bigger seats, bigger beds and bigger geriatric ambulances - we are re-scaling what we perceive as normal.' The controversial figure claims that while she didn't shed a tear at her wedding or the birth of her children, gaining 3st pushing her weight over 11st  'killed her' and left her in constant floods . But while Katie thinks the plus-size models in Debenhams shop windows are unacceptable, the super-skinny mannequins that recently caused an uproar in Topshop are acceptable in her eyes. She said: 'I don’t mind skinny mannequins. 'I didn’t think that they were particularly skinny, I thought that they looked pretty alright. 'There are a lot of kids at that age who are relatively skinny. I was a pretty skinny kid. 'In terms of sizing, Mango starts their plus-size collection at a size 12 and I’ve always said that size 12 is a size called fat. 'Because for me, it’s not necessarily that a size 12 is fat, it’s so that people can have a sense of what is normal. 'I believe that we take our cues on what is normal from what we see on the high street and as we are getting bigger, we are just re-sizing or super-sizing what we think is normal.' In part two of Katie's documentary she debated diet bloggers and plus-size campaigners . Katie's approach to weight loss is five parts stick, zero parts carrot. Asked about a fat tax as a potential solution, making customers pay a heftier tax on junk food than healthy produce, Katie scoffs and suggests a far more radical option. She says: 'I’m not averse to the idea of a fat tax, but I would go much more brutal than that. 'I think the fact that we don’t own our problems in this country is the biggest issue that we have. 'For instance, our NHS in this country is free at point of use, but most people perceive that as completely free. 'Therefore, any problem that they create with their body is also free, with someone else footing the bill.' She continued: 'Obese people are bankrupting us - they cost us something like £17.4 billion last year. 'We need to make these people own the problem. So, we should have a social security insurance scheme, whereby people are charged if they don’t make a genuine effort to look after their own health. 'If you don’t look after your own health, guess what? You’re going to pay more. So if you smoke, guess what? You’re going to pay more. You drink too much, guess what? You’re going to pay more. 'And if you eat yourself into being morbidly obese, then you’re going to pay for your hip operation as well. 'That would make people own their problems better than some kind of fat tax. 'Because this tea and sympathy lark just isn't working.'","Controversial columnist says she finds 'fat children' upsetting .

Ollie, who led his team to the NCAA men's basketball championship last year, is abiding by a travel ban ordered by Connecticut's governor because of Indiana's new religious-objections law. Governor Dannel P. Malloy and other critics contend the law would allow businesses to deny service to gays and lesbians based on religious beliefs. Scroll down for video . Coach: UConn men's basketball coach Kevin Ollie (seen with players in January 2015) will not be traveling to the Final Four this week, the university announced Tuesday . Champions: UConn was the 2014 national champion and Ollie was to attend coaches meetings and other events surrounding this year's championship . The Democratic governor on Monday signed an executive order banning state spending on travel to Indiana. Malloy left the decision to travel to the Final Four up to Ollie and the university, which had already paid for much of his trip. 'That's a decision for them and UConn to make, um, what I'm saying is, let's not be silly here,' he was filmed telling reporters. 'There are gay men and gay women who participate in intercollegiate sports.' UConn was the 2014 national champion and Ollie was to attend coaches meetings and other events surrounding this year's championship. University President Susan Herbst issued a statement Tuesday evening in support of the governor's ban and said neither Ollie nor any other member of the basketball staff would travel to Indianapolis. 'In support of Governor Malloy's travel ban to the state of Indiana, Kevin Ollie and other members of the UConn men's basketball staff will not travel to Indianapolis for the NCAA Final Four and events surrounding it,' Herbst said. She continued 'UConn is a community that values all of our members and treats each person with the same degree of respect, regardless of their background and beliefs and we will not tolerate any other behavior.' Issues: Many, including Democratic Indiana State Rep. Ed DeLaney (pictured on Saturday), have protested the state's new law . Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (seen Tuesday) urged lawmakers Tuesday to send a bill to his desk by the end of the week to clarify the intent of the new law . NBC Connecticut reported Ollie and staff members would have gone to National Association of Basketball Coaches. The convention will be held in Indianapolis from April 2 to April 6. Warde Manuel, UConn's athletic director, told The Associated Press on Monday that he also finds the law unacceptable. Manuel said he hopes the state of Indiana rectifies the situation before UConn or any other institution considers a boycott of the 2016 women's Final Four, which also is being held in the city. 'They have a choice to make and I think others have choices to make on whether they'll spend money at the businesses in the state of Indiana,' he said. Ahead of the announcement, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) told NBC Connecticut 'I wouldn’t presume to give advice but if I were in their shoes I would stay away. I think they can send a very powerful message as all of us can.' The University of Southern California's Athletic Director Pat Haden also tweeted Tuesday 'I am the proud father of a gay son.

More than 60 of the beautiful creatures decided to make use of the resort's pool, taking turns to drink from it three at a time. Rangers and visitors at the resort were treated to a very up-close view of the wild animals as specialist guide Mark Lautenbach snapped these amazing pictures. Scroll down for video . Guests got more than they had paid for when a herd of 60 elephants appeared out of the wild to drink from a private swimming pool . The pool is part of The Homestead, a resort on the exclusive Phinda Private Game Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa . Lautenbach, 30, who took the pictures on March 3, has been a guide at the resort for the past eight years. He said that the elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole, but soon turned their attention to the lodge. 'This morning after a rather quiet game drive I had breakfast with the guests and headed off to a rangers meeting in the south of the reserve,' he wrote online. 'The lodge I work at - The Homestead - has a beautiful open plan deck, small gym with two rooms on either side and a pool on the deck overlooking a small waterhole. 'While I was away something spectacular occurred and I was fortunate enough to return just in time to get some photos.' Although there is thick woodland surrounding the waterhole, several herds emerged to go to a nearby waterhole - which was all mud . The elephants had initially arrived to use a nearby waterhole, but soon turned their attention to the lodge and its sprawling pool . 'The view from the lodge is rather open with thick woodland beyond the waterhole, but at around 11 o'clock that morning a herd of elephants emerged from the woodlands and came to drink at the waterhole - a usual but privileged site for guests at Homestead,' he added. 'What we didn't expect was that right behind them another herd arrived, and then another and then another. 'They all went to the small waterhole which had now been depleted at a rapid rate and found there to be just mud. Elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average and its estimated that these herds drank about 6,000 litres in one sitting . 'Instead of moving off to find water elsewhere, they had a mud wallow then turned their attention to the lodge swimming pool. 'By the time I had arrived there were over 60 elephants all around the lodge drinking from the swimming pool two or three at a time. 'They did not have the decency to drink first before wallowing in the mud, turning the water muddy brown before finishing over half the pool water.' The herd spent over three hours drinking, wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush . Experienced guide Mark Lautenbach who has worked on the reserve for eight years, was on hand to photograph the amazing sight . 'Elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average,' Lautenbach explained. 'With easily over 60 elephants all helping themselves to the fresh blue waters of Homestead pool, they must have dank over 6,000 litres of water in one sitting.' Apparently, the elephant herds spent around three hours drinking, wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush. He said: 'I cannot say it was as if they were never here. 'It looked like a Thailand beach party after a full moon with piles of stinky, half-digested dung littered all over the front of the lodge and a few bucket scoops of dirty mud water at the bottom of the pool. 'The deck was splattered with mud and the grass flattened to the ground.'","Several herds of elephants made use of an exclusive resort pool on the Phinda Private Game Reserve .

Kathleen Hampton (above) of Portland, Oregon claims she was refused service and asked to leave Enzo’s Caffe Italiano on Valentine's Day . Hampton showed up for her dinner reservation without her husband and claims the staff waited to seat her and eventually asked her to leave . 'I had a strange feeling when I got there but I didn’t think anything about it until the next set of incidences happen,' said Hampton in court documents obtained by KOIN. Hampton said she arrived for her reservation and said she was alone, and was told there would be a wait. Shortly after, she claims, the staff began seating people who had arrived after her to the restaurant. Then, when she finally was seated at her table, things got even worse for the single diner.

She also claims that she does not believe it was solely the fact that she was single that caused this shocking service . 'I didn’t fit their decor in there,' she said. 'I was the only African American.' And so, she ended up leaving the establishment. 'I cried, I’ve never been so embarrassed and humiliated in my life,' she said.

Also, 21 per cent wanted to learn a new skill while 17 per cent wanted to concentrate purely on their well-being.

RSPCA Inspector Patrick Bailey said: 'I have come across some pretty poorly dogs in my time as an inspector but I can safely say there have been few that have been as thin as this poor lurcher. 'She was completely emaciated, and looked to be just skin stretched over bone. 'She had fur loss from her shoulders down, was absolutely covered in fleas and her claws were long and overgrown.

The dogs, who are both female, are now recovering however it could be some time before the lurcher is in a fit enough state to find a new family. Because of their bond, the canine companions could be re-homed together, but this may not be the possible because the Jack Russell is likely to be healthy enough to be re-homed sooner. Mr Bailey added: 'We don't know how long these dogs have been straying and we don't know how they got there or where they came from. 'It seems unusual that the two dogs were so polar opposite in their health and wellbeing and as such I am keen to hear from anyone who can offer information regarding them, especially the lurcher. 'It is possible that these dogs have been straying independently before joining up to form this mismatched pair and it could be that the lurcher has been fending for herself for quite some time to arrive in this poor condition. 'However she is extremely affectionate, enjoys fuss and attention and seems very keen to be around people. 'She has clearly been socialised but I cannot rule out the possibility that she has been neglected before straying or possibly even being dumped.'

Each bullet point must include exactly one explicit detail directly from the text, such as specific names, ages, dates, numbers, precise locations, or directly stated events. Do NOT include assumptions, opinions, interpretations, explanations, or additional context.",8,"Hong Kong (CNN)Australia's transport safety chief has always described himself as a pessimist. But Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, says that as search teams scour the depths of the Indian Ocean for any sign of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, he is confident they will find the plane, if the aircraft is in the areas where they are looking. ""If anything, I'm slightly more optimistic than six months ago, because we have more confidence in the data, and we have proven the search equipment and techniques work to the necessary standards,"" Dolan said. But as the first anniversary of MH370's disappearance approaches, with no trace of the missing plane found, not everyone shares his outlook. That includes many of the relatives of the 239 passengers and crew on board, who say not a single day goes by without wondering what happened to their loved ones. And for many, the decision in late January by Malaysia to officially declare MH370 an accident, enabling the insurance payout process to begin in accordance with international protocol, was painfully premature. ""How can they say that, when there is no proof that the plane has crashed?"" asked Wen Wang Cheng, whose son Wen Yung Sheng was one of 153 Chinese nationals on board.  ""We have to get the facts,"" Wen said. What families have been told, they say, simply isn't good enough.  Anger, frustration, and distrust pushed some relatives, including Wen, to fly from China to Kuala Lumpur last month, to demand more. But when families submitted a letter to Malaysia Airlines asking for authorities to explain the declaration and status of the investigation, a written response from the company's CEO revealed little that hadn't already been said. At 12:41 a.m. local time on March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, en route to Beijing. Less than an hour later, the Boeing 777-200ER was flying over the South China Sea. Air traffic controllers in Malaysia radioed the crew to contact controllers in Ho Chi Minh City for its onward journey through Vietnamese airspace. The crew acknowledged the request, thanking Kuala Lumpur controllers with a routine reply: ""Good night, Malaysian Three-Seven-Zero.""  Minutes later, the plane disappeared from radar. Malaysian authorities revealed days later that military radar had tracked the plane as it turned back to the west, flew across the Malay Peninsula, and up the Strait of Malacca, before flying out of radar range and vanishing once again. The search area widened, then shifted off the coast of Western Australia, when it was determined through careful analysis of a series of messages or ""handshakes"" between the plane and an Inmarsat telecommunications satellite, that MH370 eventually turned south, and flew for hours into the Indian Ocean. Roughly a week's sail from the coast of Western Australia, ships with specialists and equipment capable of searching depths that regularly exceed 4,000 meters (13,123 feet), work around the clock, methodically ticking off sections of sea floor. In early February a new ship, the Fugro Supporter, joined the search carrying the HUGIN 4500, a programmable unmanned submarine, now scanning areas that other equipment couldn't safely cover, including steep mountain slopes. The ship joins the Discovery and Fugro Equator, both operated by a Dutch survey firm, along with the Malaysian-contracted GO Phoenix. ""I asked specifically to come on this job, because it's a very exciting opportunity to do something that will potentially help a lot of people,"" James Hancock, a surveyor who usually works in the oil industry in the North Sea, told CNN's Anna Coren, as he prepared to embark on a trip on the Fugro Discovery that could last up to six weeks. Since October, more than 24,000 square kilometers -- roughly 40% of what the ATSB calls the ""priority search area"" -- has been scanned, with the remainder of the work scheduled to be finished by May before weather conditions worsen as the southern winter approaches. For now, teams are searching mostly using devices called towfish, which are dragged close to the ocean floor on cables up to 10 kilometers long. It's tough work, even when conditions are perfect.  A number of cyclones, producing waves of up to 16 meters, put the brakes on the search in early February. Dolan is careful to point out search efforts are meeting or exceeding expectations, dismissing concerns over stormy weather or delays in installing equipment as ""part of the deal."" The current search area is the result of months of analysis and reexamination of satellite data by an international team of experts, combined with aircraft performance factors such as fuel range, speed, and altitude. Search ships are focused along the so-called 7th arc, or ""partial handshake,"" where international investigators believe the plane ran out of fuel. ""The thing that really impresses me most about this investigation was how much information we were able to gain through mathematics and science,"" said CNN Safety Analyst David Soucie. But Soucie, a former FAA accident investigator, is not optimistic that the deep-sea search teams will find what they're looking for.  ""I know that they've searched in the most probable areas where it would have been, and it's not there,"" he said. Jeff Wise, a science journalist and author of ""The Plane That Wasn't There,"" took that skepticism a step further, saying it's time to reexamine all the clues.  His latest theory contends that investigators may have misinterpreted a key component of the Inmarsat satellite data, and that MH370 may have instead flown north toward Kazakhstan. ""This is not a normal investigation.  They need to throw out the book,"" said Wise. ""This is unlike anything that's happened in aviation."" But Michael Exner, an engineer with decades of experience in the mobile satellite communications industry, says the data ""accurately and unambiguously"" shows MH370 went down near the 7th arc. ""The current ATSB search strategy remains the best search strategy,"" Exner said. ""They are looking exactly where I expect the plane to be found."" The ATSB's Dolan cautioned that search teams have placed equal priority on all areas within the 60,000 square kilometer search zone.  ""We haven't given up.  Quite the opposite,"" he said. If search teams succeed in locating the wreckage of MH370, Australia, which has been leading the search at Malaysia's request, will also lead salvage and recovery efforts, according to the ATSB Chief Commissioner. But Malaysia, Australia, and China, which had the majority of the passengers on board the flight, have not yet made a decision on whether a recovery will occur, Dolan said. It is unclear what will happen if search teams complete their current mission without finding any sign of the plane. Australia has allocated roughly $48 million to the current phase of the search, with Malaysia promising to contribute equally to the cost.  In January, the Malaysian government said it is committed ""to continue all reasonable efforts to bring closure to this unfortunate tragedy."" One possibility is that the deep-sea search could be extended outside the boundaries of the current priority area, north or south along the 7th arc. The ATSB would not comment on the likelihood of expanding the search, saying that it was a ""decision for governments."" Malaysia also plans to release an interim statement detailing the progress of the investigation into MH370 around March 8 -- though some experts believe it will not contain any information investigators do not already have. Aviation experts say there is a key reason the search should continue until MH370 is found. ""Without knowing what caused it, you can't fix it, you can't make sure it doesn't happen again,"" said Soucie.  ""And I think that's really the biggest tragedy of this, if they don't find the airplane."" For the families of the 239 passengers and crew on board, who have had nothing but hope and prayers to carry them through the past year, it's about finding answers. ""It's very difficult to hear the world closure, when there is no closure,"" Jacquita Gonzales, the wife of lead steward Patrick Gomes, told CNN's Andrew Stevens. And while Gonzales says she holds out hope her husband could return home alive, she is prepared for a difficult discovery. ""If it's there and there's debris, we can have closure and we can lay him at peace. Because I don't think he's at peace right now."" The search for MH370 continues. CNN's Andrew Stevens, Anna Coren, Tim Schwarz, Felicia Wong, Chieu Luu, and Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","Ahead of one year anniversary, search chief says he's confident Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will eventually be found .

Yassine al-Abidi ate breakfast with his family before going to work in a Tunis travel agency. Around 10am on Wednesday he went on a break and met up with fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui before the lethal attack. Friends and relatives said that al-Abidi did not appear to be a religious fanatic but Tunisian authorities said that both men travelled to Libya in September for terrorist training. Yassine al-Abidi had breakfast with his family as normal on morning he and his fellow terrorist Hatem Khachnaoui attacked the Bardo museum on Wednesday killing 23 people and injuring more than 60 others . Al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui pictured were both killed after a four-hour standoff with special forces . Members of al-Abidi's family mourned him at his house, with his uncle claiming that the people his nephew killed were innocent. 'Why did they have to pay the price of a false understanding of Islam . Shortly before he and a friend gunned down 23 people at Tunisia's Bardo museum, Yassine al-Abidi sat down to a breakfast of olive oil and dates with his family and left for work at his travel agency as usual. Relatives said last year al-Abidi began spending an increasing amount of time at a hard-line mosque near his home. His uncle Mohamed Abidi said: 'I am sad for Yassine, but even sadder for the victims that Yassine killed. They were innocent, why did they have to pay the price of a false understanding of Islam. 'They are the victims of terrorism. We are the victims of a demagogic network that wants only death.' Family members said al-Abidi never complained about alcohol being served his his uncle's house or express other extremist views. Terry Burton and Paula Ayres survived Wednesday's terrorist attack because they were on a taxi tour . The couple were passengers on board the MSC Splendida which docked in Barcelona yesterday morning . Sally and Brian Adey  described as ‘avid cruisers’, had been looking forward to their seven-night tour of the Mediterranean aboard MSC Splendida. Mrs Adey was murdered by the terrorists in the attack . His cousin Hanan revealed: 'He was always fun, we danced together at family weddings. He wasn't like hardline Salafists. 'On the last day he had breakfast of dates and olive oil and went to work. At 10 am he asked for a break and went and did what he did. 'He never told us not to watch television, for example.' His mother Zakia added: 'The son I knew could never do what was done.He could not even harm a bird.' Meanwhile, it has emerged that a British couple narrowly avoided getting caught up in the massacre after they decided to go on a taxi tour rather than visit the world-famous museum. The Tunisian health minister Said Aidi, visited some of the survivors recovering in hospital earlier today . Prayers were said for the victims at the Catholic cathedral of St Vincent de Paul in Tunisia earlier today . Terry Burton, 53, and Paula Ayres, 56, from King's Lynn in Norfolk were in the taxi when the driver warned them about the attack and they immediately returned to the ship. Mr Burton said they were in the city of Carthage when the news of the deadly attack was broadcast in Arabic over the radio. Translating from Arabic, their taxi driver told them what had happened before racing them back to their boat telling them: ‘it’s not safe, we need to get out of here.’ Mrs Ayres, a retired teacher, said: ‘He said “eight tourists” and then made this gesture – slitting of the throat. We had a taxi, you pay €60 and he takes you to three different places, five hours maximum. ‘He got the news off the radio. He said “we need to get back straight away”. I was very scared, I wound my window up. He insisted that we got straight back to the boat. Everywhere was closed, the roads sealed off. Overall we were very lucky to miss it all.’ Mr Burton, a carer, said: ‘You think “five minutes this way, ten minutes that way and it could have been you”.’ ‘We have survived our thoughts goes out to the families of those who didn’t.’ There were emotional scenes as passengers disembarked the MSC Splendida in Barcelona . Armed police secured the port area as the cruise ship arrived to reassure the traumatised passengers . The walls and windows were peppered with bullet holes while unused grenades lay scattered among  debris . Meanwhile it has emerged that four armed police officers tasked with protecting the Bordo museum as two terrorists attacked 'were having coffees and a snack' according to one of Tunisia's senior politicians. Abdelfattah Mourou, Vice President of the National Assembly accused four armed police officers of being absent, when in fact they should have been guarding the world-famous institution. Speaking today, Mr Mourou claimed 'two were having coffee' one was 'having a snack' and the final policeman 'could not be found'. The revelations came as hundreds of tourists returned home on board cruise ships which are continuing their Mediterranean tour. Mr Moureau said: 'This was a huge security failure. There had been talks between the army and police about security around the Parliament building the day before the attack.' The lax security revelations emerged as survivors of Wednesday's massacre returned home. There were emotional scenes in Barcelona as passengers who survived the gun attack disembarked the MSC Splendida to be greeted by family members. Some of the passengers complained they did not receive sufficient support on the vessel after the attack . It is understood that 27 people who arrived in Tunis aboard the vessel were not on board in Barcelona . Survivors said nobody was in the mood for dancing as the vessel made the 26-hour journey from Tunisia . Some of the passengers are continuing their cruise through the Mediterranean despite their ordeal . British victim Sally Adey had been onboard the MSC Splendida which docked on Wednesday in Tunis. She and her husband Robert, had boarded a bus with fellow passengers to the Bardo museum. Last night Mr Adey was preparing to fly home to England with her body. Two men, Yassine al-Abidi and Hatem Khachnaoui stood outside the museum, watching as the passengers ambled off the coaches. The pair, who had been trained in Libya, raised their Kalashnikov AK47 assault rifles and fired directly at the tourists. The MSC Splendida arrived in Barcelona with 27 fewer passengers after its 26-hour journey from Tunis. Many of the passengers seemed visibly shocked as they assembled on the quayside . Passengers disembarking in Barcelona criticised the ship's crew over the 'very cold treatment' they received after their ordeal. Josep Lluis Cusido, 64, told the Spanish National news agency EFE: 'When we got back to the ship we were completely traumatised and while the other passengers applauded us as everyone was crying, we got virtually no attention from the crew. They were very cold.' Mr Cusido said the ship's captain addressed the passengers inside a theatre and apologised. However, Mr Cusido, who is a Socialist mayor of a small Spanish village said he took the microphone to make his own protest. He said: 'It was a miracle that we were alive, that we were people with feelings and not commercial objects that came to the ship just to spend money, and that we should be looked after. We were treated much better after that.' Passengers had been told prior to the trip to the Bardo Museum, they were told that Tunisia has been a democracy since 2011 and was quite safe. Mr Cusido added: 'We are recovering little by little, but there are some images we won't be able to rub-out from our lives because they were terrible...I'm still thinking about the dead who fell at my side and that I could have been one of them, because they were shooting with total coldness at the people.' Hostages flee the museum during the Tunisian special forces raid which ended in the death of both gunmen . Victoria Bronskaya, a 33-year-old tour guide from Belarus, was on a bus parked outside the National Bardo Museum in Tunis along with her mother when the attackers struck. 'We threw ourselves to the floor and they started shooting at the bus. I wasn't even afraid. You just think about saving yourself. I shouted ""God save me"" in Russian.' As she and others cowered inside, the gunmen shot two other tourists trying to board the bus. The dead bodies blocked the door of the vehicle. She added: 'That is why the terrorist could not get on board.' Ms Bronsakaya said she and her mother were trapped on board the bus for four hours before being eventually led to safety. She said: 'We only started to cry afterwards, when we saw the Tunisian people taking pity on us, saying: ""Forgive us"".' Newlyweds Francisco Buciegas and his wife Inma, from Cordoba, stepped off shocked after their honeymoon was cut short. Inma, who is four-months pregnant said: ''The whole thing was really awful. It made us really anxious. A passenger, Josefa Ramirez, from Malaga in Spain, who was on the boat with her husband Jose Pinto, said she had dined at the same table as that couple on board the Splendida. Mrs Ramierez said: 'Their children had paid for the cruise for their 50th wedding anniversary. Seven hundred passengers on the Splendida ended their cruise in Barcelona, while the hundreds of others stayed on board to continue their cruise around the Mediterranean. Piot Henri from the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion said: 'It was very sad last night. Nobody was dancing.' As investigations into the massacre continue, Tunisian security officials have been asked why the world-famous museum was completely unprotected.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

But many of these products also contain cancer-causing chemicals, a new study has warned. Australian researchers found that common products marketed as ‘green’, ‘all-natural’, ‘non-toxic’ and ‘organic’ emit compounds that could harm health and air quality. At this time, consumer products sold in Australia, the US and around the world are not required to list all ingredients, or any ingredients in a chemical mixture called 'fragrance'. This means consumers cannot check what the item contains and whether it is potentially dangerous. Household items marketed as 'green', 'organic', 'all-natural’ and ‘non-toxic’ could still emit compounds that damage health, a study has warned . The researchers analysed 37 different products, such as air fresheners, cleaning products, laundry supplies and personal care products found all over the world, including those that claimed to be ‘green’ or ‘organic’. Then, they investigated the number of volatile organic compounds (VOC) the products emitted. VOCs are a large group of carbon-based chemicals that easily evaporate and get into the air at room temperature. They can cause short term health effects including irritating the throat and mouth, causing dizziness and can make conditions like asthma worse. In the long term, exposure to these compounds has been linked with an increased risk of cancer, liver damage, kidney damage and damage to the nervous system. The reseachers found 156 different VOCs emitted from the products, with an average of 15 VOCs per product. Of these 156 VOCs, 42 are classified as toxic or hazardous under US federal laws, and each product emitted at least one of these chemicals. They found the cancer-causing pollutants were found in many of the fragranced ‘green’ products . And they were just as damaging as those from regular chemical products that aren't marketed as organic, researchers said. The most common chemicals in fragranced products were terpenes, which were not in fragrance-free versions. Researchers analysed 37 household products and found they all emitted volatile organic compounds (pictured). These are chemicals that get into the air easily and have been linked with cancer and liver damage . Terpenes react very quickly with ozone (a pale blue gas found in the air) to generate pollutants such as formaldehyde and ultrafine particles, the researchers said. The researchers also warned that fewer than three per cent were disclosed product labels or product information. Lead author Professor Anne Steinman, of Melbourne School of Engineering, said this means the public is unable to check which chemicals their household products contain. She said: 'The paradox is that most of our exposure to air pollutants occurs indoors and a primary source is consumer products. ‘But the public lacks full and accurate information on the ingredients in these products. ‘Our indoor air environments are essentially unregulated and unmonitored. ‘Given the lack of information, consumers may choose products with claims such as green, natural, or organic, but those claims are largely untested.’","Experts analysed 37 household products including those billed as 'green'

The condition is not acknowledged by Western medicine, which considers it psychological. Iconic:  The Canadian-born singer won eight Grammys in her career and was one of the most iconic stars of her generation . In the memoir, Joni Mitchell: In Her Own Words, she revealed: 'At the height of my illness I could not even wear clothing. 'All the time it felt like I was being eaten alive by parasites living under my skin. I couldn't leave my house for several years. 'Sometimes it got so bad I couldn't walk and I'd have to crawl across the floor. My legs would cramp up, just like I was having a polio spasm.'

He's 41, has an extensive criminal record and served time in prison, according to online inmates records. He's on probation. Giroux used to have tattoos indicating white supremacist beliefs on his face but apparently had them removed, according to photos. One thing investigators don't know: What caused Giroux to allegedly go on a deadly rampage. On Thursday morning, Giroux made his first court appearance. He faces multiple charges, including murder, armed robbery with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, aggravated assault and burglary. The prosecutor requested $2 million bond and the judge imposed it. Grioux has been sent to prison twice for felonies, including an attempt to commit aggravated assault. He was sentenced to seven years and six months behind bars in July 2007, but was released in October 2013, according to online inmate records. His probation runs through October 2016. He also had a run-in with authorities in Santa Monica, California. He allegedly committed assault with a knife in the early morning hours of March 26, 2006, and was detained by witnesses, said Santa Monica Police spokesman Sgt. Rudy Camarena. Giroux was arrested on accusations of attempted murder and parole violation, but police records weren't immediately clear on how the case was resolved, Camarena said Thursday. Police are looking for a motive in the first shooting on Wednesday, but say the other violence happened as the suspect tried to rob people and get away from authorities. The first shots were fired after the suspect got into an argument at the Tri-City Inn with three people that he likely knew, according to Det. Esteban Flores of the Mesa police. One man shot at the Tri-City Inn died, Flores said. Police identified him as David James Williams, 29, reported CNN affiliate KNXV. The motel is across the street from the East Valley Institute of Technology. According to a police press release, the suspect next shot a man during a carjacking at a nearby restaurant and drove away in a stolen Honda Accord. Grioux tried to carjack another vehicle but failed, police said, and crossed the street to break into an apartment, where he shot and tried to rob a fifth person. He went to another apartment complex and shot a sixth person, police said, before fleeing to a condominium complex. Flores said Mesa's SWAT team found Grioux in a vacant second-floor condo. Police used a Taser stun gun to subdue him. Police said one man is in critical condition at a hospital, KNXV reported. The other victims, including the mother of the slain man, were treated and released from hospitals, KNXV reported. Authorities on Thursday released a photo of a bruised Giroux in which he had a tattoo on his neck but no tattoos on his face. An Arizona Department of Correction's photo released earlier showed a heavily tattooed Giroux, with the words ""Skin"" and ""head"" tattooed over his eyebrows. The number 88 was on his left temple, with additional ink on his chin and neck. ""Those are typical tattoos that you do see sometimes on white supremacists, but we don't know if that has anything to do with what happened today,"" Flores said. Neo-Nazis use the number 88 as an abbreviation for ""Heil Hitler.""  H is the eighth letter in the alphabet, so the Nazi salute becomes 88 in shorthand. Flores said he believes all of the shooting victims were white, with one being white and of Hispanic descent. ""I have no information that his (Giroux's) affiliations or beliefs had anything to do with what occurred today,"" Flores said. News of the shootings caught the attention of the state's senior U.S. senator. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families impacted by the tragedy in Mesa today,"" U.S. Sen. John McCain said in a statement released Wednesday.  ""Our deepest thanks are with the Valley police and first responders who assisted the victims and tracked down the perpetrator to bring this dangerous situation to an end."" Mesa is about 20 miles east of Phoenix and is Arizona's third-largest city.

A candidate hoping to be elected Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky claims he was arrested for not returning an overdue library book. Johnathan Masters, 33,  was pulled over by a state trooper on Wednesday and apparently taken to jail over a book he withdrew 11 years ago. Masters - who says the charge is nonsense - claims the officer initially pulled him over for having expired tax stickers on his car . An online booking record for Masters says only that he was arrested for an outstanding warrant. But he says he was told the reason was a theft charge, linked to allegedly borrowing the book and never giving it back,  the Huffington Post reported. Masters denies the apparent charge - theft by failure to make required disposition of property - and says he will clear his name in court. Defending himself to Fox News, he said he had never even withdrawn a library book in Kenton County, where he claims the charge originates. Of the arrest, Masters said: 'I thought he was going to let me go because he was real friendly, but then he went back to his patrol car and was gone for about 15 minutes. 'When he came back, he asked me, ""Did you take out a library book 11 years ago?"" 'I started to laugh, but he said, ""This is serious!"" and he took me to jail for three hours. I plan to fight the charges.' Masters was let out of jail after paying a $100 bond, and is expected to appear in court later this month. He has been beset by legal troubles since his candidacy emerged. He is the running-mate of Geoff Young, who mounted a failed bid for Congress in 2014. Governor's race: Masters is running with Geoff Young, left, in the Democratic primary against front-runner Jack Conway, the state's Attorney General (right) The two hope to defeat front runner Jack Conway, the state Attorney General, in the Democratic primary elections this May. As part of his campaign, Young issued a lawsuit against Conway and other leading Democrats, accusing them of ignoring his campaign to secure victory in the primary. In the legal complaint he compares incumbent governor Steve Beshear to Stalin. Should they win, they would then face the Republican candidate in November's general election. According to the Louisville Courier-Journal, Masters is also waiting for his day in court on harassment charges. He is accused of making expletive-laden calls to an associate dean at Spalding University, demanding his money back after being kicked out of the school. The paper also reported that there is a pending arrest warrant over claims he threatened to beat up a principal after being told he couldn't enter a school to conduct a survey. He reportedly yelled 'come out here so I can kick your ass' in the December 17 visit. He has yet to be served with the warrant in the second case. Masters runs a political blog called The Freedom Skool. His entries include several long posts about the medicinal benefits of marijuana, and a string of multi-colored, edited photographs of his running-mate. In response to the harassment charges, Patrick Hughes, chairman of the Kentucky Democrats, told the Courier-Journal that Masters and Young 'don't have a snowball's chance' of victory. Speaking to Daily Mail Online today, Young said he is 'standing behind' Masters despite the accusations. Of the library book, he said: 'I don't think it says much about whether he's fit for office'.","Johnathan Masters, 33, was pulled over Wednesday by state troopers .

Fearing a cover-up, MPs and legal experts want to know whether the four were looking at X-rated material while presiding over trials. Two are known to have overseen cases in which the charges related to pornography or sex offending. Three were viewing explicit material in their chambers. Andrew Maw, left, resigned before he could be sacked while Immigration judge Warren Grant, right,  confirmed today he lost his job for viewing porn on official judicial equipment . But senior judges and the judicial disciplinary board refused to give any detail about the ‘inappropriate’ activities of the judges. And officials declined to say whether criminal charges had been considered or whether their summary departures will affect their judicial pensions. A criminal charge of misconduct in public office can be brought when a public officer ‘wilfully misconducts himself to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public’s trust’. London immigration judge Warren Grant, district judge Timothy Bowles of Romford county court and recorder Peter Bullock, who worked on the north-eastern circuit, were all sacked for viewing pornographic material. Recorder Andrew Maw, who worked at Lincoln county court, resigned before he could be forced out. An official statement said he had ‘viewed similar inappropriate material via his judicial IT account’ and would have been removed from office ‘had he not resigned before the conclusion of the disciplinary process’. David Green, a criminologist at the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘We need to know what kind of cases they were dealing with and whether the material they were looking at was relevant to those cases. That is how their behaviour could have become a matter of conduct in office. ‘The issue is: What do we know about the cases they were hearing? This could be important for the administration of justice. Sex scandals being regularly unearthed have made us all suspicious about the behaviour of public officials.’ Recorders are qualified to preside over crown court criminal trials. But the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which handles disciplinary complaints against judges and magistrates, refused to give any information about the misconduct or the cases the judges dealt. This means no one can know whether their judge was watching pornography during recesses in their own case or whether cases that might have involved complicated sexual issues were being run by a judge who was using pornography in his office during the trial. The dismissal of so many judges in one day – and behind closed doors – provoked disquiet in Westminster and among legal experts. Liberal Democrat John Hemming, who campaigns for open justice, said: ‘I am concerned about the lack of transparency in the running of the judiciary. We know little about what happened here, but it was considered serious enough for the judges to be dismissed. This is one key aspect of concern over transparency in the judiciary.’ Sacked: Three judges have been fired and one resigned after being caught watching porn on work computers . Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘It is a cardinal rule that British justice is not just done, but also seen to be done. Those upholding the law need to be held to similar standards of transparency and accountability.’ One of the four judges jailed a teacher for downloading child pornography and another sentenced a Peeping Tom for using a mobile phone to film women in swimming pool changing rooms. A statement from the Investigations Office said the three men ‘have been removed from judicial office following an investigation into an allegation that they viewed pornographic material on judicial IT equipment in their offices.’ It said the judges were not linked in any way. The statement added that ‘the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice were satisfied that the material did not include images of children or any other illegal content, but concluded that this was an inexcusable misuse of their judicial IT accounts and wholly unacceptable conduct for a judicial office holder’. The sackings came less than two months after the Lord Chief Justice told MPs of the seriousness with which he regards ‘extreme’ pornography. Lord Thomas told the Commons justice committee he believed a recent murder case illustrated ‘that the peddling of pornography on the internet had had a dramatic effect on an individual’ and that is what is available now to download and to see … is simply horrific’. The secretive disciplinary process culminated in the dismissal rulings by Lord Thomas and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who make the final decision when serious allegations are made against judges or magistrates. No details were given about how the allegation of viewing pornography on office computers came to be made against judges in four different courts. There was speculation the judges’ misuse of office computers could have been noticed as part of security checks of IT systems. The disciplinary process run by the JCIO was revamped in 2013 when the organisation ceased to be known as the Judicial Complaints Office. It has 15 staff, headed by Judith Anckorn, and took disciplinary action in 58 cases from more than 2000 referred to it in the 2013/14 financial year. Judges may be called in to supervise investigations, and judges who are facing serious allegations have a right to be heard by a disciplinary panel, which is held behind closed doors. Yesterday’s statement said that the pornography viewed by the judges did not have illegal content, but it did not say whether other criminal charges were considered in their cases. The action against the judges is not thought to have included measures to curb or confiscate their pension entitlement. An immigration judge in London currently earns an annual salary of £121,450 and a district judge commands £115,489. The judicial pension scheme has long offered equivalent to half the judge’s salary after 20 years of service. They sat in judgment over sex offences . One of the four disgraced judges once jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography. Matthew Curtis was arrested after the FBI found he had paid two American sellers for child porn in 1999. The teacher at Bourne Grammar School in Lincolnshire said he was not responsible for the 17 images found on his school computer. But ANDREW MAW jailed Curtis for eight months in 2004 and told him: ‘Were it not for these matters, I am sure you would have risen high up in your chosen profession. ‘It is only by your actions that you have thrown it all away.’ Mr Maw was a recorder sitting at Northampton Crown Court at the time. He retired from the bench in September, before the investigation into the misuse of his own computer was concluded. The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said he would have been sacked had he not retired. Mr Maw, 66, a married father of three, lives in Lichfield, Staffordshire. The former judge was admitted as a solicitor in 1973 and was appointed a recorder in 2000. Mr Maw attended the former Wintringham Grammar near Grimsby. Andrew Maw was a recorder sitting at Northampton Crown Court (pictured) in 2004 when he jailed a teacher caught downloading child pornography . He was chairman of the Grimsby Everyman Club. He was also a member of the Grimsby St James Rotary Club before relocating to Lichfield. He was most recently recorder at Lincoln county court, dealing with civil and family cases, but also sat on criminal cases at the crown courts in Derby and Grimsby. Another of the disgraced judges, PETER BULLOCK, once banned a pervert from swimming pools after he was caught filming women undressing on his mobile phone. He ordered the offender not to enter any municipal pools and gave him a three-year community order. Mr Bullock, 70, was a deputy district judge and recorder on the north-eastern court circuit before his dismissal. The father of two lives in Cramlington, a small town in Northumberland. He refused to comment at his detached £275,000 home yesterday. A relative said: ‘He doesn’t want to talk.’ The third judge sacked for viewing porn on his work computer said he had been suffering from ‘severe and undiagnosed depression’ at the time. WARREN GRANT, 60, a married father of five, was an immigration judge in London and believed to be earning £128,000 a year. In a statement released yesterday, he said: ‘I do not wish to comment save to say that for some years before, and during, the period covered by the conduct which formed the subject of the complaint laid against me I was suffering from severe and undiagnosed depression. I request that the privacy of my family and myself be respected so that we are allowed to continue with our lives.’ Mr Grant lives in Golders Green, North London. He attended the independent Royal Grammar School in Newcastle before studying law at St Catherine’s College, Cambridge. He speaks five languages including French and Hebrew and also plays in a jazz band. TIMOTHY BOWLES, 53, was a district judge at Romford county court. District judges are full-time officials who deal with a range of family and civil cases.","Judges Tim Bowles, Warren Grant and Peter Bullock lose jobs in scandal .

The ISIS interviewer asks one child, who is standing alongside an armed companion, what his life is like under the Islamic State caliphate . The scenes could be from any park, anywhere in the world, but these children live under the control of ISIS . The video, entitled 'Citizens’ Days Out in the Shadow of the Islamic State' and published today, is an attempt to depict an idealised version of everyday life under the caliphate. Charlie Winter, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation, a counter-extremism think tank, analysed the footage. 'In the video, we see men and children playing in Dijla City theme park, which is located just on the outside of Mosul in northern Iraq,' Mr Winter said. 'While it may seem a strange addition to IS’s propaganda repertoire, is nothing unusual. 'Just as they do in many other videos like this, the propagandists are peddling the idea that there has been a total reversal of the status quo for Sunni Muslims in IS-held territory.

He replies: 'It is a life that is comfortable and God has willed it that it is like this in the Islamic State, which will remain by the permission of God.' Another reveals it is 'very good' and he is 'at ease'. A man, who carries a young girl in his arms, tells the interviewer: 'I mean, this situation is what God prefers, he is great, it is preferred by God the Almighty, all is good here, there is security that is enviable.

Dyke revealed on Monday that he wanted to increase the minimum number of homegrown players in club squads from eight to 12 in order to help the England team. Platini, speaking after being elected unopposed for a third term at the UEFA Congress in Vienna, is the best possible ally for Dyke, who is sure to face formidable opposition from the all-powerful Premier League. UEFA president Michel Platini agrees with Gerg Dyke's plans to increase number of homegrown players . The FA chairman wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 . Greg Dyke wants more homegrown players in Premier League teams, raising the number per squad from eight to 12. But only three current squads fall short of that number, though many of their homegrown players have yet to play for the first team. Chelsea (11): . Cesc Fabregas, Gary Cahill, John Terry, Nathan Ake, Andreas Christensen, Jeremie Boga, Mitchell Beeney, Dominic Solanke, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Isaiah Brown, Jamal Blackman. Tottenham (9): . Kyle Walker, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason, Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb, Ben Davies, Harry Winks, Joshua Onomah. Manchester City (8): . Joe Hart, James Milner, Frank Lampard, Gael Clichy, Richard Wright, Dedryck Boyata, Bersant Celina, Jose Pozo. Platini said: ‘This is a position we defend. We’re not only talking about England, we’re talking all of Europe. Mr Dyke’s struggle with the FA is something we share and we agree with him. With the new leader of the European Commission (Jean-Claude Juncker), it is important we establish close relations to see how we can protect homegrown, grassroots young players. ‘We share the same perspective. We will work hand in hand to defend an idea that we think is the right one. There is free flow of workers in Europe but there are some things that doesn’t apply to, like in this case.’ UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino was also enthusiastic about Dyke’s mission. He said: ‘It’s fantastic. Eight out of 25 (the number of home-grown players that currently must be included in a Champions League squad) is not as many as it should be. So whatever move in favour of increasing homegrown players is something we can only support. Congratulations to England.’ Dyke’s proposals have irritated the Premier League who never like being dictated to by the FA. Dyke said on Tuesday: ‘We’re open to discussions and I’d like to persuade some of the clubs this is an issue.’ Dyke's plans also include 'home-grown' players having to train in England for three years before the age of 18 . Manchester United director David Gill said the proposals needed 'to be discussed by all the stakeholders' It could make for some tension between Dyke and the Premier League at the club summit tomorrow, especially as the Professional Game representatives on the FA Board had advised Dyke (left) last week not to go public. Manchester United director David Gill sits on the UEFA ExCo and will join the FIFA ExCo in May after his election on Tuesday as the British vice-president. Gill, who is also a PL representative on the FA board, said: ‘It’s a relevant thing to look at, but it needs to be discussed by all the stakeholders.’ Michael Carrick said he would love more homegrown players to get opportunities but admitted it is difficult . Carrick said that the system doesn't always work in favour of players like it has for Harry Kane of late . United and England midfielder Michael Carrick said: ‘We’d all love more homegrown, British players to get opportunities. It’s difficult. There are two sides to the argument: you’ve got to be good enough to get the chance in the first place but someone’s got to give you that chance. ‘Someone like Harry Kane is the perfect example of how we’d all like it to be. He gets his chance and takes it and has elevated himself to another level. ‘But it doesn’t always work like that. Plenty of times you look at young lads and think, he’s got a chance but it doesn’t quite work.’ England team-mate Gary Cahill said: ‘I agree with some aspects. I think it’s important to have a mixture. I love to see young players getting opportunities. But I’m respectful of the fact that the Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world and it attracts some of the top players. ‘Fans want to see exciting players and top clubs want top players and sometimes they are overseas. It is a matter of getting that balance.’ Gary Cahill wants more young players to get opportunities but respected the Premier League's position . Cahill hopes a balance can be reached between the quality of the league and young players coming through . Ritchie Humphreys, the PFA chairman and an FA Commission member, said: ‘Any foreign player who comes to this country we welcome. But we also have a duty of care to our national game and to young homegrown players. ‘Everything we are working towards on the FA Commission is with the aim of making our national side more competitive at elite level. The PFA supports that.’","FA chairman proposed raising the minimum number of home-grown players from eight to 12 at Premier League clubs .

She later died at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff. Scroll down for video . Mother-of-four Rhona Greve, 64, (pictured) died after she was savaged by a dog in her own home . Mr Greve is charged with both having a dog while being banned for life from doing so, and being the owner of a dangerously out of control dog. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at the magistrates' court hearing today. Members of his family and friends were in the public gallery for the hearing which lasted nearly an hour. The case has been sent to Cardiff crown court and he was remanded in custody. Her heartbroken daughter Clare said: 'I got the call to say: ""Your mum's been savaged by a dog"". 'It all happened so quickly. When I arrived at hospital she was already gone. 'They asked me if I wanted to see her body but I didn't have the heart. I didn't want to see her like that. She added: 'She was a brilliant mum and she didn't deserve to go like that. I can only imagine what Craig is going through right now. He must be devastated. 'We're all waiting to find out more about what has happened. You just never expect something like this.' Officers were called to the home in Ely shortly after 10pm on Friday to reports that a 64-year-old woman had suffered serious injuries . The court heard how grandson Greve lived with his grandmother - and was brought up 'like her own child'. She took him in when his mother Amanda, 40, had a stroke at a 'very young age'. Greve told police how he returned home to find the American bulldog standing above his grandmother in the kitchen. Mrs Greve suffered neck and face injuries after she was mauled by the out-of-control dog . Prosecutor Katy McMahon said: 'As a result of the dog being out of control, it has caused harm to Rhona Greve resulting in her death. 'She sustained significant injuries and died later in hospital.' Police were called by neighbours and the court heard officers said the dog was 'snarling with blood on its teeth.' Miss McMahon said: 'Officers described the dog as going beserk.' His lawyer Trudy McBride said: 'This is an extremely tragic case. He is the grandson of the deceased. He saw what happened and was with her when she passed away.' Rhona had been a full-time carer for her husband Malcolm as he battled lung disease emphysema. After his death more than five years ago Rhona loved the American bulldog keeping her company. A friend said: 'She loved that dog and he kept her company. We can't think what happened to make Solo turn like that.' Another said: 'She was a real lover of people and their pets. She loved having people around and their pets too.' Rhona had four children - three daughters and a son who died at a young age. She also had 21 grandchildren. Flowers and tributes have been laid at the house which has now been taped off by police. Local councillor Susan Goddard said: 'This is a terrible tragedy, it's just too awful to comprehend. It's terrible.' A 17-year-old boy who was also arrested in connection with the incident has been released on police bail pending further inquiries.

The paint-like swirls depict global water-surface temperatures around the world, with the surface texture driven by the rotation of the Earth. Using data from various climate models, trapped regions of warmer water, shown in red, are seen adjacent to the Gulf Stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. The paint-like swirls of this visualisation depict global water-surface temperatures. Cool temperatures are shown by blues and warmer temperatures by reds. Trapped regions of warmer water adjacent to the Gulf Stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. indicate the model’s capability to simulate eddy transport of heat within the ocean, a key component necessary to accurately simulate global climate change . The model, by the Los Alamos National Laboratory, is used to simulate eddy transportation of heat within the ocean, a key component necessary to accurately simulate climate change. These are circular movements of water, counter to a main current, causing a small whirlpool. ‘Computer models of the global ocean must capture these eddies and their impact on ocean circulation in order to accurately represent the climate system and future climate change,’ LANL says. ‘This is difficult because the small size (10–100 km) of eddies requires high spatial resolution and substantial computing power’. Global ocean surface kinetic - or movement - energy is pictured here. The maximum kinetic energy shown by white with minimum values in black. Color is on a log scale. Observe the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. with adjacent eddy rings . The world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change, scientists have warned. US researchers claim that the fast onset of global warming is set to alter the way people live, even over short time scales. This is according to new evidence which suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25°C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. The analysis was based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world . Scientists recently announced that sea surface water temperatures have been warmer than average in the western and central Pacific Ocean and have started to alter wind patterns. The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance El Niño will continue through the summer. However, they say that the El Niño conditions are currently 'extremely weak' and come at a time of the year when the influence of El Niño on weather patterns usually declines. This means that while El Niño conditions normally brings wetter weather to the northern hemisphere in the summer, it is unlikely to be bring substantially more rainfall than this spring. In another image the ocean surface kinetic energy – or movement energy – is revealed with maximum kinetic energy in white with minimum values in black. The illustration shows the prominent jet stream off the eastern coast of the U.S. with adjacent eddy rings. When winds blow across the ocean, kinetic energy is transferred from the wind to water as a result of the friction between the wind and the sea surface. Sunlight on the oceans also adds thermal energy to the surface layer, and currents carry the thermal energy to other regions of the world.","In one mesmerising image, the paint-like swirls depict global water-surface temperatures around the world .

Michelle Parker, 33, of Orlando was last seen November 17 dropping her three-year-old twins off at the home of ex-fiancé Dale Smith, whose legal quarrel over a $5,000 engagement ring featured in an episode of the show recorded earlier that year. WOFL reported about 100 officers searched an area of Belle Isle about two miles south of Orlando International Airport without finding any trace of Parker, whose cell phone last pinged nearby. Disappeared: Michelle Parker (left), who disappeared in 2011 at age 33, was seen the same day on an episode of The People's Court, where she was sued by ex-fiance Dale Smith (right) over a $5000 engagement ring . Police have searched the area before, and though the three-hour investigation of the grounds did not turn up any new evidence, it was heartening for Parker's parents. 'I don’t like it. It makes me angry that we have to go through this all the type because it’s really painful and hard but I’m happy,' Parker's mother Yvonne Stewart said according to News 13. Parker's Hummer had been found the day after she disappeared at an apartment complex in Orlando with the decals for her tanning business peeled from the windows. Her family has continuously pushed for answers about her disappearance. 'It's agony not knowing what happened to your child,' Stewart told ABC. 'They thought they should go back and take a look at these woods.' Stewart says authorities told her one piece of evidence police hoped to find was the missing decal that might have been taken from the Hummer. Training exercise: Police searched a wooded area near the Orlando International Airport for any clues as to the disappearance of Parker . Investigation continues: Though the family still harbors hope that authorities will uncover new evidence about Parker's disappearance, the case has cooled over the past few years . No leads: Smith, pictured during the show, is the only person of interest in his ex-fiancee's disappearance, but has never been charged . Distraught: Parker's mother and other family members have pushed hard for investigations to continue in spite of little evidence noting Parker's whereabouts . 'I don't want to find her dead. I want to find her alive,' said Parker's father, Brad. On the episode of courtroom series 'The People's Court,' recorded the summer before her disappearance, Parker and Smith squared off over a $5,000 engagement ring. The show revealed a 'violent' history of her relationship with Smith, who had been dishonorably discharged from the Marines in 2003 following a reported court martial and military convictions for drug possession and domestic battery. Smith was charged with domestic battery during their relationship, after which Parker filed a request for a restraining order in 2009, which was denied, . In her filing she said he 'smashed the passenger side window in my SUV' and 'took car seats out and threw them in the road'. She also alleged that he yelled to her: 'Your day is coming.' 'He gets pretty malicious and vindictive,' she said of him on The People's Court, 'and he's a mean person especially when he's been drinking.' Smith had sued Parker, claiming she lost the engagement ring when she threw it at him in a fight at a Hilton hotel during a science fiction convention. People's Court judge Marilyn Milian found in favor of Smith on the episode and ordered Parker to pay $2,500. A friend, Angela Launer, told ABC around the time of the disappearance that Smith was known to abandon Parker in out of the way places. 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing the relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'. Police have not charged Smith in relation to his ex-fiancée's disappearance, but he is currently being considered a person of interest in the investigation. Smith currently has custody of the couple's twin children. Parker also had a son from a previous relationship who was 10 years old at the time of her disappearance. An attorney for Smith told ABC that Smith had not committed any crime. The family revealed after her disappearance that Parker left a short message the day before she went missing in which she sounded normal and asked her father to make plans to call her. ‘Hey Dad, it's about 8:40. This is Michelle on Wednesday morning,’ she said. ‘I know that you're at work, but call me when you have lunch or you have break or the end of your day.’ The family spent Thanksgiving with about 50 volunteers, searing within a two-mile radius from a cell tower that had last pinged her location, reported the Orlando Sentinel. ‘I'm thankful that my sister has not been found in a bad way, because every day that doesn't happen, I still have hope that she's still out there somewhere,’ her sister Lauren Erickson told ABC at the time. Her friend Angela Launer told ABC Mr Smith was known to abandon her in out of the way places. 'I know he hurt her many times - dropped her off in areas with no shoes. Took off and left her in Georgia by herself,' Ms Launer, 34, said, describing their relationship as 'rocky' and 'tense'. Parker's mother, Yvonne Stewart, has maintained that Smith is not responsible for her daughter's disappearance. 'Who would want to hurt the mother of their children?' she told ABC. 'I don't see how in any way he would benefit from it. I know in my heart of heart that she's been carjacked.’ 'That the people saw an expensive car and a girl who looks like she has money and I know they've made a mistake and I know that they want to fix this and I forgive them.’","Michelle Parker, 33, of Orlando went missing hours after an episode of The People's Court starring her and her ex-fiance, Dale Smith .

'At a recent dinner party I shared bread and olive oil, followed by chocolate ice cream with my husband. A woman near me looked at me, appalled, and I thought, ""I don't care,""' she writes. Women over 50 typically have to choose between preserving either their face or their butts and she writes that she has happily chosen the former. 'Dieting is out of my purview,' she confesses. 'I crave cookies... all the things that dilate my pupils.' Her skinny friends and their constant battles to remain thin only reinforce her belief that she is doing what is right for her. 'They maintain their weight by routinely vomiting after major meals consisting of a slice of steak or a filet of fish,' she writes. 'I am incapable of this.' In her new book, A Fine Romance, Candice Bergen talks at her joy at playing feisty TV reporter Murphy Brown for 10 seasons.  'She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless,' she writes . The brutally honest appraisal of her current weight is just one of the topics up for discussioin in her new book, which comes out on April 7, reports Vogue. The follow-up to her 1984 memoir Knock Wood, A Fine Romance focuses on her 15-year marriage to French director Louis Malle who died of cancer in 1995 and her career-defining role as funny, feisty career woman and TV news reporter Murphy Brown. The hit TV show ran for ten seasons between 1989 and 1998 and Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five. After her fifth win, Bergen declined future nominations for the role. Initially she writes that she wasn't thrilled at the idea of acting in a TV show, but after reading the script she realized it was 'written for me.' 'The lead was a television news reporter. She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless. 'Smart, fast-paced, and funny, the dialogue was similar to the great comedies of the 1940s. Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five, for her role as Murphy Brown, left. In the 1960s she had also modeled for Vogue as her acting career was taking off, right . 'There was something in the writing of the Murphy character that hooked me, as she eventually hooked many women. 'Is it that she was, in many ways, who we wished we could be as women? Successful in a field dominated by men? Free of the need to please? Impolitic, impolite, yet in some weird way, irresistible?' Despite the network initially trying to have the role rewritten for a younger actress such as Heather Locklear, writer-producer Diane English insisted it had to be about a 40-something woman fresh out of the Betty Ford clinic. 'The character fit me like a glove. I was instantly comfortable with the writing,' recalls Bergen. 'Diane had created a complex, original, endearing, feisty, take-no-prisoners woman. And more surprisingly, a woman who cared not a whit what others thought of her. That character gave me permission to be my brattiest, bawdiest self.' Bergen writes that the character was the first time she felt able to thrown myself into a role 'with such abandon and joy.' Bergen won acclaim early in her acting career for roles in movies such as The Adventurers, left, and has a new autobiography, A Fine Romance, out in April . After working as a fashion model and featuring on the cover of Vogue, Bergen's acting career began in the mid-60s with films such as The Sand Pebbles and The Adventurers. In 1979 she received best supporting Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Starting Over. But while her big screen roles had played on her 'glacial Nordic looks', the role of Murphy Brown allowed her to express must more range. 'What I had going for me was the element of surprise. No one ever expected me to be funny, not least because of my glacial Nordic looks and affect,' she writes. 'I'd mostly been reviled in my acting career. My Oscar nomination for Starting Over was an anomaly; basically I'd had fifteen years of bad notices by the time Murphy came along.' As well as receiving recognition for her acting talent, Bergen said the role also saw her receive recognition as a style icon. 'I wanted every outfit to be an event. And in a way, they were. Women loved what Murphy wore,' she writes. Bergen even lays claim to inventing the open-backed baseball cap. Bergen was married for 15 years to French director Louis Malle before he died of cancer in 1995 . 'When I wanted to wear a baseball cap with a high ponytail, we couldn't find one with an opening in the back, so Judy McGiveney, our wardrobe woman, made one by cutting a hole in the back,' she writes. 'A couple of months after the show aired, you could buy them in any store. Now they're standard.' Bergen writes that she enjoyed ten years of 'insane fun' playing Brown. 'Yet I never wanted it to end; doing Murphy Brown was insanely fun. When the writing was good, it was a giddy, joyous experience. I was the most comfortable and confident I'd ever been,' she writes. 'The part was a godsend—a fantastic role that completely suited me. My friends were all happy for me; it was unusual for a woman my age to get that role and that success.' Since the show ended in 1998, Bergen has appeared in movies including Miss Congeniality and Sweet Home Alabama, as well as staring in Boston Legal for five seasons. She has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including Seinfeld, Law & Order, Family Guy, Will & Grace and Sex and the City. Bergen is now married to New York real estate magnate and philanthropist Marshall Rose.","Candice Bergen says at 68 she is happy being fat and lives to eat .

The prince is buried with his chariot at the centre of a huge mound, 130 feet (40 metres) across, which has been dated to the 5th Century BC. The biggest find at the site was a huge wine cauldron. Standing on the handles of the cauldron, is the Greek god Acheloos.

A team from the National Archaeological Research Institute, Inrap has been excavating the site since October last year.

The pieces 'are evidence of the exchanges that happened between the Mediterranean and the Celts,' said Garcia. Inrap said burial chamber is one of the largest recorded for this period. The end of the sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries BC were characterised by the rise of Etruscan and Greek city states like Marseilles in southern France. Mediterranean merchants, seeking slaves, metals and other precious goods, opened trading channels with continental Celts. The Celts gained valuable objects of Greek and Etruscan origin as a result of the trade. Many have been found in other mounds in Heuneburg and Hochdorf in Germany.

Well you’re in luck, because a fresh mug of tea is now available at the touch of a button – from your coffee machine. Two British firms have joined forces to launch tea capsules which can be used in existing Nespresso machines. The Cornish Tea Company will provide the leaves for a revolutionary pod made by Dualit – a brand best-known for its toasters and kettles. The Cornish Tea Company (pictured) will provide the leaves for a revolutionary tea capsule made by Dualit . Coffee drinkers have long enjoyed the merits of capsules, which provide instant hot drinks from machines made by Nespresso, Krups and Nescafe. But now tea drinkers can enjoy the same benefits with Dualit pods which are filled with tea from the family-run Cornish company. The pods are also compatible with Dualit’s own range of coffee machines, but do not come cheap. A single cup of tea will cost 30p – 15 times more than a typical 2p tea bag. Duncan Bond, director of the Cornish Tea Company, said: ‘We are terrifically proud to be the first tea brand in the world to be launching a Nespresso-compatible capsule. It’s never been done before and it has tremendous global potential. ‘When tea bags were first introduced people said they’d never catch on, now they are 97 per cent of the market. This could have a similar impact.’ Mr Bond, who founded the business with his nephew in 2012, added: ‘Many of our consumers lead very busy lives and this is not only incredibly convenient – the quality of the cup of tea is absolutely, scientifically consistent every time.’ The pods were developed last year after High Court judges ruled Dualit’s coffee capsules – which can also be used in Nespresso machines – did not infringe owner Nestle’s patents. The tea capsules, made by Dualit (left) which is best known for its kettles and toasters, can be used in existing Nespresso machines (right) The decision has blown open the tea and coffee capsules market, and Dualit has invested £1million in a new factory to meet the expected demand. The company started selling its own-brand tea capsules late last year but this is the first branded tea product to be made into a capsule. Dualit's Managing Director Leslie Gort-Barten said the Cornish Tea Company, based in Looe, Cornwall, was the perfect partner for the product. 'Cornish Tea are passionate, they are enthusiastic - they are player-managers in the same sense we are,' he said.

In an interview with The Atlantic, John Sylvan, who came up with the idea for the coffee pods and the machine in the early 1990s, revealed that he 'feels bad' about the negative impact that the pods are having on the environment. Sylvan, who no longer uses the plastic pods himself, also confessed he wishes he had never created them in the first place. 'I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,' said Mr Sylvan, who sold his share of the company in 1997 for $50,000. Scroll down for video . Regrets: John Sylvan (pictured) says that he often wishes he had never invented the Keurig coffee pods . Keurig is currently thought to be one of the most popular at-home brewing systems in America. Last year the company sold 9.8 billion Keurig-brewed portion packs and earned $4.7billion. The design is simple - a small plastic capsule containing ground beans that can be put into a machine to produce a cup of coffee at the touch of a button. However despite the multi-billion pound success of the company nothing has been done to try and make the packaging of the popular Keurig pods recyclable. And Mr Sylvan insists this will never happen. 'No matter what they say about recycling, those things will never be recyclable,' he said. 'The plastic is a specialized plastic made of four different layers.' Mr Sylvan, who co-founded the company with Peter Dragone, added that the unique plastic used in the K-Cups - known as plastic #7 - is only recyclable in a small number of cities in Canada, and cannot as yet be processed yet in the United States. Unfortunately the plastic is also integral to the unique design of the pods. It ensures that the coffee inside stays completely protected from any outside elements and remains completely intact while the coffee is being brewed. The popularity of the simplistic coffee pods has also come across the shores to the UK. Adverts for K-Cup featuring the slogan 'Brew the Love', enticed American audiences. And in England thousands of customers have been lured into buying Nespresso machines following similar adverts featuring George Clooney. Nespresso is now the most prominent capsule company in the UK. The machines do not take the Keurig capsules but take similar plastic ones and Nespresso has established its own sustainability advisory board. Mr Sylvan  also confessed that despite his earlier dedication to the brand, he no longer drinks coffee made using the capsules. In 1995 he had to go to hospital with heart palpitations after testing up to 40 cups of his coffee a day. He now no longer even owns a K-Cup machine and only drinks filter coffee. George Clooney has helped popularise the Nespresso brand in the UK, a similar version of the K-Cups . Damaging: Keurig has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of K-Cups sold in 2014 alone would circle the earth 12 times if they were laid down end-to-end . Keurig has come under fire on numerous occasions from environmentalists who claim that the number of K-Cups sold in 2014 alone, and subsequently put into landfills, would circle the earth a staggering 12 times if they were laid down end-to-end. They have started a Kill The K-Cup campaign, which features a YouTube video showing the world being destroyed by the plastic coffee capsules. But despite the continued criticism, Keurig Green Mountain, the brewing system's parent company, has yet to come up with a viable solution to the problem, despite insisting that they have been trying to find an environmentally-friendly alternative since 2006. 'It's a warranted criticism,' Monique Oxender, chief sustainability officer for Keurig Green Mountain, told The Salt earlier this year. 'We're not proud of where we are right now, and we're committed to fixing it.' Alternative option: Mr Sylvan insists that he has managed to create a new design for the K-Cups which would be far more environmentally-friendly than the ones currently being used . Not according to Mr Sylvan. The entrepreneur insists that he has come up with an alternative design to his original creation which would involve relying on the same kinds of materials used for foil ketchup packets. But while Mr Sylvan is convinced that he holds the answer to Keurig's ongoing environmental concerns, he added that the company have thus far refused to trial his new design. 'I told them how to improve it, but they don't want to listen,' he added to The Atlantic. 'There's a much better way of doing it.' Ironically, Mr Sylvan's current work, running energy efficient solar energy company ZonBak, requires him to be much more mindful of the environment, which is perhaps why he is suffering from such feelings of guilt over his most infamous creation.","John Sylvan created the Keurig instant coffee system in the early 1990s .

Frayer, a professor emeritus of anthropology, was a part of the study published in the journal PLOS ONE that looks at eagle talons found in present-day Croatia. The talons are among the thousands of human remains, animal bones and tools originally excavated between 1899 and 1905 in the area by Croatian scientist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger.

After a month of rumours about a possible romance, the twosome were spotted hanging out in Whole Foods in Nashville, Tennessee earlier this week. But if 31-year-old DJ Calvin is to become the new Mr Taylor Swift then he should be aware that he might end up becoming the subject of one of her songs. Scroll down for video . Taylor and Calvin have been rumoured to have been dating for the last month and were spotted together in Nashville, Tennessee . Taylor is well known for writing about her love life, with her former boyfriends John Mayer, Harry Styles and Joe Jonas all having inspired tracks on her various albums. Taylor herself even admits that her relationships do inspire her musically. However, she's always careful not to go into specifics. She once said: 'For me, I have a really strict personal policy that I never name names. So anybody saying that a song is about a specific person is purely speculating. And they’re going to do that.' Here we look back over her previous relationships... and the songs they were thought to have inspired. Taylor dated Joe Jonas in 2008 and is thought to have written several songs about him after he dumped her over the phone . Joe Jonas . Taylor and Joe dated in 2008 and it's thought that he inspired her whole Fearless album. 'Forever and Always and 'You're Not Sorry,' were thought to have been about their messy split. Taylor previously revealed that Joe dumped her in a 27 second long phone call, but he countered her claims saying he would have spoken for longer had she not hung up on him. Joe actually wrote an open letter about the situation saying: 'For those who have expressed concern over the ’27-second’ phone call … I called to discuss feelings with the other person. 'Those feelings were obviously not well-received. I did not end the conversation. Someone else did. 'Phone calls can only last as long as the person on the other end of the line is willing to talk. A phone call can be pretty short when someone else ends the call. 'The only difference in this conversation was that I shared something the other person did not want to hear. There were later attempts at communication that had no response.' Taylor Swift broke her promise not to name and shame when she wrote her hit song Dear John about her ex John Mayer . John Mayer . Taylor wasn't exactly subtle when she wrote about fellow singer John Mayer who she dated briefly in 2009. She called the song 'Dear John' and she didn't hold back in expressing her feelings for the man who went on to date both Jennifer Aniston and Katy Perry. Some of the lyrics to the song include: 'You paint me a blue sky. And go back and turn it to rain. And I lived in your chess game. But you changed the rules everyday.' Taylor also references the fact that she was too young (at the time she was only 19) to be caught up with an older man. John, now 37, has since said that he didn't feel he deserved to have such a harsh song written about him. Telling Rolling Stone: 'It made me feel terrible, because I didn't deserve it. 'I'm pretty good at taking accountability now and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.' Taylor dated Taylor Lautner in 2009 and is thought to have written Back To December to apologise to the actor having dumped him . Taylor Lautner . Taylor and Taylor dated in 2009 and starred in the film Valentine's Day together. And the actor then became the subject of her song, 'Back To December.' In the lyrics Taylor reveals how she dumped a boyfriend - thought to be Mr Lautner - and left the roses that he'd given her to die. Taylor never actually admitted to having dated the actor however, when she was quizzed about their romance on the Ellen Show she remained particularly coy on the subject. Taylor and Jake Gyllenhaal may have looked like the perfect all American couple but in fact they split after just a few months of dating . Jake Gyllenhaal . Jake and Taylor enjoyed a four month romance at the end of 2010 going into 2011 and she wrote 'The Last Time,' about him. Taylor said of the song: '[It] is about an experience I had with someone who was kind of this unreliable guy. 'You never know when he's going to leave, you never know when he's going to come back, but he always does come back.' It is also thought that she wrote 'All Too Well,' about the actor. In the lyrics of the song she references how she left her scarf at his sisters house. When Jake and Taylor went out it was widely reported that the pair had spent time with his sibling Maggie Gyllenhaal who the popstar got on well with. Taylor dated Connor Kennedy in 2012 and speaks favourably about their relationship in Begin Again . Connor Kennedy . Taylor went out with Connor Kennedy - a descendant of the late JFK - in 2012  and it's thought she wrote the song Begin Again about him. Taylor said of the song: '[It is] when you've gotten through a really bad relationship and you finally dust yourself off.' The pair only lasted a few months with Taylor admitting just before they split that she perhaps didn't know that much about love. She said in an interview: 'I don't know how to have a normal relationship because I try to act normal, love from a normal place and live a normal life. But there is sort of an abnormal magnifying glass, like telescope lens, on everything that happens between me and anybody else. 'I don't really know that much about love, it turns out.' One of Taylor's most high profile relationships was with Harry Styles who she is thought to have written two songs about . Aubin & Willis Portland Sweater . Sold out! Shop the designer at Vestiare Collective . Visit site . This is the Taylor Swift sweater that launched a thousand imitations. Back when she was still dating 1Direction singer Harry Styles, Swift wore this Aubin & Willis Portland sweater featuring a fox, and suddenly everyone in the world was clamoring to get one. Swift is constantly setting fashion trends no matter what she's wearing. The pop star's preppy, buttoned-up style is a favorite both with her tween fans and their moms. This sweater is a perfect example of Taylor's cute and kitschy taste applied to tasteful and modest items of clothing. Of course, considering the major fox mania, this sweater has been totally sold out for awhile now, though you can snap up some similar items from the brand with a click to the left.

Given that Harry Styles and Taylor Swift actually only dated for about two and a half months she has got quite a lot of mileage out of their union. Taylor is thought to have written two songs about Harry including: 'I knew you were trouble,' from her Red album and 'Out Of The Woods,' from 1989. Out Of The Woods references the fact that the pair went on a skiing holiday during their brief romance which started in December 2012. Harry said of Taylor writing about him: 'I think we always say, when we [One Direction] wrote the album, that we write from personal experiences, so it would be hypocritical of us to be like “oh you can’t write a song. 'She’s really good so… They’re good songs. So I’m lucky in that sense.'

But flying an Ebola patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive, and everyone safe -- is complicated. Probably no one knows that better than Phoenix Air, a Georgia-based company that is the go-to for transporting Ebola victims by air. Since August, it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to Europe, the rest to the United States. ""We're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse. The bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway,"" said Dent Thompson, vice president and chief operations officer at Phoenix Air. He described the system that goes inside the company's modified Gulfstream G-III aircraft. It consists of three major elements: . Once the plane has landed and the patient has left, the whole system is sealed. The aircraft then flies to a high-security hanger in Cartersville, Georgia, where it undergoes a complete decontamination process, which can take up to 24 hours. Everything inside the liner, including the liner, is sterilized multiple times. The liner and everything in it is then removed, put in special boxes, and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed. ""We like to say it's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we're done with it,"" Thompson said. Phoenix Air began developing its system way before the current Ebola outbreak. It worked with the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases. Then, the main concerns were SARS, swine and bird flu. It took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved, and by the time the work was done, the need had sort of petered out. But Thompson said Phoenix Air held onto the system, knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again. He got a call from the State Department in July. By August, the company had completed its first Ebola flight, safely delivering Dr. Kent Brantly to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. A few days later, it brought Nancy Writebol to the same hospital for treatment. And on and on and on. Thompson said other groups are now developing systems similar to Phoenix Air's, including the U.S. government. But so far, none has flown. ""Other organizations have built systems, but we're the ones still doing it,"" he said. More than 10,000 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mostly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.","Georgia company equips plane to transport Ebola patients .

""We have to be clear about this,"" Koval said. ""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators, the public, to accept, to understand ... why deadly force had to be used."" The officer who killed Robinson, 12-year department veteran Matt Kenny, had used deadly force before, shooting and killing a man in 2007, the chief said. Kenny was exonerated of any wrongdoing and even received a commendation, the chief said, adding that the incident was ""concluded to be a suicide by cop"" situation. Robinson was shot after allegedly assaulting Kenny, who was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence, Koval said. Afterward, protesters in this university town took to the streets and converged on City Hall, chanting ""Black lives matter."" Koval called for calm, while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, after confrontations with police. Police described Robinson as African-American. ""In light of so much things that have happened not just across the country, but in our own community, it's understandable that the reaction at the scene and of some of our citizens is extremely volatile, emotional and upsetting,"" the police chief told CNN affiliate WKOW-TV. ""And we understand that. That's absolutely appropriate under these circumstances. We would urge, obviously, that everyone exercise restraint."" Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday night and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house. They talked and prayed, the chief said, but they advised him to put off visiting Robinson's mother ""based on the dynamics"" of the situation. ""I couldn't even begin to get my hands around the enormity of the loss and the tragic consequences,"" he said. ""Nineteen years old is too young."" Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, told CNN affiliate WKOW that she didn't understand what happened. ""My son has never been a violent person, never,"" she said. ""To die in such a violent way baffles me."" Irwin said Robinson served as a father figure to her other children. ""He was our caretaker and so gentle,"" she said. The incident started when authorities got a call that a black male was yelling and jumping in front of cars, Koval said. Dispatchers identified him as Robinson, according to 911 audio obtained by WKOW. A little later the dispatcher says, ""Apparently Tony hit one of his friends, um no weapons seen."" About four minutes later, the dispatcher says, ""I got another call for the same suspect at [the same address]. He tried to strangle another patron."" About 30 seconds later, an unidentified officer says, ""Shots fired, shots fired."" When Kenny went to the apartment, he heard some commotion and forced his way in, Koval said. ""Once inside the home the subject involved in this incident -- the same one allegedly out in traffic and that had battered someone -- assaulted my officer,"" Koval said. After that, according to the chief, ""The officer did draw his revolver and subsequently shot the subject."" Backup officers and others at the scene performed CPR on the young man, who later died at the hospital. Kenny suffered a blow to the head, but is being treated and will be released, Koval said. Kenny has been placed on administrative leave with pay. Koval said he's not sure what Robinson was doing at the house in the first place. ""His relationship to the home is unclear to me, although there were certainly familiar acquaintances. This was not a random place. He had hung out."" In a statement Saturday, state Attorney General Brad Schimel said he ""can only imagine the heartbreak"" of Robinson's parents and added he's ""concerned for the officer ... who, I imagine, is experiencing great trauma as well."" ""They are all in my thoughts and prayers,"" Schimel said. Under Wisconsin law, officer-involved shootings are investigated by an outside agency, in this case the Division of Criminal Investigation. Once DCI completes the investigation, the report will go to the local district attorney, Koval said. Some are demanding answers sooner rather than later. On Friday night, dozens of demonstrators came out to the area around the apartment, which police had blocked off. A group also moved toward City Hall before dispersing early Saturday. ""Who do we trust?"" some called out, prompting the response, ""No one!"" And in another refrain, they chanted, ""Black lives matter."" The protesters' sentiments were echoed online, where some adopted the #WillyStreet hashtag in reference to Williamson Street, where the shooting happened. ""Praying for Madison tonight,"" wrote one activist. ""Stand up, sit in, walk out - until u get answers. And until there are no more hashtag eulogies."" Mayor Paul Soglin spoke to the raw feelings, calling what happened ""an enormous tragedy."" ""We've got a family that's really hurting,"" Soglin said, according to WKOW. ""And we've got a city and neighborhood that's feeling pretty well hurt itself."" Some of the protesters were members of the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition that was formed last summer after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson. The group wants more reactive policing in African-American neighborhoods, said group member Brandi Grayson. She said Madison police park on street corners in African-American neighborhoods and wait for something to happen, which leads to residents being hassled. That doesn't happen in white neighborhoods, she said. She said Young, Gifted and Black will be working with church groups on Sunday and will hold more rallies Tuesday and Wednesday.

Contestants in You’re Back In the Room compete for cash prizes after being put in a trance by a hypnotist who claims to have ‘hacked’ into their minds. Keith Barry is said to have implanted ideas into volunteers’ brains – convincing them, for example, that their pants will feel tight whenever they hear a bell, or that they should push their face into a cake every time they hear certain words. Scroll down for video . Back In the Room: Phillip Schofield hosting the new show  which some experts are calling a fraud . But clinical hypnotherapists who treat conditions like anxiety claim the TV brainwashing is a nonsense – and could be exploiting ‘vulnerable’ people. ‘It is not true to say anyone can have their brain hacked,’ said qualified therapist Mark Powlett. ‘You absolutely can’t make people do things they don’t want to do. ‘People who are under hypnosis are put in a very relaxed state which makes them open to positive suggestion. But the last thing a show like this wants is people who are relaxed – as they wouldn’t be able to perform as required.’ Mr Powlett said contestants on the show, hosted by Phillip Schofield, were not under Barry’s ‘control’, but playing along willingly. ‘The people on stage want to entertain, they what to be in front of people and they want to win money,’ he said. In a trance: Experts have questioned whether contestants on new show You're Back In The Room, pictured above, are really hypnotised . Liz McElligott, chief executive of the National Hypnotherapy Society said: ‘The programme sounds sensationalist to me. It’s completely wrong to say you can make people do something they don’t want to do. ‘It would worry me if vulnerable people are playing along because they want to be on television.’ ITV selected contestants via auditions, and one who failed to get a place tweeted: ‘My conclusion is that they are looking for people who purposely carry on for the camera because it will make great TV.’ Barry, who is certified by the National Guild of Hypnotists, said: ‘There is obviously a huge difference between using hypnosis as a therapy and as entertainment. ‘All contestants were genuinely hypnotised. On many occasions they were throwing away their prize money – something they would never ordinarily do, unless of course they were hypnotised.’ ITV, which will air the four-part series from next Saturday, said; ‘Duty of care to the contestants was always of paramount importance.’ Producers also abided by the 1952 Hypnotism Act and Ofcom rules on showing the full hypnotism routine that may cause ‘adverse reactions’.","New show where public are hypnotised branded a fraud by experts .

Gilbert Drogheo, from Harlem, was rushed to hospital after being shot on the mezzanine section of the Borough Hall station at 6.30pm on Tuesday but later passed away in hospital. Two other men, Drogheo's 29-year-old friend and the retired corrections officer, who is 69, were taken into custody on Tuesday night and were being questioned on Wednesday, police said. A cell phone video obtained by CBS New York revealed the moment the officer allegedly shot and fatally wounded Drogheo. Altercation: Cell phone footage taken by a witness and shared with CBS New York shows an older man approaching a younger man at the subway station and getting into a scuffle before a shot is heard . Terrifying: A blurred figure can be seen near to where the altercation occurred on Tuesday evening . Police told the New York Times that the argument began when the ex-officer, who was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun, stepped between the two friends as they had a conversation on the train. The clash turned physical and one of the younger men spit on the ex-officer, police told the Times. Another witness told the New York Daily News he overheard one of the assailants use a racial slur in addressing the older man, telling him: 'I got you now, my n*****.' '[The older man] said, ""I'm not your n*****, I'm not your boy,”' the witness told the paper. The station PIX11 also reported that two young men were acting ‘belligerent’ on their Brooklyn bound 5 train. When the train reached the platform at Borough Station in Downtown Brooklyn, the three men separated. Emergency: Ambulances carry away an injured man; Gilbert Drogheo was pronounced dead in hospital after he was shot in the torso and the ex-corrections officer was taken away for treatment for a minor injury . Rush hour shooting: A 32-year-old man was fatally shot by a retired corrections officer during the shooting . But in footage captured by a witness and shared with CBS2, the older man can be seen walking up stairs from the platform to the mezzanine level before encountering one of the younger men. The two exchange words and the older man apparently pushes the younger man, the video shows. Just seconds later, a shot is heard. Drogheo was shot in the torso. Other images captured by witnesses and shared with NBC show a man on the ground. He was rushed to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead. The former corrections officer, who has not been named, remained at the scene and was taken by police to Long Island College Hospital for treatment. Neither man has been named and no charges have been filed but both are being questioned. Deadly confrontation: Witnesses said the fight began when the older man stepped between two men . Fight: The 69-year-old gunman was reportedly heard telling his opponents, 'don't touch me' before the brawl . Tempers flare: The 69-year-old former jail guard got on the crowded train at Bowling Green station and was trying to walk past the duo when some words were exchanged . Witnesses described the chaotic scene after hearing the gunshot ricochet through the station during one of the busiest travel times of the day. Fatima Manuel told CBS she was confused by the sound at first. 'Like a ""pow, pow"" sound,' she said. 'Sounded like a firecracker, but then I said: ""No, that's not a firecracker. That's more like a gunshot"".'. Another subway user, Donny Dushi, added: 'It's the scariest thing to even hear about. Wherever you are in the city - regardless if it’s Brooklyn, the city, Queens, just knowing the transportation you take every day, it can happen to anybody.'

Residents of the area have been warned to stay indoors with their doors and windows shut if they see smoke, with children and asthmatics in particular danger. The fire started last night at a farm near the Fairglen interchange off the A130, between Wickford and Rayleigh. Blaze: Firefighters at the scene of a tyre fire which broke out last night between Wickford and Rayleigh in Essex . Inferno: Seven fire crews have used water and foam in an effort to extinguish the enormous fire . Eruption: The fire has proved difficult to control because the tyres are packed tightly together and it is hard to get water to the core . Seven fire engines were sent to tackle the blaze, which has proved particularly tricky because the waste tyres are packed closely together making it difficult to extinguish the core of the fire. The A1245 has been closed in both directions because of smoke reducing visibility in the area and this is likely to continue for most of the day, Essex Police said. Greater Anglia train services on the line to London are not running between Southend and Wickford, and are not expected to restart until this afternoon. Inspector Scott Egerton, of Essex Police's roads policing team, said: 'There will be long delays and I would ask people to avoid the area. 'Diversions will be in place but people should check social media and Essex travel updates for the latest information. The transport network in the area could be affected for most of the day.' Flames: Local residents were told not to go outside because of the risk of smoke inhalation and other injuries . Tricky: Firefighters ended up using foam to beat back the flames, but it took longer to get to the fire burning at the core . Action: Crews battled through the night to try and extinguish the fire on a farm . Dramatic: Flames leapt up from the fire through the night and into the morning despite the best efforts of fire crews . Gary Jeffrey of Essex Fire and Rescue Service said that crews remain at the scene attempting to put out the fire. 'It is a large pile of tyres which have been tightly bound together at a waste storage site,' he said early this morning. 'Because the tyres are so densely packed and tightly bound it is proving difficult to get water on to much of the fire.' Firefighters successfully brought the flames under control with foam this morning, but they are still fighting to extinguish it completely. 'The foam attack was successful in knocking the flames back but the fire continues to burn deep within the pile,' Mr Jeffrey said. 'We are now using water to cool the pile and protect surrounding risks. 'We hope to get some heavy plant machinery in to start breaking the pile up later to give us better access to extinguish the fire.' Disruption: Train services in the area were shut down all morning, causing chaos for commuters travelling to London . At work: Firefighters next to the fire as it continued to burn this morning . Closed: The A1245 was shut in both directions as a result of the danger from smoke pouring into the air . Public Health England said in a statement that local residents should 'avoid outside areas affected by any smoke or ash'. It added: 'If people can see smoke outside their property, or can see evidence of soot particles on window sills or external surfaces, then they should stay indoors with windows and doors closed until the fire has been brought under control. 'For anyone who already has problems with their lungs, for example asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, it is advisable to stay inside while the fire is still burning, minimise infiltration of smoke by keeping windows and doors closed and to be sure to keep all necessary medicine with you.' Residents who are suffering from ill health as a result of the fire should seek medical attention.","Fire started last night at a farm just off the A130 between Wickford and Rayleigh, and was still burning this morning .

'Imagine what Iran would do with nuclear weapons,' he warned on Tuesday, saying that the Islamic republic is already training, arming and dispatching terrorists on five continents. Asked whether President Obama watched the speech, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters: 'I don’t believe that he did.' Netanyahu says a nuclear-capable Iran would have the means to achieve its stated goal of annihilating Israel. He listed a litany of instances when Israel has acted on its own, in defiance of the U.S., to protect itself. The Obama administration is pursuing talks with Tehran that critics say could ultimately allow the kind of nuclear enrichment inside Iran that Netanyahu fears most. U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power insisted on Monday in a speech preceding Netanyahu's that it will 'never' happen. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, flanked by one of his security guards, addressed the 2015 American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference in Washington on Monday . Netanyahu insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong' The backdrop for the rift between the longtime allies was the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the largest pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. On Tuesday Netanyahu will address the U.S. Congress. Despite some Democrats' boycotting, demand to see the speech is brisk. 'We’ve had 10 times the number of requests for tickets than there are seats available in the gallery,' House Speaker John Boehner said Monday in an emailed statement. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Each House member gets a single ticket to give away. 'I could scalp that ticket, there are so many people who want it,' Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg told The Washington Times. 'In fact, demand is so overwhelming that both the House and Senate have set up separate viewing locations, which are also ticketed events.' Obama has repeatedly cautioned Israel not to launch pre-emptive attacks against Tehran, but Netanyahu suggested Monday that he could choose to act unilaterally as his country has done in the past, even at the risk of alienating the United States. Sara Netanyahu, wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, attended her husband's speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee policy conference on Monday . 'In 1948, Secretary of State George Marshall opposed David Ben-Gurion's intention to declare statehood,' Netanyahu recalled. 'That's an understatement – he vehemently opposed it. But, Ben-Gurion, understanding what was at stake, went ahead and declared Israel's independence.' 'In 1967, as an Arab noose was tightening around Israel's neck, the United States warned ... that if Israel acted alone, it would be alone. But Israel did act – acted alone – to defend itself.' 'In 1981, under the leadership of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Israel destroyed a nuclear reactor at Osirak,' Netanyahu continued. 'The United States criticized Israel and suspended arms-transfers for three months. 'And in 2002, after the worst wave of Palestinian terror attacks in Israel's history, Prime Minister Sharon launched Operation Defensive Shield. The United States demanded that Israel withdraw its troops immediately but Sharon continued until the operation was completed.' 'I mention them to make a point,' he said. 'Despite occasional disagreements, the friendship between America and Israel grew stronger and stronger, decade after decade. And our friendship will weather the current disagreements as well to grow even stronger in the future.' US United Nations Ambassador Samantha Power told AIPAC that the United States will 'never' allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon . The alliance between Israel and the Unites States is 'stronger than ever,' Netanyahu finally insisted, quelling fears of a rift between his Likud Party and Obama's Democratic Party. He insisted that 'reports of the demise of the U.S.-Israel relation is not just premature; they are wrong.' 'My speech is not intended to show any disrespect to President Obama or the office that he holds. I have great respect for both,' he said. 'I deeply appreciate all the President Obama has done for Israel: Security cooperation, intelligence sharing, support in the UN and much more.' 'The last thing anyone who cares about Israel, the last thing that I would want, is for Israel to become a partisan issue,' he added, 'and I regret that some people have misperceived my visit here this week as doing that. Israel has always been a bipartisan issue. Israel should always remain a bipartisan issue.' Netanyahu addressed the gathering Monday morning at the Walter E. Williams Convention Center, bracketed by remarks from two senior U.S. officials: Power and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. The Obama administration hedged  last week about whether it would send someone to speak, and who it might be, after Daily Mail Online raised the subject during a White House briefing. Power insisted that 'The United States of America will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, period.' 'Talks, no talks, agreement, no agreement, the United States will take whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security and that of our closest allies,' she said to an audience of thousands. 'We believe diplomacy is the preferred route to secure our shared aim. But if diplomacy fails, we know the stakes of a nuclear-armed Iran as well as everyone here. We will not let it happen. There will never be a sunset on America's commitment to Israel's security. Never.' She also criticized Netanyahu for 'politicizing' the Iran debate, saying U.S.-Israeli relations 'should never be politicized and it cannot and will not be tarnished or broken.' Netanyahu's visit to Washington has sparked criticism in both the U.S. and Israel. The centerpiece of his trip is an address to Congress Tuesday, which came at the invitation of congressional Republicans and was not coordinated with the White House. HOUSE MEMBERS . Rep.

Neither President Obama nor Vice President Biden will meet with the prime minister while he's in Washington, citing a desire to avoid the appearance of picking a side in Israel's upcoming elections. A close Obama adviser, though, former presidential campaign aide Jeremy Bird, is in Israel working to help Netanyahu's opposition defeat him. Rice has been particularly sharp in her criticism of Netanyahu's plans to address Congress, calling the move 'destructive' to the fabric of the U.S.-Israel relationship. The Israeli leader is deeply suspicious of Obama's efforts to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, fearing the U.S. and its negotiating partners are prepared to leave Tehran on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon. A Netanyahu adviser told reporters traveling to Washington with the prime minister on Sunday that he was not coming to the U.S. capital to offend Obama. 'The prime minister is here to warn, in front of any stage possible, the dangers' of the agreement that may be taking shape, the adviser said, speaking anonymously under a policy that bars the official from speaking on the record. Netanyahu outlined policy differences with the White House on Monday . Pro-Palestine demonstrators wore Netanyahu masks and showed symbolic 'blood stained hands' on Sunday during protests led by Code Pink . The adviser said Israel was well aware of the details of the emerging nuclear deal and they included Western compromises that were dangerous for Israel. Still, he tried to lower tensions by saying that Israel 'does not oppose every deal' and was merely doing its best to warn the U.S. of the risks entailed in the current one. As Netanyahu was preparing to speak, Secretary of State John Kerry was in Switzerland for another round of talks with Iran. The U.S. is seeking to secure a framework agreement to curtail Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief ahead of a late-March deadline.

The Bedford County Sheriff's Office said Monday that additional leads prompted another dig on Taylor's Mountain in Bedford County, but officials didn't provide details. The operation is expected to take several days. An earlier dig was conducted on the mountain in January. The sheriff's Office, the Virginia State Police and the Montgomery Police Department in Maryland are conducting the search for the remains of ten-year-old Katherine Lyon and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon. 12-year-old Sheila Lyon (left) and ten-year-old Katharine Lyon (right) went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations . The Lyon sisters never came home after walking to the mall together in 1975. A massive search turned up nothing . The girls went missing on March 25, 1975, after walking to get some pizza at the Wheaton Plaza Shopping Center in Maryland and to look at the Easter decorations. The Lyon sisters never came home, and a massive search turned up nothing. Parents John and Mary Lyon have never been able to find out what happened to their daughters. Over four decades, police have pursued numerous leads and periodically identified potential suspects. But they never charged anyone. Authorities have, however, named Richard Allen Welch Sr. and his nephew, Lloyd Lee Welch, as persons of interest in the case. Neither man has been charged. In February it was revealed that Lloyd Lee Welch, a sex offender, told investigators that he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to  police affidavits. The Washington Post reported that Montgomery County police, citing the ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the affidavits or how credible they find 58-year-old Lloyd Welch's recent statements. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza (pictured, 1975) and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car . Though volunteers searched for the sisters, they came up with nothing. Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible . 'Our department and our partners in Virginia remain committed to determining what happened to Katherine and Sheila Lyon,' Montgomery Police Chief Tom Manger said in February. 'We believe that there are people, including family members of Dick and Lloyd Welch, who have information that would further this investigation.' Richard Welch's wife, Patricia, was charged with perjury after testifying before the grand jury in December. The affidavits released in February did not say whether any incriminating evidence has been found on Taylor's Mountain in Virginia. Investigators have found bones on a property near Taylor's mountain that used to belong to the family of Lloyd Lee Welch, according to court papers. But that may not mean much because the land contains an old cemetery with more than 30 unmarked graves. At one point during the search, detectives wrote that a dog trained to sniff decomposition 'alerted' to areas away from the cemetery. On the day they vanished, the girls' older brother reported seeing them at the mall, and a friend claimed to have seen them talking to an older man who was carrying a microphone and a briefcase. Lloyd Welch told investigators he left a Maryland shopping mall with two young sisters who disappeared in 1975 and later saw his uncle sexually assaulting one of the girls, according to police affidavits unsealed in Febrary . Authorities have been searching for the remains of 12-year-old Sheila Lyon and 10-year-old Katharine Lyon on a remote mountain in Bedford County, Virginia, some 200 miles from their Montgomery County, Maryland, home, since September . A sketch of that man, who had long hair and a mustache, was created and circulated, but it didn't lead to any arrests. One person who provided details to a police artist said the man had been 'fixated' on the girls. Welch, who worked at a traveling carnival with his then girlfriend Helen Craver, had been at the mall and was seen paying attention to the Lyon girls, police chief Thomas Manger said. The filings detail for the first time how Lloyd Welch surfaced in the case. A week after the girls vanished the then-18-year-old Welch went to Wheaton Plaza and told a security guard that he had seen the sisters leave with a man in a car. Police gave him a polygraph test which showed he was lying, according to the affidavits, which did not say whether authorities continued to look into Welch. The detectives on the case in 2013 set out to learn more about Welch, who had been arrested in 1977 in Montgomery in a burglary case. His mug shot from that arrest strongly resembled a sketch in the Lyon sisters case that had been drawn based on a witness's description of a man at Wheaton Plaza who was staring at the girls and following them, according to the affidavits. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. The girls' father, John Lyon, became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones . Police searched property in Virginia (pictured) once owned by the family of drifter and convicted child rapist Lloyd Lee Welch . In 1994, he had pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in South Carolina. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a ten-year-old girl in Delaware and was sentenced to three decades in prison. The detectives went to Delaware, according to the affidavits, and interviewed Welch several times in prison. 'During these interviews, Lloyd Welch has admitted he left Wheaton Plaza in a vehicle with the Lyon sisters on the day they disappeared,' according to the affidavits, written by Montgomery Detective Mark Janney and Detectives R.D. Baldwin and S.O. Smith of the Bedford County Sheriff's Office. The affidavits say Lloyd Welch told police Richard Welch was involved in kidnapping the girls. Lloyd Welch said he was dropped off near his home, and the next day he went to Richard Welch's home where he saw the uncle sexually abusing one of the sisters. He said he left and never saw the girls again. Shelia and Katherine were on spring break when they disappeared. They left their home at 11am and their mother Mary Lyon told them to be home by 4pm. Mrs Lyon later said that in the quiet Washington, D.C., suburb, it was common to let children go to the shopping center alone. As the Montgomery County Gazette put it years later - it was a simpler time when everyone looked out for everyone else's children. The massive investigation that followed the girls' disappearance brought in countless tips and widespread national and local media coverage. Potential clues were found, but later discounted. People were brought in for questioning, but later released without charge. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon (left) would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon (right) would be 50 years old . Detectives never found evidence of what happened to Katherine and Sheila or who was responsible. Their disappearance profoundly changed the Lyon family. Mr Lyon became a victims' advocate in Montgomery County and help counsel other families who had lost loved ones. The girls' brother, who was 15 at the time they vanished, became a homicide detective when he grew up. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Katherine Lyon was last seen wearing a baby beads necklace with orange beads and 'KATE' in black letters on white beads and dirty beige brushed suede wallaby type Jumping Jack shoes with dirty beige shoelaces. Sheila Lyon was last seen wearing farsighted gold wire rimmed glasses, low cut GallenKamp sneakers, size 6.5 or 7.5, with dirty white shoestrings, and knee socks. Katherine has a birthmark on the inside of her upper thigh. The organization also created age-progressed photographs of the sisters.

The injection of Manuel Vasquez with a lethal dose of pentobarbital leaves Texas with enough of the powerful sedative to carry out only one more execution. Vasquez was the fourth Texas inmate put to death this year, and at least six are scheduled for execution in the coming weeks. Texas prison officials, like those in other death penalty states, have found it increasingly difficult to find suppliers to provide drugs intended for capital punishment use. Scroll down for video . Put to death: Gang enforcer Manuel Vasquez, 46, was executed Wednesday for the ordered murder of a San Antonio woman who ignored a 10 per cent street tax on drugs known as a 'dime' Vasquez, 46, was pronounced dead at 6.32pm CDT, 17 minutes after the drug began being administered. Vasquez, in a final statement, told his family and friends he loved them and thanked 'the Lord for his kind mercy, faithfulness and unconditional love.' 'In Jesus' name I pray,' he said, then told the warden: 'I'm ready.' He took three deep breaths, then began snoring loudly. The snores became progressively quiet, and all movement stopped within less than a minute. The sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window. He never looked at her. His own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room. Vasquez's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra. Evidence at Vasquez's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra for ignoring the Mexican Mafia's 10 per cent street tax on drugs — known as a 'dime.' 'I'm sure she was told if you're selling, you've got to pay the tax,' said Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez. 'I guess she didn't take it seriously.' After a night of drinking and drugs at a run-down San Antonio motel, Vasquez and two companions put on bandannas on their facesbarged into the nearby room of Ybarra and her boyfriend, Moses Bazan, early on March 19, 1998, according to evidence presented at his trial. Bazan was knocked out in an ensuing struggle but said he saw Ybarra being beaten, heard Vasquez holler that she was biting him and saw Vasquez using a telephone cord to strangle Ybarra. The attackers grabbed valuables like cameras and jewelry, stuffed them into a pillowcase and fled. When Bazan regained consciousness, he stumbled to the motel office to summon police. He was able to identify at least one of the attackers, leading to the arrest of all three. One of them, Johnny Joe Cruz, took a plea deal that carried a seven-year sentence and testified against Vasquez. The third man charged, Oligario Lujan, is serving a 35-year prison term. Court records show the three were carrying out orders from Mexican Mafia boss Rene Munoz, who spent years on the Texas Department of Public Safety's 10 Most Wanted List until his arrest in 2012. Joel Perez, Vasquez's lead trial lawyer, recalled last week that the motive for the slaying was 'very detrimental'. 'We have the Texas Mexican Mafia, and anyone selling drugs they collect a dime - 10 percent,' he said. 'And the motive in this case was she wasn't paying.' Detectives also found the blood of the victims and Vasquez's blood on clothing left in the trunk of a car he used. 'It put him at the scene when he denied being around there,' Mary Green, an assistant Bexar County district attorney who prosecuted Vasquez, said. The lethal injection of Manuel Vasquez on Wednesday evening at Huntsville prison in Texas would leave T officials in the nation's most active death penalty state with enough pentobarbital to carry out only one more execution until they are able to obtain a new supply . 'I recall he was an extremely violent individual. In the punishment phase we proved up two other homicides he'd been involved with.' Vasquez had a lengthy record and had been in and out of prison at least twice. One conviction involved the beating of a man who died after his body was set on fire. Records also show Vasquez' father is serving a life sentence for a 1976 murder, and a brother and cousins are or have been in prison. Texas' next execution is scheduled for next week. Randall Mays is set to die for a 2007 shootout where two East Texas sheriff's deputies were killed. Executions set for April in the nation's most active death penalty state will require a new lethal drug supply to be carried out. Some states have started considering other options. Utah's Legislature gave final approval Tuesday night to a proposal to allow executions by firing squad if there is a drug shortage. Legislation to allow firing squads also has been introduced in Arkansas, while a Wyoming firing-squad measure failed. In Oklahoma, lawmakers are considering legislation that would allow the state to use nitrogen gas to execute inmates. 'I remain optimistic we'll be able to carry out executions according to the schedule,' Brad Livingston, executive director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, has told The Associated Press. 'Time will tell.' Vasquez' execution is the 522nd in Texas since the state reinstated capital punishment in 1976.","Manuel Vasquez, 46, was injected with lethal dose of pentobarbital for carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old Juanita Ybarra in San Antonio, Texas .

Not only did her romantic liaison take place in the front seat of her Audi, but she was also parked in the middle of a zebra crossing. And to top it all off, she left her hazard lights flashing. Faye Gregson, 26, from Preston, was arrested by police after they found her car parked at an angle on a zebra crossing on Christmas Eve while she was straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat . The 26-year-old, who was nearly twice the drink-drive limit, was arrested after police caught her straddling her boyfriend in the passenger seat. Yesterday, she was fined £300 and begged a judge not to take her licence, saying: ‘I’m really sorry. It won’t happen again.’ A court heard she had stopped in the middle of the road in Blackpool at around 2.30am on Christmas Eve before clambering on top of her boyfriend. Gregson, whose favourite books include Fifty Shades of Grey, had parked her black Audi at an angle on the crossing but put her hazard lights on to warn other drivers. The keen netball player at first denied she had been drinking and tried to get out of a breathalyser test by claiming that she had a cold, Blackpool Magistrates Court heard. But officers carried out the test anyway, describing her as ‘smelling of alcohol’ and having glazed eyes. Prosecutor Alison Quanbrough told the court they had spotted her because of her flashing hazard lights. Gregson initially denied being drunk, saying she had just finished a 15-hour shift at Preston hospital. She refused a breath test, saying she had a cold, but a urine test showed she was twice the drink-drive limit . ‘She was straddling a male in the passenger seat,’ said Mrs Quanbrough. ‘When she saw the police she got off the male. She then got into the driver’s seat and put on the seatbelt.’ Officers asked Gregson to step out of the car and found she was unsteady on her feet. But she said she had not been drinking, and claimed to have just finished a 15-hour shift at the Royal Preston Hospital, where she works. Gregson was taken to a police station where she refused to be breathalysed and was given a urine test instead. It showed she had 205 milligrammes of alcohol in her body. The maximum allowed by law is 107. Gregson, who had no previous convictions, later admitted being in charge of the car while over the limit. She apologised and pleaded with the court to let her keep her licence, saying: ‘I need my car to get to work at hospital as I work shifts.’ Magistrates agreed and instead ordered ten points to be added to her licence. Gregson, from Preston, was also told to pay £85 costs and a £30 victims’ surcharge. On her Facebook profile she lists Fifty Shades of Grey as one of her favourite books alongside What I Wish I Knew About Nursing. Pictures taken on Christmas Eve show her partying with her friends. Drivers can be prosecuted for being ‘in charge’ of a vehicle while over the alcohol limit. The offence is used when drunk people are caught either getting into or having just stopped their cars. They can be charged even if they are in the passenger seat if police think they were recently driving, as in Gregson’s case.","Police saw Faye Gregson, 26, parked on zebra crossing on Christmas Eve .

A Dutch pilot 'predicted' the Germanwings crash several weeks ago in an article written in a specialist flight magazine posing the question: 'I seriously wonder who's sitting next to me.' Chillingly Jan Cocheret, who flies a Boeing 777 for Emirates airlines warned: 'I hope I never find myself in the situation where I go to the toilet and return to find a cockpit door that won't open.' Mr Cocheret was writing for Dutch flying magazine Piloot en Vliegtuig (Pilot and Plane) where he expressed his fears. His article warned that someone could use the security procedures introduced in the aftermath of the 9/11 atrocities to prevent an aircraft's captain re-entering the flight deck after a rest break. French prosecutors have determined that Andreas Lubitz waited for his captain to leave the flight deck before disabiling key pad controlling access to the cockpit. He then selected an altitude of 96 feet on the aircraft's flight computer before setting it on its collision course with the Alps. Investigators revealed that the aircraft's captain Patrick Sondenheimer can be heard banging on the cockpit door urging his colleague to open up until the jet hits the Alps at more than 400 miles per hour. Audio leading up to the crash revealed that Captain Sondenheimer had complained that he did not have enough time to use the toilet while the aircraft was on the ground in Barcelona. As soon as the aircraft achieved its cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, Captain Sondenheimer can be heard leaving the cockpit. As soon as the door closed behind him, Lubitz flicked a switch which disabled the keypad on the cabin side of the door for five minutes and initiated his descent. The door lock override is switched off after five minutes as an additional safety measure in case the flight crew become incapacitated. Lubitz is believed to have flicked the switch a second time during the eight-minute descent. Mr Cocheret later wrote on his Facebook page: 'Unfortuantely, this terrible scenario has become a reality.' Scroll down for video . Andreas Lubitz locked his captain out of the cockpit before commanding the aircraft to crash into a mountain . Scientists are currently trying to identify the remains of the 150 people killed in the disaster using DNA . Investigators are currently trying to carve a road up to the crash site to help speed up the recovery process . His original article predicted the exact way such an atrocity could be carried out. He said: 'I seriously sometimes wonder who’s sitting next to me in the cockpit. How can I be sure that I can trust him? Perhaps something terrible has just happened in his life and he’s unable to overcome it. 'There indeed does exist a way to get back into the cockpit, but if the person inside disables this option (the security code to get in), one could do nothing but sit with the passengers and wait and see what happens.' German airline Lufthansa has set aside $300 million to deal with potential civil claims against the company following the Germanwings disaster. The French crash investigators BEA said they will look into methods of preventing a similar incident in future. A spokesperson said: '(We will study) systemic weaknesses (that) might possibly have led to this aviation disaster.' German officials have revealed that Lubitz, 27, received psychotherapy before gaining his pilot's licence after expressing suicidal tendencies. Crash investigators are trying to build a road to the site of the crash to help speed up recovery efforts and attempts to find the second black box. Lufthansa has so far refused to say whether they were aware of Lubitz's mental health history although they said he had passed all the required medical tests to work with Germanwings, its low-cost subsidiary.","Pilot Jan Cocheret wrote about his fears about cockpit suicides last month .

Single mother, Pauline, 47, from Southampton, says her daughter's behaviour can be so unpredictable she dreads outings and special occasions like birthday parties, and she feels like a victim of domestic abuse because of the daily barrage of abuse she gets at home. 'Her behaviour has deteriorated from being a normal child to attacking me on a daily basis. Very few people have seen her that way as it's behind doors,' Pauline told Channel 5 show My Violent Child. Pauline Bubb, pictured on Channel 5 show My Violent Child, has suffered physical abuse from both her son and daughter and wonders if her parenting skills are to blame . Spencer, now 11, pictured as a young boy with twin sisters Sapphire and Jorja, now nine. Spencer could be aggressive at this age as it was before he was diagnosed with ODD and ADHD . 'She can be a complete Jekyll and Hyde - one minute she's a loving child and the next she can turn, biting, pulling hair, trying to pull my earrings out, punching, kicking, trying to break things. 'She is only a tiny little thing and she goes through this thing and it scares me. I have been attacked at least 30 times in one day. It can be for any reason.' The Channel 5 show goes into their home to reveal how Sapphire can be aggressive - both physically and verbally - over the smallest of things if she doesn't get her own way. During one outburst, she is seen shouting at her mother: 'It's not f***ing working, don't f***ing talk to me' over a toy and when her mild-mannered twin sister, Jorja, tells her to 'stop being silly' she retorts: 'Shut up you b****!' Pauline is at the end of her tether as after Spencer was diagnosed, Sapphire then started acting violently. 'It feels like I am in domestic violence with my kids,' she said . In another shocking scene, she bites her mother's face during a meltdown over homework and then sobs in her arms because she's sorry for what she's done. 'I don't understand why I get angry, I hurt people and I kick them,' Sapphire said. It's not the first time Pauline has experienced physical abuse at the hands of one of her children. As previously reported by MailOnline, Pauline found raising her son, Spencer, now 11, a real challenge as he was prone to regular violent outbursts and he once stabbed her with some scissors. At the age of five, he was diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and put on anti-psychotic medication. 'Before the diagnosis he could be really violent, he stabbed me with scissors, he tried to strangle me, he could be violent punching, kicking and swearing,' Pauline recalled. Sapphire hugs her mother after regretting biting her in the face during one violent outburst filmed by the Channel 5 documentary . Spencer has calmed down thanks to his diagnosis but Pauline now faces another violent battleground with Sapphire. After the problems she experienced with Spencer when he was younger and now Sapphire, Pauline said: 'It feels like I am in domestic violence with my kids. 'They have taken the role of the abusive partner. This can't go on, I don't know how to deal with it. 'I try my hardest I put my all into everything for them and they just seem to fight me all the way.' Pauline often has to retreat her to bedroom in fear of her children's behaviour and is left in tears over what she can do to bring harmony to their home. 'I do worry that it's me, where did I go wrong? I do the best I can do at as a mum but I worry it's down to my parenting skills,' she admits. Caught in the firing line is her other daughter, Jorja, who often retreats to sit on her own when her sister's tantrums begin and is often at the receiving end of her verbal abuse herself. Trying to play a simple games of cards with her sister can result in her being sworn and shouted at. The single mother-of-three often retreats to her room to hide from her aggressive children . Islay Downey, a parenting practitioner who helped Pauline when she struggled with Spencer, returns to help the family again now Sapphire is causing problems. She said Pauline needs to establish a routine, set more ground rules and be more assertive. She advised Pauline to work on her own self-esteem as her lack of confidence in her parenting is holding her back. 'At the moment the children are on control and that's a very unsafe place for children,' she said. She observed that Jorja was often the victim as she withdraws to find a corner to sit on her own while her mother and sister fight. Islay said: 'Sapphire has learnt a pattern of behaviour that if she wants attention, this (being violent and aggressive) is the way to get it. Pauline is urged by a parenting practitioner to be more assertive and self-confident - she has let her children take too much control . 'It's like a dripping tap, little by little we have to get mum to be more assertive. Pauline needs to focus more on Jorja, that retreating isn't good for her.' The family are taken for 'intensive weekend intervention' at an outdoor activity centre in the New Forest to help them. Islay said: 'From experience, it helps to taken them away from a familiar environment where they have to break familiar patterns of behaviour.' During the weekend, the family do role play exercises where they recreate arguments taking the part of each other so they can see the situation from the other person's perspective. They also take part in survival activities in the forest and games where they have to work together. A weekend away with her twin girls proves a revelation as Pauline finally starts being the boss . The activities all work towards Pauline reestablishing control instead of letting Sapphire take charge. The mother is amazed by the transformation in her children's behaviour when she is the boss. She said: 'When I have made a suggestion they haven't kicked off and have listen to what I have said which is a good thing. Now I'm in my element, I'm really happy. 'The one thing I will take home is positivity, their behaviour has been amazing.' Islay says she's hopeful Pauline 'will now go from strength to strength' and take what she had learnt back into the home environment.

The truck driver, 59-year-old Richard Clayton of Wisconsin, wasn't injured, Trooper Josh Lewis said. James Saunders of the state patrol told The Durango Herald that neither alcohol nor speeding was a factor in the crash. Images of the scene also show that it was not snowing or raining at the time. 'The fact that they were wearing seat belts is why they are with us today,' he said. The area of the highway was shut for more than two hours following the crash.

In a genetic first, scientists have sequenced the largest ever set of human genomes from a single population. The epic undertaking involved sequencing the DNA of 2,636 Icelanders and comparing them with the partial sequences of another 104,000 revealing insights into human evolution . Scientists see Iceland as a goldmine for doing genetics research. The country was founded by a small group of settlers from Europe arriving about 1,100 years ago and it remained isolated for the next thousand years. Because the population in Iceland has very little genetic diversity, scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily. Iceland also has strong genealogical record, as a result of well-preserved historical documents. This date range, based on a calculation of human mutation rates, contradicts earlier findings that claim the father of all humans lived around 340,000 years ago. Scientists now estimate his age to be 239,000 years old – a date closer to humanity's most common female ancestor who is believed to have lived 200,000 years ago. As well as evolutionary insights, scientists say the dataset will help them discover 'mutant genes' that naturally protect a rare group of people from certain diseases. So far, the work has provided promising results helping identify 20 million genetic variants among the Icelandic population. Among these variations, scientists at Reykjavik-based DeCode Genetics have already found genes that increase the risks of Alzheimer's disease, liver and thyroid problems. 'This work is a demonstration of the unique power sequencing gives us,' said Kari Stefansson, founder of DeCode, who led the research. 'This is very much more than a molecular national selfie,' he added. 'We're contributing to important tools for making more accurate diagnostics for rare diseases.' Stefansson's team today published four papers online in Nature Genetics, all of which used the Icelandic data. Among several key finds, the data set suggests that the 'father of humanity'  would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago. This date range, based on a calculation of human mutation rates (pictured), contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago . They detail mutations in the ABCA7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Six of the eight mutations in ABCA7 were also found to be present in other populations of European ancestry, including the US, indicating that the results are not specific to the Icelandic population. They also identify a variant of the gene ABCB4 that is significantly associated with the risk of developing liver disease. Gilian McVean, a geneticist at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the study told New York Times that discovering a rare association this way 'is a bit of a holy grail' for geneticists. 'Large scale whole-genome sequencing of the Icelandic population' This study demonstrates how DeCode is able to use national genealogies to infer rare genetic mutations throughout the population. 'Identification of a large set of rare complete human knockouts' The scale and detail of the data was used to identify more than a thousand knocked out genes in the population. The study found nearly eight per cent of the 104,000 people studied having at least one gene that don't work. 'The Y-chromosome point mutation rate in humans' The data set suggests that the 'father of humanity' - our most recent common male ancestor - would have lived between 174,000 and 321,000 years ago. This date range, based on a calculation of human mutation rates, contradicts earlier findings that claims the father of all humans live around 340,000 years ago . 'Loss-of-function variants in ABCA7 confer risk of Alzheimer's disease' This study details mutations in the ABCA7 gene that are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Six of the eight mutations in ABCA7 were also found to be present in other populations of European ancestry, including the US, indicating that the results are not specific to the Icelandic population. A separate study reveals that 8,000 Icelanders – around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that doesn't function at all. The most common genes that were muted were those associated with a person's sense of smell, and overall, the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced. The scientists now intend to recall those Icelanders with knock-out genes as part of a new study to try to identify any physical differences or diseases that have caused the silenced genes. The work was funded by Amgen, a California-based biotechnology company that paid $415 million for Reykjavik, Iceland-based DeCode two years ago. It is now basing its research projects against DeCode's database to make sure its medications are aimed at the right people. But some experts are wary of the results. They say the Icelandic population has a unusual demographic history because the country is isolated, with only around 320,000 inhabitants. A separate study reveals that 8,000 Icelanders – around 7.7 per cent of the population - have a least one gene of their 21,000 genes that doesn't function at all.  Overall, the researchers found 1,171 different genes that had been silenced . Andrew Allen, a geneticist at Duke University who didn't take part in the studies told The Verge said this means that the 'sample studied is not exactly healthy, is somewhat opportunistic, and probably doesn't correspond to any 'real' population.' But Stefansson says that the results should still be representative of people in other areas because the Icelandic population doesn't meet any of the requirements for interbreeding. The scientists are now trying to decide whether they will provide the study participants with information their genetic risk for various diseases. Stefansson's own view is that 'it would be a crime' not to let them know. Scientists see Iceland as a goldmine for doing genetics research. The country was founded by a small group of settlers from Europe arriving about 1,100 years ago and it remained isolated for the next thousand years. Because the population in Iceland has very little genetic diversity, scientists can find genetic variants that raise the chance of disease more easily. Iceland also has strong genealogical record, as a result of well-preserved historical documents. Stefansson says look at the genetics databases from the top down, rather than from the bottom up, could result in some breakthroughs in medicine. 'I'm 100 percent sure that we will find more protective mutations,' he told Bloomberg news. 'I'm absolutely convinced these protective mutations are going to be important when it comes to pointing us toward good drug targets.'

England’s head coach will name a preliminary training squad of around 45 players in the middle of that month, before the semi-finals of the Aviva Premiership. Clubs such as Northampton, Saracens and Bath — who provide large contingents to the national squad — are bound to be involved in those blood-and-thunder matches and there is a significant risk of untimely injuries as the league campaign reaches its anticipated explosive climax. Stuart Lancaster will name his 45-man preliminary World Cup squad before the Premiership semi-finals . Lancaster must then reduce his squad to 31 players by for the World Cup on August 31 . England will have a final World Cup warm up match against Ireland at Twickenham . A day after the Premiership final at Twickenham on May 30, an England XV made up of emerging rookies will face the Barbarians at HQ. The senior players will reconvene to begin their summer training camp in Surrey on June 22, and the two weeks from July 13 will be spent at altitude in Denver — Colorado’s ‘Mile-High City’. A week off upon their return from the States will be followed by a return to camp as England prepare for one experimental encounter with France at home, followed by a return fixture in Paris which they intend to treat as a more full-on Test. Lancaster must announce his final World Cup squad of 31 on August 31, before a final warm-up match, against Ireland at Twickenham. Explaining the schedule of events as the tournament countdown intensifies, Lancaster said: ‘The training camp will start on June 22 and the wider squad will be about 45. It will be announced mid-May, before the Barbarians game, which is the same weekend as the Premiership final. ‘The side to play the Barbarians will probably be made up of younger players. No-one in the squad will play in that, though one or two who have had injuries might come back into the equation. ‘From a selection point of view, we will use the first warm-up match to look at wider options. As you narrow down to the second game, the World Cup squad and the Ireland game, they will be proper games then.’ However, England will not wait for their encounters with France and Ireland to assess their players’ credentials in match conditions. The plan is to host in-house matches of their own. Lancaster explained: ‘We’ll spend a lot of time with proper 15-on-15 games internally anyway. ‘We’ll make sure the players are put under that sort of Test-match pressure. England will also play France twice in the build up to the 2015 World Cup . Courtney Lawes was cited for his challenge on Jules Bisson but no further action will be taken . Lancaster's side beat France 55-35 in the Six Nations on Saturday but did not secure the title . ‘We have two high-quality teams now and you can replicate the intensity on training alone. They will vary in intensity as we go through June and July. ‘When we go to Denver, we were thinking of bringing in opposition, but actually we’re probably better off having a bash against each other.’ One man who certainly ‘had a bash’ against France on Saturday was Courtney Lawes.

The American world No 1, who made a nervous start before battling past Romania's Monica Niculescu 7-5 7-5 in her opening match, was back to business as usual with a 6-2 6-0 demolition of Kazakhstan's Zarina Diyas. 'I was able to relax because I was able to do more of the right things and not make as many mistakes as I did in my last round,' said Williams, who boycotted the Indian Wells event for 14 years after winning the 2001 final. Serena Williams made short work of Zarina Diyas, winning 6-2, 6-0 to reach the Indian Wells fourth round . Diyas, of Kazakhstan, had little answer to the play of world No 1 Williams . 'I think with that, that helped me to be able to relax even more. It definitely felt back to normal out there. Just trying to feel the rhythm and trying to focus on the ball more than anything else.' Williams, a 19-times grand slam singles champion, had been apprehensive and 'a little nervous' after finally deciding to return to Indian Wells after such a long time away. Fourteen years ago, she was booed by the crowd as she beat Kim Clijsters in the final to win her second title at the California desert resort, where her father Richard Williams alleged he had heard racist taunts. The heckling by the crowd was in apparent response to Serena's sister Venus having withdrawn from their semi-final that year just minutes before the match, citing injury. Williams believes that, despite an impressive performance against Diyas, there is more to come . Diyas hits a forehand as she tried in vain to get a foothold in the match against Williams . Williams said she felt more relaxed and back to normal against Diyas than she did against Monica Niculescu . Williams and Diyas congratulate each other at the net after the match came to a swift end . On Friday, however, Serena received a standing ovation before the start of her match against Niculescu, an experience she described as 'amazing'. Asked what her father and sister Venus had said to her after her opening match, Serena replied: 'They just said, 'Good job.' They were both really proud. 'The standing ovation was amazing. I really felt excited by it. I think it's been a really great learning experience for everyone involved. Williams was overwhelmed by the reception she got from crowd on her return to Indian Wells after 14 years . Williams was given a standing ovation during her game against Niculescu on Friday . 'It was what it was, but I have kind of like really tried to zone into tournament mode and tournament focus. That's what I'm just trying to get ready for the rest of the event.' Against the outclassed Diyas, Williams looked every inch a world No 1, though she felt she still had some way to go before she reached her optimum tournament level. 'I feel like I can do a lot better in terms of just being mentally prepared and mentally ready,' said the 33-year-old. 'That's what I'm just going to try to do ... is just keep going.'

Now, however, scientists have revealed what's considered 'normal' for penis size and length. The average length of an erect penis is 5.2 inches (13.12 cm), they found. Meanwhile, the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm) and 5.2 inches (13.24 cm) when flaccid but stretched. And when it comes to girth, the average erect circumference was 4.6 inches (11.66 cm) and 3.7 inches (9.31 cm) when flaccid. The British research also found there was a small correlation between the erect length of a penis and a man's height. The average length of a flaccid penis is 3.6 inches (9.16 cm) and 5.2 inches (13.24 cm) when flaccid but stretched, the researchers found (file photo) The researchers say the graphs they have plotted, which show the size distributions of a penis, will help clinicians dealing with Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), a serious anxiety disorder relating to body image. The study could help to counsel men worried about their size, or with investigations into how condom failure relates to penis size and girth. Some men are concerned about their penis size, and those who are preoccupied and severely distressed may even be diagnosed with BDD. The researchers created a graph (or a nomogram) depicting the size distributions of penis' among men of all ages and many races. The research included 17 studies of 15,521 men who underwent penis size measurements by health professionals using a standard procedure. Before this research, there had been no formal systematic reviews of these measurements, and no attempt to create a nomogram showing the distribution of size. Lead author Dr David Veale from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, told MailOnline: 'Men compare themselves in locker rooms and with pornography on the internet and believe they are inferior. 'Some men have been teased by sexual partners about their length. 'There are lots of men who might be worried - and we think reassuring men they are in the normal range will help. 'We will also use the graphs to examine the discrepancy between what a man believes to be their position on the graph and their actual position, or what they think they should be. 'We have a specialist Body Dysmophic Clinic and some men are very worried and distressed about their size. Experts plotted graphs showing the size distribution of the length of the average penis when flaccid, flaccid and stretched and erect. The graph above shows average penis length of men - in centimetres - in each percentile . The researchers also plotted a nomogram showing the size distribution of the girth of the average penis. The graph shows the average penis girth of men in each percentile - again in centimetres . 'They are unlikely to be helped just by looking at a size distribution graph, they will need more formal treatment like Cognitive Behaviourhal Therapy or medication too.' Dr Martin Baggaley, medical director at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'BDD causes a person to have a distorted view of how they look and they can spend an obsessive amount of time worrying about their appearance. 'This can include worries over their weight, specific parts of their body and, for men, the size of their penis. 'This can take over someone's life and cause a great deal of distress. 'Hopefully this new study will help reassure those many men who are concerned with their penis size and assist clinicians dealing with BDD.' 'BDD occurs alongside Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and a person with BDD may constantly compare their looks to other people's, spend a long time in front of the mirror or avoid the mirror altogether, constantly conceal a perceived defect or feel anxious when around other people or in social situations.'

Rauner hit out at New Jersey, which has had Christie as governor since 2010, during a speech at the Illinois Farm Bureau last week. Sniping: Bruce Rauner, right, has said that New Jersey, the state run by his ally Chris Christie, left, is 'a disaster' because of its tax regime .

The State Register-Journal of Springfield, Illinois, reported that he continued: 'New Jersey is lost. They're going down the drain, and they ain't turning it around.' The staunch criticism may come as a surprise to Christie, who as the head of the Republican Governors Association funneled $7million in campaign funds to help him topple Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn. Christie often showed up on the campaign trail alongside Rauner, and boasted that he 'didn't come empty-handed' after making a $2.5million top-up to the coffers.

And it is a problem that even afflicts Downton Abbey as the producers prepare to shoot what will be the sixth – and final – season. So popular have its stars become that they are cashing in on 'the Downton Factor' to take up lucrative film and television jobs in America. The majority of the cast have spent the past few months auditioning in Hollywood, and a source said: 'Everyone connected with the show knows that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.' One LA producer said: 'I've had more than one agent for the stars of Downton coming on to me asking what is available. 'They've all been in town, trying to get their faces out there, trying to cash in on that goodwill and grab work while they can. 'The Downton Factor has become something of a joke in LA. You can't turn around at a dinner table without seeing another face from the series. 'Of course, most of the Downton cast are classically or theatre-trained, so there's no question that they can act.

Congratulations to Joanne Froggatt who won a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Anna Bates in Downton Abbey. She was one of many British stars in attendance and along with Eddie Redmayne and Ruth Wilson she'll be bringing a little statue back to the UK. And it's not just her acting that deserves recognition. Joanne has been rocking some seriously gorgeous looks recently. We've spotted her in an Emilia Wickstead playsuit, an Ermanno Scervino two-piece and a Stella McCartney dress. And for her moment in the spotlight she opted for this lovely embellished dress by Marchesa.

The White House says Obama will visit Kenya in July for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit, which brings together business leaders, international organizations and governments. Obama has visited Kenya three times in the past, including once as a U.S. senator, but never as president. Scroll down for video . Then a senator, Barack Obama is pictured here in Kenya in 2006 with Maasai 'mamas.' Basecamp Masai Mara in Mara National Reserve in Kenya is a Scandinavian initiative that aims to develop a partnership with the native Masai people. Obama will visit the country again in July, the White House announced today - his first visit to Kenya since becoming president in 2009 . Obama is pictured here during a 1988 trip at his family home in the Kenyan homestead of Alego. From L to R are Barack Obama, Grandmother Sarah,  Auma Obama (Barack's half sister) and Kezia Obama (Barack's stepmother) In this August 25, 2006  photo Senator Obama is greated by an enthusistic crowd in Nairobi. During the long-promised visit this July, Obama will attend a Global Entrepreneurship Summit in the east African nation . During a trip to other African countries last year, he said he was likely to visit Kenya before leaving the White House. The president's father came to the United States from Kenya for school, where he met Obama's mother Ann Dunham. The couple divorced when the younger Obama was two years old and Barack Obama, Sr. returned to his home country. The elder Barack Obama died more than 30 years ago, though the president has other family still living in Kenya. A controversy during his 2008 campaign for president, and again, albeit to a lesser extent, in his 2012 bid for re-election, was a rumor that Barack Obama the younger was not born in Hawaii as stated and was instead born in Kenya. The charge stems, in part, from a 'fact-checking error' a literary agent made in materials promoting Obama in 1991. The booklet, produced by agency Acton & Dystel stated that Obama was 'born in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.' The editor of the text, Miriam Goderich, took credit for the mistake in 2012, telling Yahoo News, 'There was never any information given to us by Obama in any of his correspondence or other communications suggesting in any way that he was born in Kenya and not Hawaii.' The president's father, also named Barack Obama, is a Kenyan native. According to the younger Obama's memoir Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama Sr. met his mother Ann Dunham while attending college in Hawaii. The couple divorced after three years of marriage in 1964, and the president saw his father just one more time after that before his death in a car accident in 1982. The president's first known trip to Kenya, as detailed in his book, was in 1988, when he spent five weeks there. He returned to Kenya in 1992 with Michelle, then his fiance, and again  in 2006 during his first year in the U.S. Senate. The White House said today that Obama would visit Kenya in July for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit - his first trip to his father's homeland since he was elected to higher office in 2008. Some 'birthers' as they are known as continue to believe that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, however, and is therefore ineligible to be president based on constitutional requirements for the office. His first known trip to the country was in 1988, when he spent five weeks there, according to his memoir Dreams from My Father. He returned to Kenya in 1992 with Michelle, then his fiance, and his half sister Auma, and again  in 2006 during his first year in the U.S. Senate. It was not immediately clear whether the president would be accompanied on the July trip by his wife and daughters. The White House would not say on Monday whether Obama would visit with family while in town, either. It made no mention of Obama's personal ties with the country in its announcement but did point out that he has visited sub-Saharan Africa more than any other sitting president. 'Just as President Kennedy’s historic visit to Ireland in 1963 celebrated the connections between Irish-Americans and their forefathers, President Obama’s trip will honor the strong historical ties between the United States and Kenya – and all of Africa – from the millions of Americans who trace their ancestry to the African continent, to the more than 100,000 Americans that live in or visit Kenya each year,' it said in a blog post. Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, last year visited Washington at the invitation of Obama as part of the White House's first-ever Africa Leaders Summit. Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu predicted Monday that Obama's trip to Kenya would likely gin up 'hard right' Republicans who still think he was born in the African country. He also suggested that with dwindling time to travel on the government's dime, Obama is more concerned about seeing the world than the United States' national security. 'He’s going to take advantage of the last two years and go to all the places he wants to go,' Sununu said, according to Politico. Making mention of the ongoing nuclear negotiations with Iran and the instability in Yemen, Sununu told Fox News, 'I hope the president is paying attention there and doing more focus on that than making travel plans.'","Obama will visit in July for the Global Entrepreneurship Summit .

But while many, in the UK especially, had to contend with clouds, plenty of images captured the event – and an odd black spot on the sun. While it might have looked like a speck of dust at first, this was actually a sunspot on the solar surface, caused by a concentration of magnetic fields. Scroll down for video . People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning. But several observers spotted some strange black dots on the sun (shown). These were sunspots, caused by concentrations of magnetic fields. They are sometimes associated with eruptions such as solar flares . Sunspots are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings. They range hugely in size, from just 10 miles (16km) to 100,000 miles (160,000km) - big enough to be seen from Earth without a telescope, and more than ten times the size of our planet. Sunspots are regions where powerful magnetic fields emanate from the sun . These magnetic fields can get wound up so tightly that they rise up from inside the Sun, and the sunspots mark the points where this happens. They are much colder than the rest of the sun's surface and usually last a few days before disappearing. They have a temperature of anywhere from 2,700 to 4,200°C (4,890 to 7,590°F), compared to 5,500°C (9,930°F) for the surrounding solar material, which is why they are so visible. Sunspots are also sometimes the source of eruptions on the sun, namely solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), all of which are linked to magnetic fields. The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. Sunspots should not be confused with coronal holes, regions of the corona - an aura of plasma around the sun - where the magnetic field reaches out into space rather than looping back down onto the surface. Sunspots (previous Nasa image shown) are fairly common, with the number on the surface correlating with how active the sun is. They occur when a concentration of magnetic fields causes the surface temperature to reduce, making a specific section stand out from the surroundings . Some observers took to Twitter to express their views on the sunspots, which were spotted in live footage showing the moon passing across the face of the sun . Others bemoaned the cloud coverage in the UK, which meant that many observers were unable to actually see the event at all. There were more than 10,000 mentions of the eclipse per minute on Twitter, according to social media monitoring company Brandwatch . The sun goes through a periodic change in activity known as a solar cycle, which has an average duration of 11 years, which also changes the frequency of sunspots. In this Nasa image, multiple sunspots can be seen across the solar surface . This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness. Astronomer Gemma Lavender from All About Space magazine explains: . 'When a solar eclipse occurs, what you’re witnessing is Earth, moon and the sun aligning. 'Eclipses can only really happen at a new moon. With this in mind, it’s quite easy to think that we should get an eclipse every month but because the moon’s orbit around  Earth is tilted by around five degrees to that of our planet’s, our natural satellite’s shadow usually misses the Earth’s surface by passing above or below it. 'It’s only really at least twice a year that the geometry lines up just right to make an eclipse for observers in a particular part of the world. 'The sun is roughly 400 times bigger than the moon but it is also around 400 times further away from us. As a result, the sun and the moon have the same size in the sky to make a partial or total eclipse. 'There are two types of eclipse - a partial and a total. During a partial solar eclipse, only some of the sun’s surface gets blocked out by our lunar companion. 'With a total eclipse, all of the Sun’s surface gets covered by the moon, creating a shadow that is projected onto  Earth. Day turns into darkness for a few minutes for observers in this shadow. 'However, when the moon passes in front of the sun, we don’t always get a total eclipse. 'Instead, we get an annular eclipse, also known as a ‘ring of fire’ - that’s when the Moon is at a further distance from the Earth in its orbit and therefore appears smaller, unable to cover the Sun’s disc entirely. 'At a distance of around 220,000 miles (357,000 kilometres) on 20 March though, the sun’s disc was sufficiently covered.' Britain's skies began to darken at around 8.24am this morning as the moon started to move between us and the sun, with the eclipse peaking at around 9.30am across the country. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. In the Hebrides the sun was practically invisible as the Isle of Lewis experienced a 98 per cent eclipse, while the Faroe Islands saw a total eclipse. But cloud coverage meant that millions across Britain were unable to see anything at all of the eclipse, the like of which will not be seen again for several more decades. The last solar eclipse of such significance occurred on August 11 1999, and was 'total' - with 100 per cent of the sun covered when seen from Cornwall. Another 'deep' partial eclipse visible in the UK will not occur until August 12 2026, and the next total eclipse not until September 2090. Today's eclipse produced a 100-mile-wide 'totality' shadow path that crossed the North Atlantic and covers only two land masses, the Faroe Islands between Scotland and Iceland and the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. Away from this path the sun was partly obscured. A partial eclipse was visible across a large part of the northern hemisphere, including the whole of Europe, Greenland, Newfoundland, northern Africa and western Asia. More than 100 people flocked to the 5,000-year-old Callanish Stones on the Isle of Lewis to witness the solar eclipse. And they were rewarded most of the time by a break in the clouds - almost to the point of near totality. Lewis had been billed as the prime place in Britain to see the solar phenomenon. Caroline Pritchard, 58, and her partner Laurence McCallum, 50, travelled 905 miles in a 21 hour car and ferry journey - together with their three dogs - to see the event. This morning, millions across Britain stopped to watch the country's first solar eclipse this century, which plunged parts of the UK in to brief darkness . 'This is the end of the age of Aquarius and we wanted to get here to see the eclipse,' said Mr McCallum, who works in a fine food business. 'I took the week off work unpaid and it has been worth it. It was fantastic. We arrived on Tuesday and unfortunately missed the other great astronomical event here this week - the Northern Lights. But the eclipse more than made up for it.' Ms Pritchard agreed: 'I am a spiritual person and I was drawn here to see the eclipse. I believe in powers greater than ourselves.' Islander Linda Vaughan, 62, from Crossbost, rang a Tibetan bowl to herald the eclipse as it created dusk - with temperatures noticeably plunging with the sun's infra red blocked out. 'The sound resonates with the stones. This is a spiritual and sacred place.. It is about creating the right harmony,' she said. The sun's light was almost totally concealed, casting a huge shadow of the moon across the nation turning day briefly to night, but watchers could not look directly at the sun because they risked damaging their eyes. Instead, solar eclipse glasses (shown) helped people observe the event . Four intrepid shadow seekers even boarded a special boat trip with Kilda Cruises from Leverburgh on the Isle of Harris at 5am to witness the eclipse at remote St Kilda. The archipelago, 41 miles (66km) west of the main Outer Hebrides, was forecast to be cloud free at the time of the event. Donny Mackay, president of the Stornoway Astronomical Society, said it received over 500 inquiries by email - as well as 100 phone calls - from all over the UK as well as far away as Germany. 'I was a bit worried when I saw the cloud early this morning but it turned out as good as we could have hoped for. It was really memorable,' he said.","People in the UK were treated to a partial solar eclipse this morning .

If Theresa May’s intention was to upstage Angelica Rivera, Mexico’s rather beautiful First Lady, then she succeeded — though unfortunately not for the right reasons. Rather, the Home Secretary looked a disturbing mix of one part dominatrix and one part Fifties housewife, with those gloves that put me in mind of a pair of Marigolds. Home Sexetary!Sporting S&M thigh boots, miniskirt and red and gold bobble coat this week, May goes into fashion meltdown on her way to meet the Queen and the President of Mexico . At 58, what May appears to be suffering from is a classic 50s fashion crisis. Having been there, I know the form this crisis takes. What happens is this. One day you survey yourself in the mirror and decide you’re looking like a middle-aged frump and that if you don’t watch out you’ll soon be morphing, before your time, into a little old lady. Your wardrobe is in a rut. You buy the same boring basics for weekends and the same smart suits or skirts and tops for work, year in year out. So, in an effort to update yourself, you rush out and start buying things that will make you feel fresher, flirtier, more youthful. Unless you have teenage children to put you in your fashion place (and May doesn’t have children), you may find yourself with a whole new wardrobe that just doesn’t chime with your looks, age or, in May’s case, profession. Husbands, being husbands, tend not to notice these things. Girlfriends don’t want to upset or undermine you, so they generally keep schtum. In May’s case, the trajectory was slightly different because it appears that for one brief year in her early 50s she did hit her fashion stride with a wardrobe of flatteringly cut separates in a stylish palette of navy, white, black and taupe. It’s not known whether she feared they made her invisible, however, but what’s certain is that since 2010 her style has been characterised by eccentric and flamboyant outfits. Her look has certainly changed over the years. In the early days after her election to Parliament in 1997, and the years from 2002 when she served in the Shadow Cabinet, her style evolved from ill-fitting suits in drab colours to garish: think of the voluminous orange mac she wore to the Tory conference in 2009. But once the Tories came into power and she was promoted to Home Secretary, she seemed to embark on a brief transformation after losing weight and finding her fashion feet. Shortly after, though, the crisis set in and has been growing worse, culminating in this week’s sartorial disaster. While her fetish for S&M style boots — she also wore them in 2013 for the South Korean president’s state visit — is Fifty Shades of Embarrassing, I can empathise. When my marriage broke up in my mid-50s, I bought a pair of similar boots in suede rather than patent or PVC, but after catching my reflection one day in a shop window, I thought: ‘Who am I trying to kid?’ Admittedly, my 50s fashion panic was partly about attracting men in the wake of my divorce, which is not an issue for the happily married May. But it reflects a loss of fashion confidence at this stage of our lives when the shops are full of temptations that look great on hangers and 25-year-olds, but not necessarily on us. The big difference between May and rest of us, of course, is that her fashion faux pas have to be played out in the full glare of the camera. If you play it safe, as the Duchess of Cambridge does, you get criticised for being bland. Go too trendy and you will be mocked for trying too hard. Perhaps, when it comes to fashion, May should take a leaf out of Sam Cam’s book. The Prime Minister’s wife always looks elegant and low-key, while promoting British fashion to an international audience. Theresa May is an attractive woman and has shapely and slender legs that are amazing for a woman of any age, but if when you think of the Home Secretary the first thing that springs to mind is her footwear and snazzy coats rather than her policies, she’s getting something wrong.

The same, of course, could be said of Manchester United. It is, we should remind ourselves, only the start of March. Given United’s enduring financial capacity, it should not be too long before the most successful club of the Premier League era are competing with Manchester City and Chelsea at the top of the table once more. (Left to right) Marcos Rojo, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Michael Carrick warm-up during training on Sunday .

Manchester United duo Antonio Valencia and Daley Blind are both expected to start against Arsenal . United duo Jones (left) and Falcao (right) will be hoping to start against Arsene Wenger's side . As for Arsenal, it is more difficult to say. Arsene Wenger’s team have been a peripheral concern for quite a while now. Whatever the case, on Monday night at Old Trafford, these great modern rivals come together with something more at stake than a place in the last four of the FA Cup. With United not involved in Europe this season and Arsenal staring at likely Champions League expulsion in Monaco next week — they trail 3-1 after the last-16 home leg — victory tonight would at least keep one of them relevant from a domestic point of view. No wonder United staff have been encouraging supporters to bring flags and banners to Old Trafford in a bid to bolster tonight’s atmosphere. This may not be a cup final but it may feel a little bit like one. ‘United and Arsenal are placed third and fourth in the Premier League so it’s almost like a final, I think,’ said United manager Louis van Gaal. ‘It is a big event with two good teams. I hope we can give a fantastic match for the fans. United boss Louis van Gaal is targeting his first piece of silverware since arriving at Old Trafford last summer . Wayne Rooney during United's training session at Carrington on Sunday ahead of the game . ‘I think if we beat them it is a big blow for them but if they beat us it is a big blow for us. It is a very important game, not only for the FA Cup but also for the rest of the season.’ United have not won the FA Cup for 11 years. Arsenal are the holders after last season’s victory over Hull but, prior to that, their previous success in the competition had come back in 2005. This says much for the manner in which both clubs’ focus has been elsewhere for so long. Arsenal and United have always valued the FA Cup but, during the years they disputed the league title and had grand aspirations in Europe, it was occasionally allowed to slide down the priority list. That is no longer the case. Van Gaal in particular has been respectful towards the game’s most famous cup competition ever since he arrived in Manchester last summer and has made no attempt to hide what it would mean to him — and his club — if United could win it. The first trophy Van Gaal ever won as a coach was Holland’s KNVB Cup with Ajax in 1993. He still considers his first Dutch championship, which arrived a year later, as the most important trophy of his coaching career. But he admitted he understood Jose Mourinho’s view that his most crucial success in England was his first — the 2005 League Cup triumph. Francis Coquelin evads the challenge for Aaron Ramsey during Arsenal's Sunday training session at Colney . Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck gets through some speed work at his side's St Albans base . Ramsey strides forward during the Gunners' last field session before facing United on Monday night . The Gunners squad are put through their paces as they look to reach Wembley for the third time in two years . Laurent Koscielny puts in the effort with a sprint as Wengers' team got ready for the vital game at Old Trafford . ‘You can say you play for your profession but that is not enough,’ said Van Gaal. ‘You want to win something. That is why you play and coach. The players want to win something and also the manager and also the fans. ‘When you win a title like the FA Cup, which in England is very important, and when you fight for something and you get it, you are pleased and that is why Jose Mourinho is saying what he says about his first one. ‘When you compare coaches with one another then titles are very important. And when a player wins something, they then have the experience of winning a final so there are a lot of positive things.’ Van Gaal was not hired last summer to win the FA Cup. He knows he must get United back into the Champions League. No Premier League club with aspirations of winning the league can afford to be locked out of money-spinning European competition for more than the odd season. Similarly, Wenger knows what his true responsibilities are. French centre forward Olivier Giroud is finally looking capable of scoring consistently for the Gunners . On Monday night, however, the expectation is that this should feel like the most important night of these teams’ seasons so far and the contest should benefit from that. Arsenal have been playing reasonably well for some time and have won 10 of their last 11 domestic games. With their French centre forward Olivier Giroud finally looking capable of scoring consistently, the holders will head north knowing they have the capacity to trouble their great rivals. They also have a league defeat from early winter to avenge. Arsene Wenger's side are current FA Cup champions after their dramatic victory against Hull last season . United’s football, on the other hand, has been more patchy but Van Gaal will hope that inspiration can be taken from an away win at Newcastle last Wednesday that had an important feel about it. He will also hope his captain Wayne Rooney can use his own rather sketchy FA Cup past as a motivating factor. ‘He has not won the FA Cup,’ said Van Gaal. ‘And that is something that is missing for him. ‘My first championship with Ajax was very important for me, it was also an emotional thing. It will be the same for Wayne.’","Manchester United face Arsenal in the FA Cup sixth-round on Monday .
