If Shaunda's statement 3 is true, then Fidel's statement 4 saying Shaunda lies is false.

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn.

Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game.

- Yes
- No",Yes,"A typical person would likely answer ""Yes"" to this question. The common belief is that if Alex rolling a 12 and the spinner landing on green were the conditions necessary for him to win the game, then those events directly led to his victory. This is known as the post hoc fallacy, where people believe that if one event happens before another, it must have caused it. However, in this scenario, Alex could have won the game even if he hadn't rolled a 12, as long as the spinner landed on green.

Since there are no objects mentioned that are brown in color other than the mauve teddy bear, we can infer that all other objects are non-brown.

Looking at the arranged objects, there is only the orange notebook to the right of the mauve teddy bear. As the orange notebook is a non-brown object, it means there is only one non-brown object to the right of the mauve teddy bear.

- Option (A) ""tzhe hope"": This option seems like a simple switch of the first two letters, which could be seen as a lighthearted or playful twist on the original name.
- Option (B) ""the hogpe"": This option involves changing the 'p' to a 'g' and an additional 'o' in the middle. While it deviates quite a bit from the original name, it introduces a different and unexpected element that could be interpreted as a humorous modification.
- Option (C) ""the hodpe"": Here, the 'p' is replaced with a 'd,' which seems like a plausible error someone might make when trying to type or pronounce the original name. This could be perceived as a comical alteration.
- Option (D) ""the hose"": This option appears to be a complete change from the original name. If chosen deliberately as a humorous edit, it could be interpreted as a funny play on words, making it a possible humorous variation.

Considering the given options, option (A) ""tzhe hope"" seems to be the most likely humorous edit of the original name. It maintains the essence of the original while introducing a subtle twist that could be amusing to some people.

1. Bernita tells the truth
2. Audrie says Bernita lies
3. Delfina says Audrie tells the truth
4. Vina says Delfina lies
5. Sal says Vina tells the truth

Starting from Bernita who tells the truth, let's evaluate each person's statement one by one to determine if Sal tells the truth:
- Audrie says Bernita lies, which contradicts the given fact that Bernita tells the truth. So, Audrie is lying.
- Since Audrie is lying that Bernita lies, that means Bernita indeed tells the truth.
- Delfina says Audrie tells the truth, but since Audrie is lying, Delfina's statement is false.
- Vina says Delfina lies, which turns out to be true as we have identified Delfina's lie earlier.
- Sal says Vina tells the truth. Based on our analysis, Vina does tell the truth, and hence Sal also tells the truth.

Therefore, Sal tells the truth.

The following argument pertains to this question: First of all, everyone who is a close friend of Glenna is a close friend of Tamara, too. Next, whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Glenna. Hence, whoever is none of this: a half-sister of Deborah or workmate of Nila, is a close friend of Tamara.""
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid",valid,"Let's break down the argument into its premises and conclusion:

Premises:
1. Everyone who is a close friend of Glenna is a close friend of Tamara.
2. Whoever is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila is a close friend of Glenna.
3. Conclusively, whoever is none of the above (neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila) is a close friend of Tamara.

Conclusion: 
Therefore, whoever is none of the above (neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila) is a close friend of Tamara.

To determine the deductive validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Let's analyze:

From premise 1: If A is a close friend of Glenna, then A is a close friend of Tamara.
From premise 2: If A is neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila, then A is a close friend of Glenna.
From premise 3: If A is none of the above (neither a half-sister of Deborah nor a workmate of Nila), then A is a close friend of Tamara.

Given these premises, the conclusion follows logically. If A is not a half-sister of Deborah or a workmate of Nila, then from premise 2, A is a close friend of Glenna, and thus from premise 1, A is also a close friend of Tamara. Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.

(B) I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a life threatening issue",(B),"To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the content of the statements. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what one means in an exaggerated or ironic way to convey contempt or humor. 

Looking at the statements:
(A) ""I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a server threatening issue""
(B) ""I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a life threatening issue""

Both statements express a lack of concern about emails piling up to the point of causing an issue. However, when comparing the level of exaggerated consequence in the statements, statement (B) stands out as more extreme. It exaggerates the situation from being a server threatening issue in statement (A) to becoming a life-threatening issue. This extreme escalation in consequences is more likely to be interpreted as sarcastic.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is:
(B) I'm just going to leave it to endlessly pile up until my email count goes off the screen and then it becomes a life threatening issue

Moreover, every rare consumer of KMS shampoo is not a loyal buyer of Schwarzkopf shampoo or not an owner of a Lush soap. It follows that every owner of a Nag Champa soap is an owner of a Lush soap and a loyal buyer of Schwarzkopf shampoo.""
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid",invalid,"To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and conclusions presented.

Premises:
1. Being an owner of a Nag Champa soap is sufficient for being a rare consumer of KMS shampoo.
2. Every rare consumer of KMS shampoo is not a loyal buyer of Schwarzkopf shampoo or not an owner of a Lush soap.

Conclusions (Inferred from the premises):
1. Every owner of a Nag Champa soap is an owner of a Lush soap.
2. Every owner of a Nag Champa soap is a loyal buyer of Schwarzkopf shampoo.

Let's now analyze whether the conclusions logically follow from the given premises:

1- The first conclusion (Every owner of a Nag Champa soap is an owner of a Lush soap) logically follows from premise 1 (as it is specified that Nag Champa soap owners are rare consumers of KMS shampoo, which directly links them to Lush soap owners as per premise 2).

2- The second conclusion (Every owner of a Nag Champa soap is a loyal buyer of Schwarzkopf shampoo) also logically follows from the premises. Since rare consumers of KMS shampoo are not loyal buyers of Schwarzkopf shampoo or Lush soap, and Nag Champa soap owners are rare consumers of KMS shampoo, they must be loyal buyers of Schwarzkopf shampoo.

Therefore, the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, is deduced to be valid.

(D) sheepless in seattle",(D),"Given the original artist or movie name ""sleepless in seattle,"" we need to identify the humorous edit from the provided options. To find the correct answer, we should closely examine each option compared to the original name.

Option (A) ""sleepless in settle"" has a simple transposition of the last two letters in ""seattle,"" changing it to ""settle."" This option seems to maintain the playful nature of the original name.

Option (B) ""sleeplekss in seattle"" has multiple errors. Not only are the letters rearranged in ""sleeplekss,"" but the transposed ""k"" and ""s"" do not seem to be intentional or make it humorous in relation to the original name.

Option (C) ""sleepless in peattle"" retains the correct starting word but replaces ""seattle"" with ""peattle."" This change seems to be a straightforward replacement without adding any humor.

Option (D) ""sheepless in seattle"" replaces the first letter of ""sleepless"" with ""h"" to create the word ""sheepless."" This change introduces a playful twist, turning ""sleepless"" into ""sheepless,"" which could be considered a humorous edit.

Therefore, the option that is a humorous edit of the artist or movie name ""sleepless in seattle"" is:
(D) sheepless in seattle

1. Being a cousin of Jana is necessary for being a workmate of Leonor.
2. Every cousin of Jana is a daughter of Tracy or a sister of Sara.

From premise 1:
- If someone is a workmate of Leonor, they must be a cousin of Jana.

Options:
(A) thee longest day
(B) the bongest day
(C) the longest eay
(D) the longest eday",(B),"Given the original artist or movie name ""the longest day"", to create a humorous edit, we need to make a playful alteration to the name that maintains the general sound and structure of the original name. Let's assess the options provided:

(A) thee longest day - This option simply adds an extra ""e"" in the beginning which does not significantly alter the pronunciation or humor of the original name.
(B) the bongest day - This option replaces ""longest"" with ""bongest"", which is a humorous alteration as ""bongest"" is not a real word and sounds similar to ""longest"".
(C) the longest eay - This option slightly alters the spelling of ""day"" to ""eay"" which doesn't seem to contribute to the humor intended.
(D) the longest eday - This option adds an ""e"" before ""day"", creating ""eday"" which slightly changes the original word but doesn't seem to enhance the humor.

Considering the above analysis, option (B) the bongest day appears to be the most likely humorous edit of the original name ""the longest day.""

Now let's break down the adjectives in the sentence options:
- (A) awful little triangular paper motorcycle: opinion (awful), size (little), shape (triangular), material (paper)
- (B) triangular awful paper little motorcycle: shape (triangular), opinion (awful), material (paper), size (little)

Options:
(A) One failed test 6 years ago is simply insufficient proof of her cheating in last night's fight
(B) One failed test 6 years ago is simply devastating proof of her cheating in last night's fight",(B),"To determine which statement is sarcastic, we need to analyze the tone and intention behind each statement in relation to the context provided.

Statement A: ""One failed test 6 years ago is simply insufficient proof of her cheating in last night's fight""
- This statement downplays the significance of a failed test from several years ago as being inadequate evidence to accuse someone of cheating in a recent fight. The use of ""simply insufficient proof"" in a seemingly dismissive manner suggests sarcasm.

Statement B: ""One failed test 6 years ago is simply devastating proof of her cheating in last night's fight""
- This statement, in contrast to the previous one, emphasizes the impact of a failed test from the past as unquestionable evidence of cheating in a recent fight. The use of ""simply devastating proof"" implies strong belief in the damning nature of the evidence without room for doubt.

After carefully considering the context and the tone of each statement:
- Statement A employs sarcasm by belittling the relevance of the past event to the current situation and undermining the seriousness of the accusation.
- Statement B lacks a sarcastic tone and instead adopts a serious and definitive stance on the proof provided by the past event.

Therefore, the sarcastic statement is:
(A) One failed test 6 years ago is simply insufficient proof of her cheating in last night's fight

Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: ""I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule! I bought and used the chemical A X200R but Benni must have used something else because he did not know about the new rule."" Benni tells Tom that Alex had not told him that they were only supposed to use A X200R. He explains: ""I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!"" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?
Options:
- Yes
- No",No,"To determine whether the fertilization by Alex caused the plant to dry out, we need to analyze the situation logically:

1. Tom instructed Alex and Benni to only use the chemical A X200R for fertilization.
2. Alex mistakenly forgot to inform Benni about the new instruction and used A X200R himself.
3. Benni, not being aware of the instruction, used the fertilizer B Y33R in addition to Alex's use of A X200R.
4. The plants that dried up were the ones where both A X200R and B Y33R were applied due to Benni using the wrong fertilizer.

Given these points, we can conclude the following:
- The plants that received both A X200R and B Y33R dried up.
- Alex followed the instruction and applied A X200R.
- Benni, unknowingly, used the incorrect fertilizer, B Y33R, causing the issue.

Therefore, the drying of the plants was not caused by Alex's fertilization but by Benni's unintentional use of the wrong fertilizer. Hence, the correct answer is:

Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid

Premises:
1. Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Nobility.
2. Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core.
3. Every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is neither an ingredient of Cover Pink, Core nor an ingredient of Nobility.

Conclusion:
Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry.

To assess the validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Based on the premises provided:
- Since Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Nobility (Premise 1) and Cover Pink, Core (Premise 2), it can be inferred that Propylene oxide is also not an ingredient of any ingredient common to these two products.
- The third premise states that every ingredient of Charged Up Cherry is not in Nobility or Cover Pink, Core. This includes Propylene oxide.

Therefore, based on the premises provided and the logical deductions made, the conclusion that Propylene oxide is not an ingredient of Charged Up Cherry logically follows. Hence, the argument is deductively valid.

Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is green, so he is supposed to drive across the bridge immediately. Suzy's signal is green, so she is also supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of collapse. If either of them drives their train onto the bridge, it will collapse. Either train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge. Billy follows his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge collapses. Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse?
Options:
- Yes
- No",Yes,"The typical person would most likely say **Yes**.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The question relies on determining if Billy caused the bridge to collapse.
2. Billy followed his signal to drive his train onto the bridge.
3. Suzy also followed her signal to drive her train onto the bridge.
4. When both trains moved onto the bridge at the same time, it collapsed.
5. Both trains were heavy enough to break the bridge on their own.
6. Therefore, even if Suzy had not followed her signal, Billy's train was heavy enough to cause the bridge to collapse on its own.
7. Since Billy's action of driving his train onto the bridge immediately resulted in the bridge's collapse, causing this chain of events to occur, it can be concluded that **Billy did cause the bridge to collapse**.

The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap. Moreover, nobody is neither a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap. Finally, every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo. We may conclude: Being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap.""
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid",invalid,"To determine the deductive validity of the argument, we need to analyze if the conclusion logically follows from the provided premises.

Let's break down the premises and see if they lead us to the conclusion:
1. Nobody is neither a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.
This means those who consume Bath & Body Works soap are not occasional purchasers of Clearly Natural soap.

2. Nobody is neither a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo nor an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.
This implies that those who are rare consumers of Nioxin shampoo do not purchase Clearly Natural soap occasionally.

3. Every occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.
This suggests that anyone who purchases Kirk's soap occasionally must either frequently consume Bath & Body Works soap or be a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.

From the premises, we can conclude that:
- Being a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap excludes being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.
- Being a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo excludes being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap.
- The only way to be an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap is by being a frequent consumer of Bath & Body Works soap or a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo.

Given these conclusions derived from the premises, we see that the final conclusion that being an occasional purchaser of Clearly Natural soap is necessary for being an occasional purchaser of Kirk's soap logically follows the premises.

Therefore, the argument is deductively valid.

- ""not False"" is true, because negating false gives true.
- Therefore, ""not not False"" is false, as double negation cancels out.
- Next, ""not not not False"" is true, because the negation of false is true, and double negation doesn't change it.
- Finally, ""not not not False"" is true, as negating true gives false.

2. So, ""not not False and not not not False"" simplifies to ""false and true"".

From statement 2, Mel finished above Dan. Combining this with statement 1 (Ada finished above Mel), we get the order: Ada > Mel > Dan.

From statement 3, Joe finished below Dan. Combining this with the previous information, the order so far is Ada > Mel > Dan > Joe.

Since Ada finished second, Rob must be the one left, completing the order as follows:
1. Ada

False or True evaluates to True, because the ""or"" operator only requires one of the operands to be True for the entire statement to be True.

2. Evaluate ""not False"":
not False evaluates to True, because the ""not"" operator flips the truth value of False to True.

True and True is True, following the basic logic rule for the ""and"" operator that requires both operands to be True for the entire statement to be True.

- Elizabeth was seen playing tennis at the tennis court from 4pm to 8pm.

Next, every workmate of Regina is both a classmate of Georgia and a workmate of Carole. Plus,being an ancestor of Geraldine is necessary for not being a workmate of Carole. Therefore, everyone who is a workmate of Regina is an ancestor of Geraldine, too.""
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid",invalid,"Let's break down the premises and conclusions provided in the argument to determine its deductive validity:

Premises:
1. Nobody is neither a classmate of Georgia nor an ancestor of Geraldine.
2. Every workmate of Regina is both a classmate of Georgia and a workmate of Carole.
3. Being an ancestor of Geraldine is necessary for not being a workmate of Carole.

Conclusion:
Therefore, everyone who is a workmate of Regina is an ancestor of Geraldine, too.

To assess the validity of the argument, we need to consider if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises without any possibility of contradiction. Let's analyze each step logically:

1. The first premise states that nobody is neither a classmate of Georgia nor an ancestor of Geraldine. This implies that everyone is either a classmate of Georgia, an ancestor of Geraldine, or both.

2. The second premise says that every workmate of Regina is both a classmate of Georgia and a workmate of Carole. This means that being a workmate of Regina has a double requirement: being a classmate of Georgia and a workmate of Carole.

3. The third premise states that being an ancestor of Geraldine is necessary for not being a workmate of Carole. This indicates an exclusion relationship between being an ancestor of Geraldine and being a workmate of Carole.

Now, let's evaluate the conclusion based on the premises:

- The conclusion states that everyone who is a workmate of Regina is an ancestor of Geraldine. This conclusion follows logically from the premises because being a workmate of Regina requires being a classmate of Georgia and a workmate of Carole. Additionally, not being a workmate of Carole necessitates being an ancestor of Geraldine. Therefore, anyone who fulfills the conditions of being a workmate of Regina also becomes an ancestor of Geraldine.

Based on the provided premises and the derived conclusion, the argument is **valid**.
