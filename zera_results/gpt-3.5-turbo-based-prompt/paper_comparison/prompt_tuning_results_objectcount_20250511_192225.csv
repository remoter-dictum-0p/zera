- TASK_HINTS:
  - Explicitly list each distinct object type with its correct numerical quantity before summing.
  - Carefully verify all listed objects to avoid accidentally leaving items out.
  - Correctly classify items and avoid including irrelevant or misplaced items in your count.
  - Clearly separate the final numerical answer from your explicit enumeration and reasoning.
  - Do not label the final numerical answer; present it plainly on its own line.
  - Avoid conversational phrases or unnecessary details; keep the reasoning concise, numeric, and clear.
