Options:
(A) 60 cm  
(B) 70 cm  
(C) 65 cm  
(D) 50 cm  
(E) 55 cm  

Reasoning:
Bernard (80 cm) is removed from consideration. Remaining penguins' heights:
- Louis: 50 cm  
- Vincent: 60 cm  
- Gwen: 70 cm  

Summing the heights: 50 + 60 + 70 = 180 cm

Question:
Below is a table with information about penguins, with the first row serving as the header:

Louis, 7, 50, 11  
Bernard, 5, 80, 13  
Vincent, 9, 60, 11

Options:
(A) 60 cm  
(B) 70 cm  
(C) 65 cm  
(D) 50 cm

Reasoning:
Bernard (80 cm) is removed from consideration. Remaining penguins' heights:
- Louis: 50 cm  
- Vincent: 60 cm  
- Gwen: 70 cm  

Summing the heights: 50 + 60 + 70 = 180 cm

Louis, 7, 50, 11  
Bernard, 5, 80, 13

Options:
(A) 60 cm  
(B) 70 cm  
(C) 65 cm

When numeric computations or categorical comparisons are required, succinctly document each calculation or comparison explicitly (e.g., ""9 + 8 = 17""). Avoid unnecessary repetition of presented information, but ensure your reasoning is complete and clear.

After explicitly demonstrating your step-by-step reasoning process, provide only your final selected answer clearly as a single uppercase letter enclosed in parentheses on its own separate line at the end (e.g., ""(C)"").

TASK_HINTS:
- Explicitly identify and carefully integrate all modifications indicated in the question, such as added or deleted entries.
- Always state numeric calculation or categorical comparison steps succinctly and transparently.
- Avoid introducing assumptions or extraneous data; clearly base reasoning only on supported provided information.
- Ensure your final choice precisely matches one of the given multiple-choice letter options.
- Clearly separate reasoning analysis from your final formatted answer, ensuring the final answer line consists exclusively of the chosen letter enclosed in parentheses.

FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES:
Example:
Question:
Below is a table with information about penguins, with the first row serving as the header:
name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)  
Louis, 7, 50, 11  
Bernard, 5, 80, 13  
Vincent, 9, 60, 11  
Gwen, 8, 70, 15  

After removing Bernard from the table, what is the average height of the remaining penguins?
Options:
(A) 60 cm  
(B) 70 cm  
(C) 65 cm  
(D) 50 cm  
(E) 55 cm  

Reasoning:
Bernard (80 cm) is removed from consideration. Remaining penguins' heights:
- Louis: 50 cm  
- Vincent: 60 cm  
- Gwen: 70 cm  

Summing the heights: 50 + 60 + 70 = 180 cm  
Calculating average height: 180 cm / 3 penguins = 60 cm  

The average height matches option (A).
