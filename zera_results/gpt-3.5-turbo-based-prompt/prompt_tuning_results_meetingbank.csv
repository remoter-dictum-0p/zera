Report from Public Works, Park Recreation and Marine Recommendation to award a contract to General Consolidated Constructors for the One Apparel and Granada Beach concession renovation and site improvement project for a total contract amount not to exceed three 3,311,379 District three. Thank you. We're going to have a staff report on this. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. We're excited to be here tonight to talk about some of the continuing improvements along our beachfront. These are funded, of course, out of tidelands dollars and not general fund dollars. But we have about a million people a year that walk up and down our beachfront. It's amazing how much activity there is. And there's been a focused effort kind of assisted by Councilmember Price and Councilmember Pierce to really focus on some of the community amenities. And so I hope you've been noticing that over the last couple of years, and this really is kind of the next big step. So with that, I will turn it over to Eric Lopez and Joshua Hickman to go through a presentation. Right. Good evening, Mayor and city council. Happy to be here tonight. So before you tonight is really a holistic effort to activate the waterfront. And we have a multi-phased approach over a number of different locations. You can see the four outlined here on the screen, and each location includes both concession improvements or improvements to the building as well as play features. So over on the bay shore side of the beach, we've already made some improvements to the concession building itself, shown in the image on the left as well as play features out in the water. Alamitos Beach concession project on the east side of the beach or west side of the beach is under construction now. This is a site plan drawing of the Alamitos Beach concession and the improvements that are happening here. So you can see a play area, a retail restroom, as well as the cafe itself. This is an image showing the playground that is being installed at the Almeida's location. You can see there's a number of different play features that that are being included in that construction that's underway now. At the Gina Paris location. There's a number of different improvements that are again happening in a phased type of approach. Previously, the beach pedestrian path as well as the bike path were constructed as well as the the parking lot that you can see here. And most recently, the basketball courts and the fitness station as well as the multi-sport court have already been have already been constructed south of the beach path. You can see the concession building and the new playground, which are part of the contract that that we're hoping to award tonight. This is an image of the completed fitness station as well as the basketball and pickleball courts. And this is an image of the the new building facade, including the wayfinding signage, the better access to the facility and new shade structure for the for the for the concession area. Another image of the same facility shown looking north from the beach. This is a play area that's being installed adjacent to the Junipero location. So you can see a fairly large play structure with a slide as well as different climbing areas. Another image of the same play area. At the Granada location. There's also a number of improvements that are taking place. We have the concession building that's receiving similar treatment to the June opera. We have the water play feature highlighted in blue on the screen, as well as a fitness station and a dog rental station. So you can see there's a similar theme among all of the concession areas. So we have wayfinding signage as well as improved access, as well as some shading and some facade treatment. You can see a rendering of the Granada play area or the water play feature. It includes a meandering path as well as water that flows and allows the folks that are playing with it to interact with the water. These are some examples of how children would interact with the water. You would pump the water up into various slides and have it come and flow down through the the meandering path. And then we also have a collaborative effort with other city colleagues that we're working to really get some new beach concessionaire into each of these locations. So that is currently underway. We're working with Lee and Associates to to select those those vendors which will be coming back to you at a future at a future meeting. So the next steps would like to award the construction contract will then get started on the play. Features at both the Junipero and Granada location will then be coming back to City Council for Future Concessionaire agreements and then they would complete their their tenant improvement projects. And that concludes the presentation. We're available for any questions or comments. Thank you. There's a motion and a second counsel on price. Thank you. I want to thank staff for this. Josh Heckman and Eric Lopez have really led this effort. So thank you, gentlemen, for your great work on this. And I want to thank my colleague, Councilmember Pearce. There are three concession stands in total that have been the subject of a lot of attention from us over the last couple of years. And of course, Alamitos is a little bit ahead, and I'm really looking forward to what the changes there are going to be. I want to Paro is a shared space really between the second and third district. It kind of borders our two districts. And then Granada is in the third. And for those who don't know, it's really close to Rosie's Dog Beach, which is going to be great to have the dog walkers station and have that water element there. Really looking forward to seeing these changes. I wasn't surprised, but I think I was I was happy to get reaffirmation on the number of people that are visiting the beach since we put the beach path in, the fact that we can count how many people are out there now is amazing. For those of us who go out there on a regular basis, it's really a great sight to see. No matter what time of day or night. You go out there, you see people of all different walks of life enjoying the beach and the open space and it's really great to see. So this will be a nice amenity to add there. And I think a lot of people don't know that the basketball courts are already there at one to Paro. And so hopefully people will go out there and use those more so that we can give a little bit of relief to other impacted courts like the one at Bay Shore. But I want to thank you guys for your great work and for bringing this project forward. All three of these beach concession stands together are going to provide a really great new amenity for beachgoers. So thank you. Thank you. Got some repairs? Yes, I too. Thank you guys so much for the work that you guys have done on this. It's really been three years in the making. When I first got in office, we started doing the visioning work and I actually want to make sure that the record shows because the item says District three, but two of them are in District two. So just make sure that the you know, we have some pride over there. But with that said, we know that all of these concession stands are really used by a lot of people throughout the city, not just in our districts. Anytime I'm out there, I'll see constituents that don't live in my district that have taken the bus or taken their bike down there to really enjoy the beach path. So congratulations on that. I know I've talked to a couple of local restauranteurs and I know it's kind of a challenge now that we put the local spin on it and trying to get one of our local businesses in these concession stands. Can you share with me the timeline one on the completion of Alamitos and then two, the timeline for the RFP process? Because I know it's it's kind of been tough. Sure. So the Alamitos Construction Project is again a multiphase type approach where we have a core and shell project that's underway now and we're anticipating being complete with that fall of 2020. And subsequent to that, we'll have a tenant improvement project. So we're hoping to select in the upcoming months a future concessionaire for that for that facility. And then they will go through with their own tenant improvement project after we're complete. And are we looking at one tenant for Alamitos or two? So it's still an open discussion as to who the tenant will be there. We envision that there will be a tenant there for both retail as well as a cafe. Okay. I just ask because I had talked to a local brewery last week and they had said that they had been approached about just operating the top. And so I was just curious to that process. But I trust you guys. I think all the projects have been great. Thank goodness. On the Pickleball court, when I first said Pickleball, I never thought we would get a pickleball court there. My constituents are very happy. So thank you. Thank you. I just want to just add, because I've been a I've been a huge supporter of these projects for for many years. I'm very excited at the work that's being done, the quality, just what it's going to do for activation on the beach. They're also part of our kind of master Olympic plan to ensure that when the Olympics are here, folks are at a fully activated beach. And I think I want to particularly what I also think. Mr. Modica, I think, Tom, you have been our leading advocate for these projects in the city, and we've been working on these for a long time. And I just want to thank you and the team. I think obviously the whole Tidelands team and and the teams that's been working on it has been really great. But I just want to thank you guys. And also just to piggyback on something Councilmember Pearce said, I think it's really important that we. Ensure that we have quality service providers as it relates to food and beverage on these on these sites. And so I hope that as you proceed with the RFP process, that if you feel that we're not getting an adequate response, don't hesitate to come back. If you feel you need to change the parameters of whatever we have set within those. Because I also heard that maybe that that maybe the RFP process was a little limiting. I'm not sure if that's been the case or not, but if it has, I would much rather get a home run at with these are these are home run sites that deserve home, home run food and beverage. And so Mr. Maurer could give any comment on that. Yes. Thank you, Mayor. Those are those are great comments. We absolutely agree. We did do an original RFP and it actually didn't produce what we thought it would produce. So we changed courses. We brought on a broker, a local broker who's been really helping us. But we appreciate the flexibility. So we agree it may take a little bit longer to find the right mix, but we really deserve to have amazing concessions that are unique and fun. So we appreciate the leadership of the entire council. We've had a number of discussions with District two, District three and the mayor about how our beaches need to be really special. So we feel we're on that path and really appreciate the comments and the work of the team. Thank you. And let me and then the final thing I'll say and I'll turn to Councilman Mongo is and I think Councilmember Ranga will understand this. I'm going to put my former coastal commissioner hat on. And I think that one of the things that I really like about this project, and it's the reason why I supported the the walking and bike path that we put out. A lot of these projects oftentimes get opposition and there is opposition on these projects from folks that want to preserve as much of the beach as possible in its current form. And I think what people oftentimes forget is if we really want to create access to the beach and access to open space, you need to provide the types of services and the types of amenities at these public spaces that will get folks actually come. And I think what we have seen with the example of the the additional path, which was a as we remember opposed and these new amenities, including the basketball courts that I see activated almost every single time that I'm on the path. I see, you know, young, young people playing basketball on those new courts. That, to me, is what the true mission of access to the coast is all about, which is bringing people to enjoy this beautiful coastline. And so I'm really grateful that you guys have worked so hard on doing this and creating these spaces on the beach for people to enjoy and for all families to enjoy, not just in a passive way, but also in a way that keeps our young kids active. So thank you very much for that. Councilman Mongeau. I just want to agree and thank all that worked on a recent concession RFP that came out for the fifth District. And I think that. While the number of. Applicants was small, they were mighty. And I think that echoing the comments about the home run are really important. And then just to consider and I know we're very fortunate, the fifth District procurement proposals were all local. And I think that local hire and local business expansion is a huge opportunity that also should get additional weight because they're. Proven. To be within the liking of the community. So when you look at that and the vision of the facilities, I'm really excited for what's possible. Thank you. There's a motion and a second. I don't have any public comment in front of me. Right. So please cast your votes.","Recommendation to adopt Plans and Specifications Nos.

Councilors Edwards and Bullock offer the following petition for a special law regarding an act relative to Boston and non criminal disposition of fine. Thank you. The chair now recognizes the District Council from East Boston Councilor Lydia Edwards. The floor is yours. Thank you very much. I think every single one of my colleagues have heard it before. There's an abandoned building. The there's a absentee landlord. There's all of these things happening. They're not taking care of their property. It's become either a blight or an annoyance or things from that property is impacting them. What are you doing about it? And I goes out there and gives them ticket after ticket after ticket and still nothing changes. What we're finding and what I found in East Boston many times is that people just pay those tickets and they just pay them and move on and leave the blight there. And for us to all be frustrated or some of us to actually clean it up for them unless someone gets hurt. And that's the only time that people have come in and been forced to deal with it, at least in East Boston with a lot of. The issue that we are dealing with is that if punishment doesn't do anything, if the fines aren't impacting them, then we need to do something about the fines. And the way this works is we have to do a home repetition. Now, this is a formal petition that would that would allow for the city of Boston to consider a fine increase, up to $3,000 per violation. Currently, it's $300. And oftentimes, again, if you're a rich developer and you have or you're just waiting for someone to purchase your property, that's cheap. So I'm hoping that you will support me and say we again, Boston need to take control of this conversation and we as Boston, if you decide what is the appropriate sweet spot to encourage or force or demand of developers or whoever who refuses to take care of their property to, well, take care of their property, what's that sweet spot? So that's what this whole competition will do. I look forward to a robust conversation about that. Again, a lot of this is just bringing some of the local municipal concerns and issues in the hands of the people who have to deal with them every day. Thank you. Thank you. Senator Edwards. The chair now recognizes the district councilor from Beacon Hill. Councilor Bach, the floor is yours. Thank you so much, Mr. President. And thank you to Councilor Edwards for her leadership of partnership on this. As she stated, this would give Boston the authority to increase municipal fines from $300 to $3000. And I think that that current low limit, as Councilor Edwards says, it really encourages certain actors to just blow off the municipal fine . And and, you know, and we've all heard the frustration from our constituents. You know, many of these bad actors will go as far as to sort of just incorporate a certain number of fines into their financial planning and wait until it's actually until it can be judged to be profitable for them to make changes and fixes some things instead of improving conditions for Boston tenants and neighbors. And I just think that, you know, it's really important in a city where, frankly, there are larger and larger capital holders, right? Like you've got things that maybe it used to be that the property on the street was owned by an actual person. Now it gets swept up into some real estate trust. It's anonymous. It's hard to track. The reality is, the bigger those entities are, the more this low level fine means that it's just not meaningful to them. So this home rule petition would only raise that ceiling. It wouldn't, in fact raise any fines. In order for us to actually raise any municipal fines, there would be to be deliberation by this body and an amendment of an actual existing city ordinance. This is about asking the state to give us the permission to to raise certain fines to that level in order to better get the attention of some of these larger capital holders. And I think for quality of life in the city and being able to really induce people to change behavior when it's affecting a whole neighborhood, it's an important tweak. So I look forward to discussing it with colleagues and residents in a hearing. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Buck. I think before I can concentrate and the chair recognizes Councilor Edwards, the floor is yours. Thank you. I completely forgot to excuse me. I had unfortunately forgot to add Councilor Braden as a third party to ask to waive Rule 12 in order to add Council President as a third co-sponsor. My Councilor Edwards and Councilor Box seek suspension of the rules and the addition of Councilor Braden as original co-sponsor. Seeing no objection, she is hereby added and Councilor of the District Council from Brighton is hereby recognized. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you. Countries Edwards and Box for including me in this as an original co-sponsor, the current maximum fine of $300, which the city imposes for violations of ordinances, bylaws, rules and regulations is applied regardless of the size of the offender, whether they are an individual, a property or business owner, or a large corporate corporation. The current scale of fines may be significant enough to deter individuals from committing repeat offenses, but the current capital fines leaves big time chronic offenders undeterred from racking up and accumulating fines, rather than taking tangible action to remedy the violations to begin with, it's almost seen as the cost of doing business in Boston . We must level the playing field between individual residents who may be one off offenders and the larger scale repeat offenders who chronically take advantage of the system. This proposal is. Crucial in that it would not increase current $300 fines. It would it would not increase current $300 fines to 3000 for allow the city through our body and public council hearings the ability to propose and consider specific increases in the future. This is an important and crucial step towards a more equitable system where we can better hold chronic offenders accountable to paying their fair share and leveling the playing field for all in our city. Thank you. Thank you. Councilor Braden. The chair now recognizes the District Council from South Boston. Councilor Flynn, the floor is yours. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you to Councilor Edwards and our colleagues for the important work on this proposal. I had a discussion earlier with Councilor Edwards, and one issue that we've been dealing in South Boston and other locations around around the city of and partnering with the council clarity is the house parties that continue to take place throughout our neighborhood. And we want to see about increase in the fines so residents can sleep at night because these parties continue until 3:00 in the morning. So it's about quality of life, as is Councilor Balkan counsel Braden said. So maybe we can partner with Councilor Edwin Edwards with the Friendly Amendment to also discuss the same the same issue. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you very much. Councilor Flynn, is there any further discussion on docket 1005 saying none. One of the councilors wish to add their name. Madam Clerk, please add.

Report from Health and Human Services Recommendation to execute documents with the United States Department of Health and. Human Services to receive grant funding. In the amount of 5.4 million for the Life Coaching and the Fundamentals. Of Fatherhood. Project City Wide. So Stanford. Group. Vice mayor, council members, in addition to the $7. Million the workforce that we've just accepted, I'm to turn this over to. Our Health and Human Services Director Kelly Collopy to talk about another five and a half million. Dollars for a brand new program. Good evening, Council Members. The Life Coaching and Fundamentals of Fatherhood Project is the first time program in Long Beach aims to provide support to low income fathers to ensure that children are healthy, safe and emotionally secure. The program aims to improve father involvement through a comprehensive program that creates responsible fatherhood by increasing economic stability of the fathers , increasing their emotional well-being and the ability to connect with their children, as well as healthy co-parenting relationships. The program is going to target 600 low income first time fathers between the ages of 18 to 44 who've had a child born in the past five years. It's a it's a five year grant. Uh, 5,000,438 $7,465. And, um, basically the intervention of what they will be receiving is they'll get life coaching. They'll be assessed for job readiness and then mental health in the Met needs. So the fathers will receive an evidence based intervention through 13 week fatherhood and co-parenting groups at the partner sites. When they're ready, they'll be able to receive job training. That includes placement, financial literacy and monetary incentives for those who obtain a job and keep their job for more than three months. And finally, for those who need mental health services, the program will link them to appropriate mental health resources. In the end, participants will complete the program, and they'll have a graduation ceremony to show that their participation in improving the role of fatherhood. Thank you, Councilmember Your Honor. Thank you for their report. Just a few questions. Now, when you talk about you mentioned the demographic 16 to 40 to. 18 to 44. You. Because Rex is part of that population group. The Robert he has a job so he's he's cool. He's cool. Yeah. Underplayed in the city council. But the storyline in regards to the the mentoring and the and the education that they're going to get, it is going to be that before with with the with the gateway. Are they going to be in a classroom setting? How are you going to reach out to these individuals? And basically, how are you going to identify them and and ensure their participation? So we have ten partner agencies that we're working with to make referrals to the program. Once they're in that program, they'll receive the life coaching for 13 weeks and then they'll be working with goodwill for the training. So Goodwill so you're building partnerships with some other service agencies within the community as well in order to provide this dysfunction? Yes. Okay. Now and same the same I said last hour, although you're going to have a graduation, is there going to be something a carrot, I guess, that these individuals can get at the end a job or a degree enrollment in a in a college or university program? You know, so the drug the job training includes placement, financial literacy and monetary incentives. So if they're able to keep the job for more than three months, they'll receive an additional incentive. Okay. And one final question. Is there going to be some. How do I put this without being insensitive? Are these are students going to be, quote unquote, vetted for drug use? Criminal records. Those types of things. Or or is there going to be a forgiveness for some of that? You know, I don't know. I don't have the answer to that. But I can find out and get back to you. I mean, you have a 44 year old first time father. Dude's been around the block a couple of times, maybe a few alleys like me. So, you know, I'm just wanting to make sure that if there's going to be mentoring, that it's a positive type of mentoring and that, you know, you don't have some negative elements in there that you met with each other. You if you catch my drift. Right. I will get back to you with that information things. Like. Yes. You can be a mentor, Roberto. Councilman Austin, thank you. I did have a couple of quick questions. Is this a new grant for the city? It is a new grant, yes. Who seem to have a recall is having some kind of a program very similar to this out of the central area. Several years ago, they were kind of teaching life skills and and working with the young fathers. I think this is an excellent, excellent idea. This is I'm thrilled that we have this grant. And I'm even more thrilled that we'll be able to serve 600 low income, first time fathers through the city. Now, I do notice we hiring for this position. We will. Be hiring. Three new positions to be located at the Centers for Family and Youth. Okay. Thank you. Councilmember Richardson. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I guess my questions are similar to the questions on the last grant. How will this align with the local action plan we're developing for My Brother's Keeper, as well as our work with the very young adults, 18 to 24, who might be making a few mistakes, as well as our work with disconnected youth who aren't in school or in the workforce. How can we align this life coaching to help support those three initiatives? So these are first time fathers. So it's ages 18 to 44 who do have a child. And if you know that the child is within up to age five. So where it makes where it aligns with the rest of the programs. I see it as one more level of support to go with the rest of the programs in terms of providing job training and coaching and to be able to build the capacity that that and the strength and which also is a real strong prevention program, because stronger fathers, more effective fathers, will be doing much better with their children moving forward. Thank you. So I would just. Hope that, you know, all the key staff that are doing this fantastic work are coordinating on this because it's really impactful. And Councilmember Ranga I, I almost meet the qualification a few weeks ago for I got my new job and definitely was on the low income list. But with the county salary, with the council salary. But I think I just missed it now. But thanks a lot for thinking of me. Congratulations. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Thank you, Kelly, for this. I think this is wonderful that we're able to look at fathers a little bit more. We always look at mothers and and it's wonderful that we're able to do this now, where it's great that we'll be enrolling 600 low income, first time adult fathers of a C from high need areas. So which areas are they where we targeting specific zip codes or where would they these fathers be coming from? Exactly in the city. Where they'll be coming through ten different partner agencies. If they fit the criteria, then they would be able to be referred. So it's not specific. The services themselves will be that will be provided in our offices, that Center for Families and Youth, but also Families, Uniting Families and then at Goodwill. So they're all referred into this process. Okay, great. Thank you for your work. Thank you. Council members, is there any member of the public that wish to address Council on item 13? Seeing none.

It has been moved. And second, it was the public hearing for council bill 1021 is open may we have the staff report card on. Good evening president Brooks Kansas City Council members this is a landmark designation application for 2849 West 23rd Avenue. My name is Kara Hahn. I am a senior city planner with Landmark Preservation at Community Planning and Development. As you can see on slide to this is in Council District one and slide three shows that the Landmark Preservation Ordinance was established in 1967 and established preservation within the city and county of Denver to designate, preserve and protect. The ordinance was updated in 2006 and it was amended to include a demolition and a certificate of non historic status review. This is a community initiated application process, basically saying that all of us have a stake in preserving the city's history and architectural legacy. Demolition review of some sort is a fairly common practice in larger cities for preservation. In 2012, there was also an ordinance update. It was amended to allow for applications to be submitted by both the managers. The manager of Community Planning and Development as well as adding city council members as applicants. Slide number four goes in shows that a design review and demolition for designated properties properties are designated as is. There are no requirements for improvements. There are no requirements to renovate or rehab or restore a particular property. Design review is for exterior changes only and those are tied to permits. There is no reviewer review work on interior, on paint colors or anything like that, and on general maintenance. However, demolitions are highly discouraged. Slide five The applications are submitted proactively through surveys or grassroots efforts, or they can also come through the demolition review or the certificate of non historic status process. The swing came through through that process and for anyone who can to apply for a landmark designation, it can come from the owner of a property, from the manager of CPD, from a member of City Council as this particular one, or through three people who are residents, property owners, or have a place of business in Denver. The next couple of slides show sort of the history of the certificate in demolition applications as reviewed by community planning and development. It was started in 2006, and so Slide eight shows 2007 through 2015. The number of demolitions reviewed, the numbers of certificates of non historic status reviewed and then the properties posted for public notice. I wanted to note that 2013 and 2014 we don't have the numbers for the properties that were posted during those two years. The following slide on seven shows, all of the sort of percentages of properties that were posted either for or that were reviewed for demolition certificates of non historic status or properties posted in percentages of the numbers that we have reviewed of those in the last two years, we have only had a couple of those that actually came through as landmark designation applications and that eventually made it to City Council. On Slide eight, it shows the 2016 numbers for certificates of non historic status and demolition applications that have been reviewed this year. This is these are the numbers as of November 16 of this year. So last Wednesday or Thursday, we have reviewed about 580 and we did not post any of those. We reviewed and posted 33 properties. And just wanted to note that since Thursday, when I put those numbers together, we have another 20 that staff is currently reviewing. For this particular property. A certificate of non historic status application was received on August 1st of 2016. Landmarks staff reviewed the application and per the ordinance if we found it had the potential for designation. We posted the structure for public notice. A landmark designation application was received on September 13th when we received the landmark designation application lane marks after a couple of checks of it. First, we make sure it's just simply complete. In second, we go through and do a thorough evaluation to determine that it meets the criteria as well as that the information in it is accurate . So we if there are any citations in it, I go through and I make sure that those information is correct, that the census records are correct, that the city directories are correct. I go and look at the Sanborn fire insurance maps that the applicant has put together to make sure that the information with the lane marked within the landmark designation application is accurate. We found that it was. And so we set a public hearing for the Landmark Preservation Commission on October 18th. At that meeting, the Landmark Preservation Commission determined that the designation should be forwarded to City Council for your review. Prior to the Lpsc public hearing, we posted signage on the property. We notified the owner and the applicant through certified letters to the owner, as well as emails to both the owner and the applicant. We also notified the registered neighborhood organizations as well as interested stakeholders like Colorado Preservation Inc, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and Historic Denver. At that time, we also notified City Council Planning Board and the building inspectors and then posted it into the Daily Journal in October 6th. Throughout this process, when our staff has spoken with the owner, the applicant, and then historic Denver, as they have been trying to find a preservation minded buyer for this particular property. So on slide 11, it shows that the property is at 2849 West 23rd Avenue. The map shows that it is near the corner of Eliot and 23rd Avenue. The applicant was Councilmember Espinosa. It is in Council District one and it is, according to Blueprint Denver, an area of change. On the next slide, it shows the Chapter three requirements for a landmark designation. A property must one maintain its physical and historic integrity and then meet one designation criteria in two or more of the following categories history, architecture and geography. And finally, third, it needs to relate to a historic context or theme within Denver history. Slide 13 shows that the has a photo of the building and it shows that the property maintains its physical and historic integrity. The ordinance describes integrity as the ability of a structure to convey its historic and architectural significance and is being recognized as belonging to its particular time and place in Denver's history. Overall, this property has had minimal changes with the possible alteration of some of the windows. However, the fenestration pattern remains intact. The Preservation Commission had a discussion about the integrity and found that it had excellent integrity. Although there have been some minor changes to the rear of the building. The Sanborn Maps also show many of those changes occurred within the period of certain significance or the time period when the building was determined with historic. Slide 14 shows our goes through the three different criteria of history, architecture and geography. Landmark Preservation Commission found that it met it under history for C architecture A in geography A and I'll go through all three of those. So for history, it must have a direct and substantial association with a person or a group of persons who had influence on society. Burnham and Merrill Hoyt were prolific and noted Colorado architects. These are some of Colorado's homegrown architects. For the most part, most of our early architects were from out of state or came from somewhere else. These were architects who grew up here. They went to North High School. So these are people who resided in the neighborhood of Denver or who resided in Denver and grew up with Denver architecture. When they went on to design so many magnificent buildings. Burnham and Merrill Hoyt created a firm. Hoyt and Hoyt architecture. Slide 16 is an example of some of the properties that these two gentlemen designed. They both resided in the building and worked as draftsman early in their career. Merrill Hoyt then moved, moved out and stayed in Denver. BURNHAM Hoyt continued on his architectural training in New York and then came back in about 1919. And the two architect brothers designed almost all of these properties that you're going to see between 1919 and about 1926 or 1927, at which time Burnham Hoyt was residing in the house . So we have the Park Library, the Fourth Church of Christ Science and the Cherokee Castle. On the next slide, slide 17 we have examples of the Lake Junior High School, Saint Martins Chapel, the Denver Press Club, the Denver. Those were all designed by both brothers together collaboratively. The Denver Public Library was the last building that Burnham Hoyt designed. And then Burnham Hoyt is perhaps most well-known for designing Red Rocks. This is the sort of what made him internationally famous is his work on Red Rocks. So the Landmark Preservation Commission found that the both do that due to the association with both of the brothers having living and resided and working within the house, that the house had substantial influence and that they had substantial influence on society. On Slide 19, the Landmark Preservation Commission found that the building met the criteria under architecture, which is to embody distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type. In this instance, the Queen in style, oftentimes Queen Anne have steeply pitched roofs or complained complex roof plans, irregular plans, asymmetrical facades, projecting bays or windows. And the Queen Anne style is also known for having varying wall textures, as can be seen here in the gable and shingles. In the barge board. In the brackets. In the belt courses, the belt courses are the purple lines that you can see going horizontally across the building in the window surrounds and the variety of ways that the window is treated throughout the building and then finally in the turned porch on the front. And these are all characteristics of queen in styles. And in Denver, Queen Anne's are very typically brick buildings. And so this is an excellent, excellent example of the queen in style architecture. And finally, on July 20, the Landmark Preservation Commission found that the the property is significant under geography. This was noted in both the landmark designation application and then the Landmark Commission also recommended it forward forwarded because of its location as it overlooks Jefferson Park. It's on a steeply raised position and it provides views of both the park and of Denver. And this high, high location highlights the structure. It is also located along West 23rd Avenue, which is a thoroughfare. And so they found that it meets the criteria under geography as having a prominent location. Finally, a property also has to relate to historic contexts or themes in this property relates to 19th century high style Queen Anne style residence, and it reflects the development in the early growth of Denver and its early boom years, particularly in that area of the Highlands. Slide 22. It shows the comments in the petitions that we have received, that we have received eight letters in support or eight letters and or emails. We have received one letter in opposition. We have comments from the owners representatives. There's also been an online petition in support of the application. And then we. In your packets you also received the owner's presentation to LPC as well as the letter from the applicant. On Slide 23 is a summary that the property maintains its historic and physical integrity. That it meets one criteria in two or more of the following categories. It meets in three in history because it is associated with persons who had influence on society. With Burnham and Merrill Hoyt and their substantial architectural designs in architecture as it embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type and under geography as having a prominent location. It also relates to the context and theme. The LPC unanimously recommended approval and forwarding it on to City Council. And finally, on Slide 24, I just wanted to make a brief note. I know that there have been a few letters that have gone out about Discover Denver, which is an unrelated program to either the landmark designation or the certificate of non historic status process. Discover Denver is a building survey that's meant to identify historic and architecturally significant features and to identify places that matter in Denver history. It is a citywide survey program. The city of Denver has had other surveys done throughout its history, but we are working to do a larger citywide program . The Discover Denver program works hard to be very proactive to work with the Arnaud's and to talk to all of every city council member when we are in that particular district. We discovered Denver has been covered on night news as well as the Denver Post and various other organizations, and we just wanted to note that it is entirely separate from sort of this landmark designation process. Thank you care. All right. We have 38 speakers. And so how we're going to do this is we're going to leave this first bench open and I'm going to call the first five speakers. And if you could come and quickly and we can get through all of the speakers on time and have enough time for questions and discussion, some call the first five. Judith Battista. Beth greeted Larry Tanenbaum. Sorry, some of these we didn't get the spelling correct. Matthew Rourke and Joe Judd. And Judith Battista, you're up first with 6 minutes. Go ahead. You can. Say. Hello. My name is Judith Battista, the property owner at 2849 West 23rd Avenue. I humbly come before you to defend my house, my rights and my financial future regarding the hostile designation of my property. You know that saying you never know what someone is going through. So always be kind. Well, I come before you when I would rather be with my best friend fighting for her life with cancer. But instead I'm here fighting for my life, my rights, my house, and my financial future. Next page, please. I started with the quote because this hostile designation has been anything but kind to me. I am a single woman working two jobs that bought my property ten years ago. I knew there was some flaws, but I chose to paint over them instead. Over the years, the flaws came out even more and repair costs have soared for almost everything. I cannot afford the repairs or the upkeep. My house is my nest egg and my only retirement. I come from a family of civil servants, military police and fire. We are simple people with simple means. After my application submission people wanted to talk about my historic house. I was also contacted by Councilman Rafael Espinosa during business hours, which I informed him I could lose my job taking personal calls at work. It seemed to me that Councilman Espinosa had control over the certificate of non historic status, so I better speak to him and do what he says. I felt intimidated, scared and confused all at the same time. When we did speak after work, he became very pushy and would not allow me to speak or ask questions. This is the same behavior that he and his staff showed at a recent Japan meeting when they tried to bully me and shout me out. Shout me down. Sorry. There are witnesses in the room who can attest to that. In fact, Japan members finally had to tell them to stop. At the end of our conversation, the phone conversation, Councilman Espinosa threw out a figure not once, but twice. He asked if I would give him ten days to find a buyer at that amount, or he would oppose my application for non historic status and I have it designated against my will. I am a single woman who worked very hard to buy this house. It's all I have and feeling completely intimidated. I agreed to his terms. I honored my word and gave Councilman Espinosa ten days. He was unable to find a buyer. I kept my word. But yet Councilman Espinosa did not keep his. He filed is the only person on the application to have my house designated historic. The following day. Next page, please. I guess this is where I need to still follow protocol. And the reason I am here? Yes. Burnham and Merl Hoyt did live at my property. They were not born there. They did not design it. They did not die there. They never even owned the property. Burnham Hoyt is just getting out of high school when Red Rocks became an Ampitheater in 1906. BURNHAM Hoyt did not get his Colorado architectural license until 1925. Next page. Many of the original structures from Sanborn surveys of the property are not currently on site. Two wooden structures have been removed and the garage has been added. The next page, please. The front porch is not original either. The original design has a wrap around wooden front porch. Next page, please. My house needs a completely new sewer line. This is an issue due to a huge pine tree and a rich retaining wall. I don't even want to discuss the terrible sewer smell throughout my house. The water line needs to be replaced. My water supply is delivered in galvanized pipes, which makes my water brown. Next page. The 20 plus years old rope needs to be replaced. The roof replacement, quote, received is over $15,000. The contractor could not even tell me what historic roofs would cost. Next page. There are numerous foundational cracks that penetrate the entire foundation. I have had every single window sill pop and the company that put them in has gone out of business. Next page, please. All the wood on the exterior is rotted. The fascia, the soffit, the scaling and other details are mostly held up with paint. The. Paint job from ten years ago no longer hides all of these repairs. Next page. The cost associated with fixing up my property is very close to $100,000. But when historic status is mandated to my property, the cost would certainly double. We have provided a few quotes as examples. The next page, please. Before this happened to me, I would never have believed that this could happen to an American. The three people with $875 can file to have your property designated historic against your will. They don't even have to live in Denver. Or worse, one councilman with $0 can do the same thing and now can sit up there and vote against me. This hostile designation process is stacked against the homeowner. I cannot afford these attorneys and I certainly cannot afford experts. Meanwhile, Councilman Espinosa has unlimited resources. The LPC, who suspects that. Your time is up. Okay. Thank you. Yup. Best critic. Hello. My name is Beth Goodrich. Thank you for hearing this. I'm a native of Colorado, and I've chosen to live in Denver since 1998. Attracted me to Denver was the diversity in neighborhoods and everything that goes along with it. I love the city for everything that it has to offer. I have my businesses downtown, which is in District nine on Larimer Street, and I feel there is a certainly there is a place for the historic thing to go on, by all means, and we abide by that. But you may wonder why I'm here. Since my businesses are there, I strongly believe that there is a time and a place to protect the older buildings. I happen to own my home in Sunnyside, where the neighborhood is seeing a lot of diversity and change. Some of it is more esthetically pleasing than others, but I'm a believer that we should be able to sell our homes to whomever and whenever we want it. When we own our homes. This restriction is excuse me, this restriction that they're trying to place on this particular home is not justified. I understand that there are areas of town that have been voted to keep old homes old, and this is a full disclosure during the sale of the property. This is not the case. There seems to be a discrimination in regard to this particular home and situation. Again, my stance is I believe there is a time and a place for this historic society to protect. But this is just not the case. Thank you. Thank you. Larry Tanenbaum. You have six, 6 minutes. Council members. My name is Larry Tanenbaum. I appear on behalf of and by the way, I live two, three, three, one South Fig Street, Lakewood, Colorado. But I've lived most of my life in Denver and work almost all my working life in Denver. I also went to Denver Public Schools. I appear on behalf of the Northside High School Alumni Association, 1500 members, and we're speaking and I will speak in support of the ordinance proposed. My position with the association, it's a voluntary position is as an archivist and a historian, we keep records, files, memorabilia. Of our alumni, staff, faculty, important figures in Denver history. We become involved in issues relating to North Denver, for example, the preservation of the Golden Warehouse. We were actively involved in that. You have two prior letters. I sent one to the Landmark Commission. I also sent a letter to counsel. I'm going to try not to repeat what I said in those letters. I assume you all have them and have had a chance to read it. Meryl Hoyt was born in 1881. BURNHAM Hoyt was born in 1887, so Merrill was eight when he moved into the house his parents purchased, and it was built in 1889. Burnham was two. They spent their entire childhoods in those houses, in that house. Burnham for my estimation, looking through records, probably spent about 40 years of his life living in this house. That's at issue here. It appears to me without question that this house and its location and the neighborhood it had an influence on on these gentleman's later careers as architects. They designed many significant buildings in Denver. Red Rocks, the ampitheater that we know today was designed by Burnham Hoyt, and it was built by the WPA in the thirties. It was just a hillside with these great rock formations prior to that. You saw just some of the buildings that the Burnham and Merrill designed. Unquestionably. These are two major figures in Denver history. I was here earlier when you were discussing an ordinance honoring a historic Denver figure. BURNHAM Hoyt is also a giant figure in Denver history. His presence is everywhere you see it. Merrill was a principal in the firm that designed this building we're sitting in and unquestionably had some impact and influence in the designs of the city and county building. Thomas Noel, a well-known historian of Denver, and its history spans several pages discussing the heights and says the Burnham stands out for his from his peers as the foremost mid-twentieth century architect. One thing is certain if this designation is not granted. This house will be demolished in an area where many houses have been demolished. It will be replaced by a multifamily. Insignificant, architecturally insignificant structure that quite frankly, will be downright ugly, the areas filled with them already. That's a certainty. If if this house isn't protected, we don't know who the who is going to develop this property because the owner has steadfastly refused to disclose the developer. Very likely. And we don't know. But I'm going to speculate that it is an out-of-state developer with lots of money who could care less about Denver and could care less about Denver's history. And that's who's going to profit here. That's who's going to make money. We know none of the details of what's been offered to the landowner by the developer. Landowners use of his or her property is not absolute. A landowner cannot absolutely do whatever they want with the property. There's a reason why there are zoning. There is historical overlays, there's conservation overlays and easements. If we're going to have an ordered society, there has to be some sort of control for the benefit of all citizens. There cannot be unrestricted use of property. Denver is at a crossroads right now, particularly in northwest Denver. If this house and you've seen the significance of this house, if this house is not entitled to a historic designation, then what is this house is entitled? It meets all the criteria. Many, many buildings have been torn down in Denver, particularly in northwest Denver. If the landmark ordinance is to have any meaning at all, this landmark designation should be granted for the Hoyt residents. I'm urging you to take the right path, the correct path for the citizens of Denver, past and present, and designate this House as a landmark. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Mr. Tenenbaum. Matthew Rourke. Good evening, counsel. Thank you for your time. Matthew Rourke, the work at 1801, California attorney and I represent Judith Battista. You've probably seen some of my letters, been involved in an earlier process. We've come to know a hostile designation. And surely Denver's landmark preservation ordinance is broken. And as we've seen recently, ripe for abuse over the past several years, those that are very opposed to development in the city have realized that they can interfere with the property owners legitimate rights to sell or develop his or her property by filing a historic designation application with the City Land City's Landmark Preservation Office against the property owners wishes. Notably, it does not take an application for a certificate of non historic status or a demolition permit to trigger the historic designation process. Rather, at any time three residents or business owners located anywhere in the city. Whereas we have seen this case, a single city council member can apply to start the process against the structure. What then follows is an extremely one sided, unfair and costly process that gives little, if any, consideration to the wishes of the opposing property owner. The property owner is given a total of 10 minutes of the LPC commission hearing, another 3 to 6 minutes here to oppose and protect, try and protect their property rights. Moreover, once the Commission recommends the property be designated as historic, which it always does, the owner is then afforded another 3 to 6 months here at the council . Most of the time the residents don't realize that when they purchase an older home in the city, it's not located in the horse historic district that they're subjected. They could be subjected to this process. The ordinance was meant to preserve structures that truly merit historic designation. What I've seen over the past several years, that has become something entirely different. In the case of Judith Battista, we have an application from a single council member who has shown through his recent interactions with her and the neighborhood organization that he is not capable of being impartial in this matter. We've submitted some written objections for the record, incorporating those by reference. We do not believe it is appropriate for Councilman Espinosa to submit his own application again to hastily designate a property and then sit on the dais and vote in favor of that application. With respect to the Landmark Preservation Commission, we object to the extent that they've added a criteria that was not in the application and was beyond the recommendation of the staff. Geography was never part of the equation. They added that at the last minute to try and bootstrap their recommendation. The ordinance process itself must be changed to prevent further abuses of this kind and to ensure that the property owners rights are adequately protected going forward. We intend on working proactively with the Council as part of a mass swallowing of an organization that's now being developed to try and make some changes to this ordinance so that it's not abused any further. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Burke. Let's go with this bunch. Joel Judd. Mr. President and members of the council. First off, I want to thank you for your stamina. Some of you know me as Representative Judd. I had the honor. Of representing House District five in the Legislature for eight years. I live at the corner of 24th. And Eliot. As you heard earlier, the house you're considering. Is just off of the corner of 23rd. And Eliot, so I'm a block away. I bought my house in 1979. So I've been there a little while. The reason I'm here is actually has more to do with not where I live now, but but where I grew up. I grew up in the Park Hill neighborhood. When I was five years old. My folks walked me up to kindergarten at Park Hill Elementary and the Path a Longmont view went past a couple of very substantial buildings. There's a masonic temple, and there was another building. Which I didn't have much reason to think about in kindergarten. But as years went by, I did learn to read and that building became very important to me. It was the Park Hill Public Library. A stucco building with. Half curved shingles on the top. Well, I spent a good bit of my life there in the Park Elementary Hyde Park Hill Library. And I have to tell you, I won't credit Bertram Hoyt with having taught me how to read. He doesn't do that. But he did create a building that. Gave me an awful lot of interest. In going in there. And I. Did end up becoming quite a bit of a reader. And I can't say that what he did had had no. Contribution to that. So I'm here today. Yeah, I know. A late, middle aged, balding man. But the impetus for coming here. Is. Really something that happened to me when I was seven, eight, nine years old. So my request to you. Is to. Honor. Say to the seven, eight, nine year old Burnham White and his brother, who grew up in that house down the block for me and did quite a bit to enrich my life. And so. You know, if you can preserve his house. I think you'll have done a good thing and both for their memory and also I think there'll be a value to Denver. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Judd. I'm going to call the next five folks. Louis Bussey, Joe DeRose, Sheila Peoples, Brad Evans, and then Ft. Lewis, you are first. Good evening. Members of council. I'm Louis Bussey. I currently live in West Highlands. Although for most of the 1970s, I lived in a house that I still own on River Drive. Which is a quaint little street. I've always been concerned about historic preservation. I am a retired Colorado architect. Formerly specializing in residential, light, commercial and land planning. I'm neither an advocate nor an opponent of this bill, but I offer what I believe could be a viable option to both parties. The option is the relocation of the Hoyt House. To a news site. Preserving the structure and history while allowing the current owner to move forward with plans for the current House site. Two blocks east on 23rd Avenue from the White House is a vacant lot that I own. And have for some time. While smaller the lot. Meets the required zoning size and setbacks for the house, along with space for a new two car garage. The light the lot itself may require some zoning adjustments as far as lot coverage and minor bolt play. In order for this to work for me, I would require the transfer of the House title free of charge. Unknown to me at this time is the actual condition of the house. Which would need to be determined. I would plan to provide a probably an estimated $200,000 of work for new foundation side work, interior renovation, new garage furnace, utility upgrades, etc.. Such a move. However, even only two blocks away would not be cheap and its cost is likely well outside my funding capabilities. Perhaps a creative compromise could be worked out in that regard. The result, however, would be a renovated, high single family home that should be looked at favorably by historic Denver. For inclusion as a contributing structure not only to the Jefferson Park neighborhood, but also for the River Drive. Itself, which is inhabited by a number of. Interesting. Interesting. Victorian and Queensland cottage structures. So I'm again, I apologize for coming to you late. I recently returned from overseas and just heard about this just within the last week, and that's my option. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bassey. Something. Something tells me that someone's going to call on you later, so I hope you can stay to the end. Joe DeRose. Mr. President. Council, thank you for this time. There is something positive in all of this. My name is Joe DeRose. I'm a retired Denver public school teacher, lifelong resident of Northwest Denver, a graduate of North High School and a teacher at North High School. And having this property come to the fore as a hearing about the historical significance of people who went north before me, it really what brought me here tonight, this building and I don't know about its architectural significance. It's a beautiful painted lady. It really is a neat property. I've seen it. I walk by it, and it's a wonderful place. But I want to speak to a very specific historical connotation or context in which this building exists. Burnham and Merrill Hoyt went to North High, and many students had they had Lake then built. At the time they were growing up, they would have gone to lake. However, they built lake and North has always been somewhat of an immigrant school. And having this property at least come to the fore here in this hearing, and maybe the property could be preserved or in some manner always remembered because kids that go to lake aren't kids go to north here and see always. Their culture is imported. It's imported is it's imported from the east, from someplace else. And yet here is a building that many of them will have attended by the time they come to North. And they will get to know that the architects actually went to the school that they went to. This is a grounding that is beyond just dollars and cents. I appreciate that there is property rights, and the only thing I would say about that is the passing of this historical designation would not all ultimately stop these property rights from being exercised, but it would delay them. It would allow more conversation and more education. And with that, I want to thank you. Thank you, Sir Sheila Peoples. Good evening, counsel. Mine is very simple and sweet. My name is Sheila K Peebles. I reside at 2939 South Boulevard, District two, Harvey Park. I'm a very proud Harvey Park resident. I've been raised in our family home for 51 years. I have a daughter now. And I am also a. Proud owner of a multitude of couple homes in the Harvey Park area. So being a single mother, looking at investment and what I'm going to retire with, my biggest fear is, is this going to happen to me? How am I. Assured that this is not going to happen to me? I can't afford what Ms.. Batista's going through. I couldn't afford all the time and the money. So in my thought, thinking, I, I love the idea of saving Denver and the historical process, but my property rights, I can understand that I need to take care of me. Historical committee. Are they going to control that? I understand churches, schools, parks, libraries to be saved. What about my home? What about my family? We all live within the Harvey Park area. Thank you so. Much. Thank you, Miss Peoples. Brad Evans. Thank you. My name is Brad Evans. Thank you for having me here. I appreciate the time. I've been a Jefferson Park resident since 2004. Bought my first house at 28th and Elliot. So this is my neighborhood has been my neighborhood since that time. I wanted to talk about some of the myths that have been spoken in this whole process, that that property rights are un-American, that preservation is un-American. I think also importantly, that historic designation will reduce my property values that. Has been proven over and over. False. I work in the real estate business and since 2006, Jefferson Park has changed. The values of the houses have changed there. I did some look look up some of the MLS since on the 10th of November, a house on 28th sold for 600,000, actually 591,000 River Road, which is kind of the highest, maybe the most historic part of Jefferson Park, a house there sold for 653,000. So those are houses that are being preserved, but just by by the transfer of ownership, not necessarily with this process, some things are worth saving. I think this House, there's not much left in Jefferson Park that's worth saving. But this house kind of shows historic people, historic place. I ask you to consider it in saving. What? What's worth saving? Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Evans. Dan Feed. Thank you, Mr. President. And the. Council. My name is Dan Feed. I am a resident of Belle. Carroll Park in south east Denver. I'm currently serving. On the board of directors there. This is my second go around. I just wanted to briefly mention a story we had. Six years ago. We had a similar situation. A homeowner. Bought a 19,000. Square foot piece of dirt at 825 South Adams, and he was going to build his retirement. Home. There. And within our own neighborhood, there were a couple people that put a hostile designation on his house. His house was a beautiful, beautiful mid-century ranch home. One of my favorite architectural styles. That's why I could. Really appreciate Christina earlier tonight. I love old homes. I love old cars. I restore old cars. And. I love this house. When I think about the story we had in Belle Carroll, Parkville, the home there was severely. It had deferred maintenance. It would have taken more money to bring that home up to speed, to make it a pristine. Restored residence than it would have. Been worth. And when I look at Judy's home here. I can completely. Appreciate. The historical nature of it. But knowing what restorations cost, I think it's it's really not a feasible, viable project. The only way it could be viable is if it were relocated to another site or if historic Denver would purchase the home themselves and restore it and make something similar to the Molly the Molly Brown house. If they were to purchase it. I would suggest. A fair market value. So that's that's a I just wanted to share that I am about private property rights. I'm about saving Denver when we can and when it's feasible. I just wanted to share that tonight. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ft. All right. We have the next five speakers if the folks out front would return to the seats and be helpful. Joan Bolduc sorry if we pronounced that wrong. Nathan Adams. Marilyn Quinn. Ken below and Paul. Cloyd. Joan. You will be first. Hello. My name is Joan Bolduc. I live in the West Highlands neighborhood. 303330338 Thanksgiving. With the rapid pace of growth in Denver, we are losing the historic buildings that connect us to our past. The 100 plus year old former residence of renowned architect Merrill Merrill and Burnt Burnham Hoyt is now in danger. This great city has values, some of which the city council celebrated and proclaimed tonight. I believe that preservation of our shared history and heritage is one. Such common value is what nourishes our communities and neighborhoods and holds together our social fabric. Denver has a landmark preservation ordinance to protect these buildings and our shared heritage. Please join the Denver's own Landmark Commission recommendation to grant protection from demolition to this house. The owner still can sell it. She can still remodel it. She just won't be able to demolish it. Merrill and Burnham Hoyt not only influence Denver in their lifetime, but their work influences. The look and feel. Of Denver, the city beautiful, and the house they grew up in. And the later Burnham return to has a part of how that happened. Please protect the structure. And I would just like to say that I'm sorry that this process has been so difficult for the owner. Nobody means this personally or whatever. We just really care about our heritage and we support our councilman, Rafael Espinosa, in this endeavor. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Body. Nathan Adams. Good evening, council members. My name is Nathan Adams at. 2899 North Sphere Boulevard. I'm the owner of three businesses headquartered in Jefferson Park. I'm also a survivor of hostile historic designation council elect Espinosa. At the time, I filed a hostile application on a property that my company was involved with. I know firsthand what Judith is going through sleepless nights, anxiety over what could be forced upon her, and anger that she's been thrust into the spotlight against her will. It sucks. It's unfair. And beyond voting this down tonight, we need to look to change the law so that one signature on an application and application completed by historic Denver and not the applicant can have such a profound impact on someone's life and financial livelihood. The businesses I own are all real estate related. I'm a licensed broker, a developer, and I own a construction company. I can testify that you this property is worth more for its land value than it is encumbered by a hostile, historic , encumbered by a historic designation that ensures the House remains standing regardless of its condition. The land value is between 300 and $400,000 year. Additionally, if designated, Judith will be saddled with repairs and maintenance she cannot afford and will be held to a standard that will make her comply with stringent historic standards. Mere window replacement alone could cost triple what it otherwise would. You may hear proponents of the designation complain that Judith is not entertaining. Offers and not. Opening her home to other prospective buyers. This argument is nonsense. If Judith has hired a competent broker that understands, as I do, the value of what she owns is in the land and she can sell the property and as is condition. Why should Judith cave to the demands of a few people that have caused her undue grief and anxiety over a future sale of her property? I encourage you to vote against designation and vote in Judith's favor. Please send a clear message to Councilman Espinosa that these hostile designations are not something we as a city want to spend our tax dollars on. City council has more important things to do for the people of Denver. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Adams. Marilyn Quinn. I'm pleased to speak in support of designation of this home as a Denver landmark because world class city heritage. Can you introduce yourself just for the record, I. Thought you had Marilyn Quinn. Just great. Thank you. Sorry to interrupt. But to start over. Yeah. You can start over. I'm pleased to speak in support of designation of this home as the Denver landmark because a world class city values its heritage. The stately home has met all three criteria required for designation as a Denver landmark. It has an architectural, historic and geographic significance to the city of Denver. It has maintained its historic integrity and appears to be in good structure, good enough structural condition that is apparently rented out at this time. According to the Denver Post yesterday, although the owner tonight sounds like she's living with water that isn't drinkable. So I'm not sure which to believe. But I would just like to say that when the unsustainable practice of scraping older homes started to become common in Denver, we were told that the only homes being destroyed were derelict and of poor quality. If that were ever true, it is certainly not the case now. Properly maintained, this home could last another century, but instead it faces demolition and adding to the waste in our landfill. Too often, buildings of this quality are being replaced with ones built to last 30 or 40 years. Some in my neighborhood have begun to show exterior, structural, exterior and structural deterioration after as little as six years. There is a market for homes like this one. Several near me have sold in the last few years for prices at the very top of the market. Until last spring, the landmarked home next to me was regarded by many as too far gone to save. But it found new owners who transformed the exterior to its original beauty. And last month, in just six months, it was on a home tour. Property owners who are not interested in maintaining an older home can sell it at a substantial profit without leaving their neighbors in a vastly diminished space. Please remember that a city is more than just a cluster of properties. I strongly encourage you to follow the unanimous recommendation of the Denver Landmark Commission and designate this historic residence a Denver landmark. Thank you, Mr. Quinn. Quinn below. Can below. My name is Ken below. Thanks for letting me speak. I reside in the. Hari Park neighborhood and I have recently found out that my neighborhood is also on the historic Denver hit list. So I'm just here to speak on behalf of Judith that I feel it's it's not. Right that. She's being forced to restore. And I worked in construction. For 15 years. And I know the cost of restoration. I when I bought my home, I did a lot of work. And and to find out that, you know, historic Denver might designate my my neighborhood. As a hostile takeover is something I don't feel is right. And to have a council councilman. Head, it is not right also. So thank. You. Thank you. Mr. below. Paul Cloyd. Thank you, Mr. President. My name is Paul Cloyd. I'm an architect and an engineer. I resided on my own home in Denver in the District one, and have done so since 1984. I speak today at an opposition of the hostile certification of historic set status, and I'm in support of the landmark designation. The Hoyt residence tells an important part of our city's story. The Hoyt resident should be preserved and not too polished. The Hoyt residence unequivocally meets all three landmark criteria, as evidenced by the unanimous recommendation from the commission. You should be aware that this house is the oldest remaining structure facing Jefferson Park. It's the last queen. And so if you don't approve this, I guess I can promise you they'll never be another queen. And destroyed facing Jefferson Park. The few remaining older homes that are along the park date from the early part of the 20th century. As has been said by many others, this House is of particular historic significance because of its association with Beryl Burnham. Hoyt The criteria, it talks about influence on the development of the city. And as has been pointed out, you don't have to look far. Just look to the east here and you can see the Denver Public Library. Burnham's 1955 international style design. But you don't even have to look that far. It's also been mentioned this building. This room was influenced by Merrill Hoyt as a member of the Allied Architects Association of Denver, which was responsible for the design of this building . Now, here's a fun fact. While I was researching Meryl's involvement with the design of this building, I learned that the fourth floor, this room included, was originally planned as the city jail. Nothing applied there. But I'll just conclude by saying that if we do lose the residents to demolition, I think it would be a crime. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. Cloyd. All right, now we have the next five speakers. If you'd come to the front here. Moses Salgado. Jerry Olsen. Scott Richmond. H. Scott Richmond. Bryan Spindle. And Diana Rodriguez. Moses Salgado. You will be first. Okay. Hello. My name is Moises. I live with my family at 23/30 Street and Jefferson Park. This whole process had me thinking about the future, and I'm wondering if this will happen to my family as well. I don't think it's fair that other people have the ability to decide what happens to our properties like everyone else. Our family bought our house as an investment for the future. I'm truly worried about the situation because our family has been working very hard all her life and this is my father telling me he deserves every cent. And if something like this was to happen to our house, the value would drop. Councilman Espinoza recently compared our rights to the prison, to our personal homes, to activists taking over land in Oregon. That is ridiculous. I'm all about conservation in situations where it's a church or a school or even a restaurant. Not this, though. This is someone's home and only they should be allowed to choose what happens to it. In conclusion, I would like to say that this is not fair, and I encourage you to vote against this landmark designation. Moses. Can you say your name for the record? Cecil. Thank you. Jerry Olson. Yes. Thank you. I have prepared statement. My name is Gerry Olsen. Reside at 2195 Decatur Street Unit 312. I've been there ten years. Graduated from North High School in 1959. Long before you were. Some of your even born. But I want to go on and say I'm in favor of the preservation of the Hoyt house. Last night I posted a statement on Denver Fugly Facebook page about lessons learned from the acquisition and demolition of the Anderson House at 2329 Elliott Street just around the corner. Now. I would commend you to read that to get some more detail in regard to this. Acquisition that had has some lessons for the Hoyt House and the property owner. In brief, following your decision to deny the request for the historic preservation of the Anderson House, Old Jim was paid $1,010,000 in January 2016, and 43 days later, the developer who's here tonight sold the same property for a cool two point. To. $2,261,000. At that meeting, you were informed that we had a cash offer, a $1,100,000, which included preservation of the Anderson House and development of 14 townhomes on the balance of the land. When we lost your vote, when we lost your vote, the developer went on North on Federal Boulevard and he happened to our developer. Is currently preserving and. Redeveloping the Basler house of which you're well aware but anyway so out of out of the Fugly there are a couple of things that came upon came about. First, the house should be prepared. Should be preserved with encouraging redevelopment and. Allowing the preservation of the White House. You can have both. You could have had both on the Anderson property. The second recommendation that was voiced in Fugly is in fact to establish a fund to assist owners of historic homes in the cost of maintenance. And I would suggest that you be ask the city to conduct a feasibility study. Mr. Wilson. Regard. Your time is up. Thank you. I support the Hoyte house and I appreciate your vote in favor and preservation. Thank you. Scott Richmond. H. Scott Richmond. Good evening. I thank you, councilman. President. My name is Howard Scott Richmond and I. Am with Cherry Creek. Properties and I represent Judith Battista. I'm here to set the record straight. Regarding untruthful. Statements that have been made. About my client and myself. First, I want to go on record that I have not received any offer on my client's property that has been originated by historic Denver LPC or Councilman Espinosa. Again, there are zero offers, despite what you may hear. We have always been very, very clear. She has an offer for the property as is. Any offers would have to meet the same criteria established well before the events of this proceedings. As an as is offer, it doesn't require an inspection or showing. If a buyer were truly interested in saving this property for the same price. They do not need to come snoop around inside the Ms. of the contentious process. The promise and non-delivery on offer is often referred to in the real estate world as buyers are liars. I've had a few phone calls and emails regarding the property and I inform all parties of this process at every occasion. Second, at the JPM meeting in the councilman in the public minutes. Councilman Espinosa attacked my credibility. I have been a licensed since 2006. I take my real estate license incredibly serious, and my reputation is everything to me. I use it as a pay it forward part of my life. I try to help people out who. Are upside down on. Their mortgage. Need to move quickly or in some type of financial bind. In fact, I take a loss on my taxes. Many years on my real estate business to give back to the community. Typically, a person's. Primary residence is by far their largest overall personal investment. When my client purchase her home many years ago, she took a huge risk in the neighborhood that had many safety issues. She watched and waited patiently to see the community grow up and become a mature neighborhood. She also watched as her house deteriorated. To a level that repair and upkeep were at were beyond her financial means. My client is not against. Historic. Designations, but when it's appropriate, in my opinion, there's. Nothing appropriate about hostile designation process. Is it appropriate to take away the rights of a. Homeowner and to sell their primary residence away? Is it appropriate to use the entire resources of the LPC. Historic society and the office in the city councilman against the citizen? Is it appropriate to be able to submit an application and. Then sit down and. Judge for that same application as agents in real estate? We must obtain consent. To sit on both sides of the transaction. In my opinion, none of this is appropriate. This hearing is considered an official proceeding, and my client understands that her limited. Time frame to attest and defend her home, she must present all the facts against all my professional real estate advice. My client has publicly expressed all the faults. Of her property. In the real estate world. This is aligned with stories. Your time is up. Okay. Thank you. I'd like you to vote against the House designation. Thank you. Thank you. Brian Spindle. Good evening. I'm Brian Spindle. I've been a lifelong Denver resident. I've been a resident of that neighborhood for 32 years. And I would just like to. Express my. Heartfelt support of this designation and of Councilman Espinosa's efforts in this regard. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Friend. Dana Rodriguez. We get. All right. Good evening. My name is Dana Rodrigues. I'm a restaurant owner. I have two. One in Reno, one in Larimer Square. Also a homeowner. When I was reading this article on the Denver Post, it really hits me about my home and my businesses. That is my future for my kids. I'm a single mom with three kids. I want them to finish college. I want them to be successful. I wanted to provide everything for them and give something to their future. And my retirement, too. For some of us, it's at least to me, like 18 years to buy my houses, to buy my businesses. And I don't want to be where it is right now. I feel that we should have the right to decide what we do with our investments. We were really hard to get it, and I understand that there are some neighborhoods that, yeah, we wanted to keep it together. I'm not sure if this one is the right one. There is a lot of new places going around that house, new buildings. I don't know how the little house is going to look around all those new buildings. I don't know if you guys all have the power to do something for assets and owners and also for historical homes. Try to figure it out so you don't hurt families. You don't hurt businesses. And also you preserve what it has value for our cities. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Rodriguez. Okay. We're going to bring up the next five speakers, Beth GLINTON and Annie Levinsky. Rodolfo Cannon. Brant Weekley. And Maribel Salgado. Okay. Beth, you have 3 minutes. Your first. Great. Thank you. My name is Beth Glanton and I serve as the director of the Discover Denver Citywide Building. Survey. Project. And my office is located at 1420 Ogden Street. Discover Denver is a historic resource survey. Project that's led by historic Denver and. The city and county of. Denver, with funding by the Colorado State Historical Fund. Discover Denver is a building and. Neighborhood survey that's meant to identify historic and architecturally significant buildings citywide. Survey is conducted. By professionals and trained by volunteers and involves collecting public record data about Denver's. Buildings. And that data that we collect is. Made available to the public. This kind of survey work is common in American. Cities and has been done in Denver since the late 1960s. Discover Denver does extensive outreach in each survey neighborhood, and we welcome the input of neighborhood residents. Bless you. You are outreach includes press releases, community meetings. And information gathering events that we call. Discovery days in each neighborhood. Discover Denver is an information gathering project, so we do not grant historic designations. We do not initiate design, review or impose any requirements on any of the areas that we survey. I was made. Made aware that there were. Some questions about our project, and since we did some work in Jefferson Park in 2015, I just wanted to be available for any questions that anyone might have. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, any levinsky and you have 6 minutes. Thank you. I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of Historic Denver. And Historic Denver is a nonprofit, membership based advocacy organization founded in 1970. We are not the entity that makes historic designation decisions. So I think there's been a little confusion this evening, and I wanted to clarify that we do often work with groups like Cross on a Park who you saw earlier and other communities that are interested in pursuing historic preservation solutions. Tonight, you've already heard a lot about the significance of the home at 2849 West 23rd. You've heard about the criteria historic, architectural and geographic. Historic. Denver's board of trustees weighed this very same information. And the and they weighed the challenges of situations like this, because we recognize the seriousness of this process and the decision that you as counsel will face. We concur that this home clearly and strongly meets the landmark designation criteria, which includes its long and strong association with Architect Brothers Burnham and Merrill Hoyt. The Hoyt parents were the first owners of the home, and by the time their widowed mother died and the home sold more than 40 years later, Merrill had unexpectedly died, but Burnham was on his way to becoming Denver's foremost homegrown architect. It was from this home that both Marilyn Burnham walked to the local schools, first the Boulevard School and later North High School. It was to this home that Burnham returned after attending the local table art in Paris, and in this home that he pondered over the early designs for places like Lake Middle School and Park Hill Library . As our city debates issues of affordable housing, design, quality and character, and we embark on long term plans like the update to blueprint Denver, the legacy of Burnham and Merrill Hoyt becomes even more profound. It's hard not to wonder how this house, this neighborhood and the neighborhood schools of their youth influenced both Burnham and Merrill's prolific careers , including Merrill's commitment to designing beautiful and affordable homes for the masses through the architect's Small House Service Bureau, which he led, and Burnham Shining Glory. The design for Red Rocks Amphitheater designated a national historic landmark last year. The home strong connection to people who fundamentally shaped the city that we know and love makes this potential loss that much more meaningful. Demolition is nothing new in Jefferson Park. Over the last several years, dozens of 19th century homes and duplexes have been demolished to make way for larger development. The White House is not the first historically or architecturally significant home lost in the compact neighborhood. However, it is likely the most significant and it is nearly the last two facing Jefferson Park. Yes, portions of Jefferson Park are in an area of change in the Blueprint Denver plan, but we have to ask whether change means nothing of significance is to remain to tell the rich and diverse story of one of our oldest neighborhoods at historic Denver, we elected to focus our energy on seeking a buyer based solution for this property and, if possible, a win win outcome to correct a previous misstatement. Historic. Denver was not the author of this designation application, but we believe that there was a real chance that we could find a buyer who could give Ms.. Battista a competitive market rate offer. Since October, when we first and finally received some correspondence from the property owner, we have been actively seeking a preservation minded buyer under the constraints presented to us by the owner and Mr. Richmond, those included, that the offer needed to be for both 28, 49 and 2839 West 23rd that it have no contingencies. And that had come in prior to tonight's hearing offers also had to be made without a visit to the sites or a visit to the inside of the homes to fully evaluate the redevelopment opportunities as showings were not granted, we were also provided with no framework for what the owner might consider a reasonable offer. But we tried to persevere anyway. Using the information that is available. We believe that given the zoning a development that includes both preservation and new construction with the addition of more housing units on both parcels is possible. Given this, we were able to identify three potential buyers, including two developers, with the legitimate capacity and will to make this happen. All three did contact Mr. Richmond directly, but all were discouraged by the lack of information or basic cooperation that would have been necessary to achieve a firm offer by today's deadline. We have made no statements that we had an offer, but we did make statements that we had interested parties and local developer Charlie Woolley gave me permission to share that he was one of the interested parties. Charlie has completed a number of complex adaptive reuse, preservation and affordable housing projects. He was ready, able and willing to pursue this win win solution, but felt that his interest was quickly rebuffed. As is our practice. Our intention was to be collaborative and to work in good faith with the owner. We had hoped for the same from her and her agent. This strikes at the heart of the issue with the demolition review process. The demolition review portion of Chapter 30 was adopted unanimously in 2006 to prevent the surprise demolition of buildings that are important in our community. And we understood and the community understood at the time that this would not result in designation for every eligible property. And that has been the case with only one property designated as a result of this process since 2006, despite the hundreds of demolition permits that we saw on the graph earlier. And only six bodies have ever reached this, but only six. Properties have reached this body for consideration in that ten year period. However, the ordinance was intended to provide a window of time for the property owner and the community to come together to find common ground. We have examples of success stories, but in order for this to work and to avoid contentious council hearings, both parties must be willing to come to the table. And there must be a reasonable amount of time for all parties to vet fair alternatives and to agree on a course of action. The choice does not have to be demolition or designation. There is a lot of room to find fair solutions in between. The demolition review ordinance was also intended to ensure that we know what we're losing before it is lost. And over the last decade, there is no place where the impact of our lost heritage, both physical and intangible, is more visceral than Council District one. The tool that is being employed this evening may not be your preferred tool for historic preservation, but I'm here to ask you to recognize that we are losing places in Denver that we cannot replace or regain. On behalf of historic Denver, I want to ask you for your help to sustain and develop policies and programs that ensure that as our city grows and changes, it retains its culture, its identity and its soul. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, Rudolfo Cannon. And you have 6 minutes. Good evening. My name is Rodolfo Cannon. I live in District ten and 981 South High Street, and I operate my real estate business from my office located in District one. I'm speaking tonight because I have experience with the law in question and in dealing with Landmark on multiple occasions. I have been in real estate for over ten years, relatively early in my career. I was a very close spectator in a hostile, historic designation to gentlemen who were custom home builders and partners in their business. Bought a property on East Exposition Avenue. I think this would be District ten is my guess. On the north border of the Bonnie Brae neighborhood, directly next door to that little school. We're still street meets exposition. This was roughly a two acre property with a really big old house on it. These two gentlemen had been my clients, though I did not represent them on this purchase. At the time of the purchase, the property was not designated as historic. After they bought it, the property. After they bought the property, a lady from a nearby neighborhood found out that they had applied for a permit to demolish the building. Their intent was to subdivide the site into four parcels and build four multi-million dollar custom homes. They were taking a chance trying to create a better life for their families. Their construction business was small, and this was the biggest project either of them had attempted. The lady filed an application to make the home historic. She just felt like it. She didn't put up the $1.5 million to purchase the land. She didn't risk everything. She just moved in on them and started the process of imposing a historic designation. She won and the home was designated historic. Her argument was that she felt like there were buyers out there who would purchase the home if it were remodeled. No data to back that up. No real information to go on. Just a feeling. My clients lost everything. Everything. They went into foreclosure on their personal homes. They had to sell their possessions to make ends meet. They lost their business. One of the gentlemen had adopted a daughter from China. He and his wife were planning on adopting a second child from China, but they had to put that off indefinitely. I keep in touch with them. They still haven't been able to adopt again. The fact of the matter is that using a hostile, historic designation to limit development is absolutely crushing to the unsuspecting homeowners who are most deeply affected by it. This is criminal and seems more like theft. If I could offer an alternate solution, it would be to establish a fund and pay fair market value for these homes. Nobody here is anti history. Everybody loves these old historic homes. Everybody wants to see them stay. But not at the expense of somebody whose entire future. I think there is a time and place for historic designations, and it is my personal opinion that the basis for the organization, for the landmark organization is a really good one. But using it as a mechanism to curb development shows how fundamentally flawed the law is. I am for preserving Denver's historic homes, but not at the expense of unsuccessful unsuspecting homeowners. Key word, unsuspecting. For example, the country club and driving park neighborhoods are both historic districts. They are neighborhoods that have been historic districts for years. Any buyer who purchases a home in those areas knows what they are getting into from the beginning. Further part of their decision to buy one of those areas, buy in one of those areas, apart from location and prominence, is probably the historic nature of the area. But what happens when an individual home is singled out to be designated historic without the prior consent of the homeowner? What happens when that homeowner wants to remodel their home? If they bought the house under the 100% correct assumption that the property was used by right then they could be planning an extensive remodel, an addition, a pop top, an expansion, or even a tear down for new construction. The remodel cost 2 to 3 times as much as they have to conform to landmark guidelines, and the project becomes all but impossible if they want to do a pop up or new construction. Then this unsuspecting homeowner can no longer afford to build value in their home, so they try to sell it. But now the property is stigmatized because no one else wants to take on a historic project, at least not at full market value. Plenty of people would do it at a discount. The result is that the market value of the home drops until the cost of the remodel doesn't price you out of the neighborhood. Thus causing financial ruin for the unsuspecting homeowner who was saddled with this burden against his or her will. More often than not, a home is the single biggest investment in a person's lifetime. Something they work incredibly hard to attain, something they sacrifice for in order to build equity and create a life. Imagine having all that taken away from you against your will and by your own government. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Cannon. Brant Wheatley. Good evening. My name is Bernice Weekley. I'm the owner of the home. Three doors to the east of 28, 49 West 23rd Avenue. I'm speaking in favor of landmark landmark designation of the property in addition to the. Property, meaning all three criteria for designation, including history, architecture and geography. I'd like to offer my reasons for supporting the designation. The home at 2827 West 23rd Avenue has been in my family for more than 65 years. It was built in 1906, 51 years ago. My parents announced their engagement in that home and they're still married today. I'm proud to say of the home's history is important. Who lived in it is important. My family has seen Jefferson Park evolve over the years drastically. Some positive, some negative. But one constant has been the presence of a handful of well preserved homes. Surrounding Jefferson Park. The home at 2849 West 23rd Avenue is one of those. Crown jewels of the neighborhood. There are. Only 7 to 7 or eight old. Homes around the park that remain, and only a few of them are well preserved. And this is one of them. I'm in the process. Of exploring the option of applying for landmark designation of my home and give my word that I will do so if this home is also preserved. As a homeowner, I recognize the difficulty of balancing property owners rights while. Still preserving our history. In this case, I urge you to vote for the historic preservation of the neighborhood treasure. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Weekly. All right. Joshua Duran should be Maribel. Okay, Maribel. Where's the. Oh, there it is. Yeah. I got. Thank you. My name is Maribel Salgado. I'm the owner on the 28th, and I was 22 when you were my neighbor. My neighbors situations made me very sad. I don't think this is fair. The shoes. We're not able to sell their house. To think that I could be in the same situation, it made me really feel scared. If someone could oppose to let me sell my house, I. No be able to make my dreams come out. Come true. Makes me feel sad. I want to help our timing. My husband and I deserve our retirement. I think everyone has their eyes. And their eyes should be respect. It is. No rice. Like one council man can take our rights away. Please. But not please, Judy. Thank you, Mr. Governor. All right, everyone, call up the next five speakers. Joshua Duran. Theresa Barnes. Ryan DeFranco. Kathleen Rowland. And Jessica Alice Alizadeh. Joshua Duran. Joshua Duran, your first. Thank you for your time. My name is Joshua Duran. I'm a sixth generation native of Colorado. We've lived in Denver my whole life. And I want to make the point that Rafael Espinoza did bring this up as a single councilman, but he brought this issue to the table on behalf of the people he represents, which is northwest Denver. I take offense to the comment that was said earlier that was said she took a chance on an unsafe neighborhood and waited for the neighborhood to mature. As someone who grew up in the north side of northwest Denver and still lives and works in the northwest Denver community, it is my community changes and it changes inevitable . And I personally welcome change, but not at the wholesale destruction of a community, culture and history. I'm concerned because many of these changes have come at the expense of the very people who have made this community and city so great by people who are not native to Colorado or to the city. I am concerned that our history is being scraped by people who have no investment or interest in this community beyond monetary gain. I support preserving the Voice House because we have already lost too much of our history to this new development. A quick little side note. I've been witness to families who have been pushed out of their communities, businesses forced to relocate or close, historical landmarks scraped and gone forever. My best friend's grandmother has owned the house on 44th and Tennyson for almost 70 years. Her son recently purchased it for her from her. She can no longer maintain it. The whole back yard has been a garden every summer for decades. Last year, to the north and to the south of their house, two three story seven unit block buildings were built there now. These buildings now block the sun in probably a garden will not grow this summer. But whose concern is certainly not the developers or the people who have moved in or anyone who has gained monetarily. Again, I reiterate I am concerned because I feel this is being done with no concern for the community. The people they have displaced. And especially without concern for the history and its historical value. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Durham. Theresa Barnes. My name is Traci Barnes. I'm a fourth generation Denver ite. I own an interior design firm in Denver, Colorado. And I'm I'm here to speak tonight because of an unfortunate situation I've recently had with a client that was remodeling in the Denver Country Club neighborhood. I felt very fortunate to be on a project like that with a very respected design build group. The project became so financially out of control by the designated restrictions that they had and guidelines we had to follow. We felt like we designed the best house we could for these clients, and everyone has spoken to the money side that it doesn't matter. Well, it does. To people who invested and this was a young woman at one time that invested and now that was her nest egg. The numbers don't work on the home. She was told then she could sell the home. Someone would buy the house. The house is out on the market. It has not sold now. She couldn't afford the remodel. I feel so bad for this family there. They took the house off the market because it wasn't selling. They're now renting another property so that they thought they were going to be able to follow through. The banks couldn't loan the funds needed. And there's so many unknowns on a property when you're remodeling them and no one seems to understand that those those are unknown. So she didn't even know what the remaining of her property was going to cost. And being a Denver, I do care about historic preservation. I care about how our city looks. But how do we feel about having one home that everyone is saying is going to look really fabulous and somebody is going to buy it from this woman and that they're going to do a great job? Well, if you look at the front of some of these homes and this is what I care about is a dump, right? That if you look at the back rear ends of these homes, they're eyesores. And do we really want a house sitting in Denver that everyone said they could repair when they really can't? And then we it becomes a creepy old house that has not been maintained. And we're a vibrant city. And that's why people are moving here and all the developers are doing a great job. There's enough restrictions on them and we should allow Denver to grow in the right places and preserve where it's needed. But financially it doesn't work for everyone. So I feel really bad for the families that I've worked for. I feel fortunate to have the opportunity. But please consider too that these houses could become become eyesores. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Barnes. Ryan DeFranco. Good evening. Counsel. My name is Ryan DeFranco. I've been a resident city of Denver for the past eight years and by no means a native, but by those that have been here for two years. Absolutely a native. I currently reside in Jefferson Park in District one and I own two businesses in District nine. I most recently have come across this article in the Denver Post regarding the regarding the hostile designation of the House at 2849 West 23rd Avenue. I stand here expressing great concern for the process at hand for two reasons. One, as a future homeowner, as I am currently in the process of looking to buy my first home, it concerns me deeply that this could happen to me. I do not see my first house would be my dream house as I am. A lot of us probably don't see that as well, but I definitely wouldn't purchase a house that it would not be a financial investment. That's a scary thought moving forward, especially. As I look at neighborhoods. Like Jefferson Park, which are not. Designated historical neighborhoods for a future resident. And number two, as a business owner of two restaurants, we are definitely looking to expand because as you already know, with expansion, I hope to better my financial future. I'm not just working 16 hour days for fun. Currently, we're looking in rhino and highlands neighborhoods for a new space. But what scares me is if I find a space and we we continue to be successful, I will. The same thing happen to me if I want to expand my business in the future, one of these neighborhoods that does have quite a bit of historical significance . So overall, as a business owner and a future homeowner, is it really okay for someone to determine my livelihood and my financial well-being as well as the same as Judith Battista? So in regards to the hostile designation, I ask you to reject it of this property. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. DeFranco. Kathleen Roemer. Hello, council members. I'm Kathleen. Roland and I live in District four 3695, East Dartmouth Avenue in Ms.. Parks District. I am reading on behalf of Matt Ruland. Matt Ruland lives in District one at 2129 Clay Street, Denver 80202. He also owns property in District nine at 3100 here on Street, Denver. He sent this message tonight because he's concerned with the use of historic designation within his neighborhood and citywide. Speaking for him in quotation, I do not wish wish to question the motives behind this specific application for historic designation, but I am concerned that it has been and will continue to be used as a tool to obstruct development that some believe is unwanted. The use of historic designation has an important role in our city and should only be used to protect those structures that are truly historic. A higher threshold should be obtained when dealing with a hostile, historic designation. We should not allow its use to be watered down for the sake of altering development that some do not like through. The development is not only legal, but desired by so many others in our city. Legal or legal or not, a holistic, historic designation and a form of regulatory condemnation and should be used with caution. If approved, tonight's historic designation would impose restrictions on the property rights of a Denver taxpayer against her wishes and likely diminish diminishing the property value. At the same time, let's be clear what the ultimate result will likely be for historic designation of a property that is not truly historic. The cost of reservation or renovation for this current property and many other homes that may be deemed to be historic will make it so that the property is not renovated any time soon and will instead continue to deteriorate and become an eyesore in the Jefferson Park neighborhood. As well-intentioned as this application may be. This is not the proper way to address the underlying concerns that I believe are trying to be addressed. There can be legitimate discussions to be had around the density and form of and form of much of the new development that is occurring in many neighborhoods throughout Denver, including Jefferson Park. However, forcing a historic designation on a property against the property owners wishes is something that should only be reserved for the most significant of historic properties . And I believe this property falls well short of that threshold. Thank you on behalf of Matt ruined. Thank you. That's really Jessica Alexander. Good evening and thank you. Members of Council Jessica, Liza, Ray. I'm here on behalf of Judith Battista. I would echo. The sentiments that were offered to you. By my colleague Matthew Rourke in a. Letter that was committed to the. Record. That's before you. I believe. You've had ample time to review that, and I won't take council's time with anything in regards to that. Letter. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Solicitor. All right. We have five more speakers live. Olivia Salgado. Some of these names we weren't able to get. And so we'll give you your the address. Is that correct? Madam Secretary. You've got two locked in. There's two locked and. Oh, okay. I see there's two Steve locked. And once you both just come up. Let's see. And then we got to Matt Richland on Clay Street and Joe Barrett as well. Come on up. All right. First is Elvia Salgado. Hello. My name is Elias Salgado. I have been living in Jefferson Park area since I was born. That's almost 27 years, or at least 27 years. I have seen the neighborhood the neighborhood go through a lot of changes, some good, some bad. My father is the owner of the house of a house right in front of Jefferson Park at 2839, West 23rd Avenue. I have seen my dad work long days and nights to pay off that house. There were even times I didn't get to see my dad until the weekend because he would leave off to work before I would wake up and come home after I was already in bed. All this to have his small piece of the American dream. When I heard about our neighbor situation, I thought to myself, What if this happened to my father? What if he was trying to sell his home to get a bigger house or to cash in his retirement and finally be able to relax? And what if he was limited to whom to sell the house because he was doing what? The historic status that he did not request. This would mean that all his sweat and tears, all the sacrifices he had to make and that we had to make to own a house would be for nothing. With the historic status, the owner would be limited on what to do with their own home, and anything they would want to do to their own home would cost a lot of money. You would have a sort of rule book on what to do with something you own. I don't think this is fair. If it is your property, you should be able to do whatever you pleased with it. If our house was a public building, I could understand this because saving history is important. But the rules should be different for private houses. I was confused when the real estate agent, Lisa Reyes, showed up at our house November 15 and started asking questions about my dad's house. The agent told me that Councilman Espinoza sent her to my dad's house because he thought that our real real estate agent was going to screw us over. And he wanted to make sure that my family could speak to to an agent that spoke Spanish. We are very private people, and talking to a stranger about my family scares me. This kind of harassment and abuse should not be allowed. How can this even happen? So I ask on behalf of me and my family to try and make this right and vote no against the historic designation of our private houses. Thank you, Mr. Gallo. The first Steve locked in their lives on union. Steve's my husband. He had to go be with our family. I'm Samantha. Okay. Madam Secretary. That's it. That's all right. Good. Thank you. My husband and I own a business at 1600 East 17th and. We're afraid by the scared of this arbitrary process that can randomly take someone's net. Worth and. Nest egg for no legitimate reason. What prevents the same thing from happening to us and our family? This is a dangerous precedent of governmental abuse and overreach. This process needs to be amended, and it did not meet the three criteria adding one at the last minute. How does that even work? Councilman Espinosa should be ashamed of his harassing behavior. If Councilman Espinosa values this home so much, he could. Pay for the. Reservation renovations and maintenance out of his own pocket. Because a single woman working two jobs can't afford it. I don't know how he is even allowed to put this whole thing in motion and then sit up here with all of his fellow councilmen and vote no. I'm sorry. And vote for it. It doesn't even make sense. And I'm shocked that it's allowed. I think everyone in this room should be shocked that that's allowed as well. Please vote no against this. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Lockton. So Steve will not be. Okay. Steve had to go. Just making sure. Okay. Matt Rich. Matt Richland on K Street. Play Street. Okay. Uh, Joe, bury it. Oh, that's you. Okay. To get back. To our studies. Go ahead. Why don't you introduce yourself again? My name is Joe Barrett. I live in District ten in the very charming old Congress Park neighborhood. I come before you to express my concern about what a slippery slope this can be. If a hostile designation can be made. On a historic house. My house is very old. And when we bought it, very charming. But is now getting quite expensive to maintain repairs. And I can only imagine how much more expensive those would be with this type of designation. So please vote no on this. And thank you for having me. Thank you, Miss Bear. Sorry for messing up your name. The last three can come to the front bench and you all can have a seat. Dale Chandler, Amy Zimmer and Matt Burke. You each have 3 minutes and Dale Chandler, you will be first. Thank you. I'm not a public speaker, so I hope I don't stumble over myself here. But my name is Dale Chandler. I live in South Denver. I own some property on River Drive, so it's within this district. I was I was raised in North Denver, an alumni of North High School guys. So. I don't know how much I can really add to this whole conversation. It seems like it's been pretty well covered and I'm given the alternatives presented by Bussey and I think his story. Denver I don't see how this thing can possibly pass this evening, but I want to firmly come down on the side of Judith. Against hostile landmark preservation designations seems to be of everybody in this whole room that has any skin in the game. She's the only one that has any skin in the game. And if this is such a big deal to the city or to the historic Denver, to whoever else, Rafael, they got to get skin in the game . They can buy it themselves. Or there is such a thing as eminent domain. You know, if it's really that important to the city of Denver, they can go through the process of eminent domain and take the property on themselves. So thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. Chandler. Amy Zimmer. Good evening, council members. I am here as a member of the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission. As you heard, we voted unanimously in our hearing to designate or to forward this possible designation to you. We are a commission that is made up of professionals. We include four professional architects, a landscape architect, general contractor, two professional historians. So we are people that we know, the buildings in Denver, we know our architecture and history. And we, as I said, unanimously, we ask you to vote for this property. A couple of the things that were brought up were the geography criteria that was added on in the last minute, that was actually brought by myself and our landscape architect on the board. The two of us felt that we the best this being at and the prominent hill above Jefferson Park and a very recognizable structure made it fit in the criteria for geography and we are as landmark commission members were well within our legal purview to do that. As a city attorney can speak to you. Furthermore, I just some of the other things that have been addressed regarding there was some information about the homeowner asserting that if her home was designated historic, it would cost more to renovate. And that is absolutely not true. In fact, one thing that has not been brought up but is absolutely true is that we're here. Her home designated as historic. She would be eligible for historic state tax credits on the renovations done to her property. So she would actually be getting money back rather than spending more money. So it actually would be in her benefit to have this home is historically designated. And like Ms.. Batiste, I am also a single woman homeowner. I own a century old house in Park Hill. And, you know, the thing is, when you buy a historic home, you know that it's going to have thousands of dollars that are going to have to be put into it. And so, you know, here we are all sitting here because a homebuyer did really did not do her homework and did not think about what it was going to cost to own one of these houses. And now our community is suffering the loss of a very historic property that having its association with Birnam Hoyt, you know, breadbox, everybody knows Red Rocks and how, you know, for an employee growing up in this house, how do we know that the sort of amphitheater type design of Jefferson Park didn't influence his ideas for Red Rocks? You know, I think just because he wasn't born here, it's absolutely significant in the history of the white brothers. So based on all these criteria, I ask you to please consider the well-thought opinions of professional architects and historians, and please designate this home as historic. It would be very tragic to lose this. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Zimmer. Met my client. Jack. Okay. So. So. So you can have. You can have a seat. And now we're going to call up Matt Burke. We're in a formal public hearing. You can't just this map are you remember? No. Is Matt Burke here? Okay. Now, this. This concludes all of our public speakers. Thank you all for being patient and sitting through this. We now have questions by members of council. Okay. Councilman Espinosa is. Shooting Adam Hernandez or David, who's handling the questions from the city attorney's office. David Broadwell, Assistant City Attorney. It depends on the question. And so Adam is here tonight as our expert on the LPC ordnance, but there may be some questions appropriate for me. So we will determine based upon the questions we might get asked. So I have you know, I want to I want to address some of the claims that Mr. Roarke had stated. He stated that designation prevents an owner a right to sell or develop, or is an owner allowed to sell their property with the designation? Adam Hernandez, assistant city attorney. There's no prohibition on the sale of property once it's designated. If a structure on a parcel is is designated, is the balance of that property or even the house itself, you know, can it be developed? Can you repeat that question for them? It says the designation prevents the right to develop, he stated. Can the parcel with the designated part, with a designated structure be developed. When a property is designated? Any time it comes in for basically a zoning or building permit, it would go through a design review process. So provided that there isn't any zoning prohibition and it's actually developable, the property is developable per the zoning in areas that aren't occupied by a structure, that portion would then be developable. Is that correct? Depends on the property. It depends on the property. It depends on what's designated. I believe in this case the parcel is designated. So that would be the. The. Area. That would be subject to design review should. A building permit or a zoning permit be required for anything proposed. So it could be developed. But the development has to go through design review. Correct. Okay. There was another two. There was somebody else that testified that you couldn't remodel. I believe it was. Mr. Cannon, can a historic designated structure be remodeled? Again. Any zoning for any. Any construction or development that would require a zoning or building permit for the. Exterior work of the structure would have. To go through design review. So if you're talking about work that would be done inside the structure, that would not be subject to LPC design review. Okay. And then the last thing is, is there was a lot of things just comments about how an owner with designation is somehow compelled to upgrade the structure. Is the designation does the designation require upgrading or is it designated as is? It's designated as is. But there is a requirement in Chapter 30 that you do maintain the structure. You can't let the structure deteriorate. So the windows that are currently on the structure, as long as they are prohibiting the entry of the elements, do they have to be replaced? I'm sorry. Can you repeat that question? The windows that are currently on the structure. As long as they maintain the, you know, keep the elements outside of the building and keep them from deteriorating in the structure. Do they have to be replaced in any way, shape or form? No, they're not required to be replaced. If the structure was designated and new windows were proposed, that would have to go through the design review process review. But there is no neces there's not that does not necessarily predicate any level of of. You know, that doesn't presume what style of window or what would be allowed. It has to go through that design review process. Correct. Any window replacement would have to go through a design review process. I don't know exactly what the design review guidelines would say, but I would have to go through the process. So just to clarify. Any window replacement in the city or county of Denver also has to get a permit. Correct? That I'm not sure. I think it's only four designated. Structures or structures that are in districts for preservation. I think it's an exception in the building code. Okay. Um. Councilman? Yes. You have more questions. There's several folks in the queue. Sure. I just wanted to clarify the sort of the statement so that people understood. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. Is Brant Weekley still here? Could you come up to the microphone? And correct me if I wrote down the wrong name. There were a lot of people speaking tonight, but I think it was you who said that you were considering you have a property, a couple of houses down and you're considering applying for landmark preservation of your properties. Correct? Yes. At the end, I thought you said you would. You're only considering that if this one does not get preserved. No. If this is preserved, I would do it. Yeah. Why would you not preserve it if it's not? Because I don't plan on selling it. I don't plan on tearing it down. So I'm just trying to do anything I can to help preserve the neighborhood and what's left. So I guess my question is, why wouldn't you preserve it either way? Why the distinction of you would or wouldn't based on the outcome of this? I was confused about that. Well, because I'm going to keep the home regardless, you know, for the foreseeable future. So like I said, it's been in my family for 65 years. So, you know, I don't know that it needs to, but I'm definitely willing to do that if it would help this cause. I'm not sure that completely answers my question, but I've asked it a couple of different ways and we're not getting traction. Yeah, I mean, I just yeah. I'm not sure what you're feeling. You know, if if it should be preserved, it should be preserved. But you're saying you you might not because you don't intend to leave for a long time. So you wouldn't need to. Is that right? Okay. All right. Thank you very much. I mean. It wouldn't be it wouldn't be in danger of being torn down. Okay. Got it. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilman Clarke. Councilman Neal? Yes? This petition I can ask you questions was. How long have you own the property? Since 2007. And when you bought the property, did you understand the historic nature of the house when you bought it? Absolutely not. I mean, just from the look of it, it didn't look historic to you or. You know, it never crossed my mind. Okay. Never at all. Okay. Did you have a question, too, about the offers made on your home? You know, and I know that Mr. Charlie Willie is a very prominent developer and citizen. And. And were you made aware of offers? And he was making an offer on your home? No. His name ever came up. Okay. Well, thank you very much. Rick, may I speak to the real estate broker, please? Can you can you answer the question about Mr. Willey? Did you contact you and. Can you. Describe what happened on that conversation? There were numerous people that contacted me regarding the offers. The precedents were set by my client regarding to collecting all offers together so she could evaluate all offers in a non-biased situation. There was no time set for the stamp in terms of the overall date when that stopped. I have received no offers regarding any of that from anyone. So the conversations they saw you, Mr. Willey's conversation with you about that, you didn't have to you had to have a formal offer before you presented something to the owner. Absolutely. Because there's nothing about a conversation. There was no verbal offer. There was no any no written offer at all. So you didn't tell her about any of the phone calls that you had about offers that you had about people who were interested? No. In terms of the precedents were set, I can only give my offer that my client what I have in my hand if I don't have an offer. Okay. So you just. Said you didn't have a written offer. You just didn't tell the client about any conversations about that. I've told her about conversations, but I don't have a written offer. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Sure. Let me ask the question of the designer for coach. Yes, please. Think I'm sorry. I forgot your name. I'm sorry. My name is Teresa. Thank you. I'm just concerned about your situation as well. Says coach clubs in my district. I know the area very, very well and I know they have a very strong zoning committee that does a lot of historic preservation work and making sure that owners are very aware of what has to be done. Did your owner not know about the historic criteria and and did she work with. Yes, they did know. And I was, like I said, very fortunate to work with a very prominent, well-respected design build group and architecture they have in house architecture. But the house these homes need so much work. And she designed it the best she could and was putting a lot of money into it. And from January, until we rebuild the house for building, she had already leased a house thinking it was going to be at the same price. It it increased 400,000 in remodel costs and that was with going through. I had to go through all the finishes, take them down many levels. And then it became, what do we knock off the house? And we kept on knocking it down, not taking off, you know, remodeling the garage. And we were going to end up with a property that was not going to be economically feasible to sell to. She looked at spending the money and then flipping the house, and that wasn't feasible. I even brought in three investors that could afford to remodel the house and they walked away from it. They said the numbers just didn't make sense. And so it was really more about the cost of remodeling the home rather than affecting the extra structure that would. And it was following the guidelines, we had to follow the guidelines and she ended up with a house in addition that she said, even if I had the money, this house doesn't work it it doesn't work for a modern family right now. Right. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilman, new councilman Flynn. You're up. Thank you, Mr. President. Kara. Can I ask you a couple of questions? And while you're on your way up, I'm looking at the presentation and it looks like over 610, 615 this year. Applications for demolition that were reviewed and 580 said were reviewed without posting. What I have not been able to find in the staff report or in the presentation is when you review those 600 demolition applications, what criteria do you use? You don't use the same ones for land market, do you? We do so. So when we get a demolition or certificate of non historic status, we do a the same review for every property. And so we look at it against the history criteria, the architecture criteria and the geography criteria. And we have a checklist that we go through that we look at each one kind of basically exactly the same, same process. Okay. So it's sort of a preliminary high level cut at the very same criteria you presented us with tonight. Okay. And then on on Slide ten, not the you have to go there. The R.A., those that were notified, maybe this is just a mistake on the slide, but they're all in the Capitol Hill and City Park. Cheesman Park, Colfax, Bida was J. Jefferson Park. United neighbors notified of this? They were. I apologize. That must be a typo on my pardon. But yes, they're all the registered neighborhood organizations within 200 feet of the property. I apologize. That must be an error on my part when I put it in the park. Okay, so this is probably from another president. Sorry. Okay. I was wondering why they were all notified about that. Do do you know or does maybe Annie Levinsky if she's still here? How many structures designed by Burnham Hoyt exist in Denver? And how many are landmarked versus not landmarked? Do we have an inventory of that? I have a I have a preliminary list of the properties that he has designed. And. It's 30 ish at least. So I noticed that one. One that surprised me in your presentation. It's not landmarked was the fourth Church of Christ scientist up there on Speer. Yeah, it is wonderful geographic. It's, you know, iconic building. And it's not landmarked. No, no, it is not landmarked. Okay. Is that probably because the owner didn't bring it forward or it's not in danger of demolition or anything like. I believe we have an answer. Ms.. Levinsky, you to come on. Okay. Thanks. I believe that building is on the National Register of Historic Places and it's protected by a covenant with history. Colorado. Excellent. Do we know who the architect is caring for this house that we're talking about tonight? No, we do not. I could not find it. And I don't believe that the applicant could find it within the building records because it was built so early that Denver permits aren't always easy something. Yeah. Okay. Do we did we know that that Birnam Hoyt grew up in this house before this? Because I can't find it. I did some Wayback Machine Internet sleuthing and I didn't see any reference prior to this application that this was ever known as his house. It wasn't information that I knew prior to when the certificate of non historic status came in and then doing the research found that he had resided there. I'm sorry, it was not. Or it was. I was not aware of it prior to the certificate coming in and me doing the research for it. Okay. And then just one more. The staff report said that Birnam Hoyt is known to have designed properties while living in a house, and then he moved out to New York in 1907 or 1908. He would have been 19 years old. Were you talking about that? He designed houses after he returned in 1919, or are you saying he designed he buildings while he was there? Before he left for New York? He was a draftsman while he was an apprentice. Yeah, right. And then he went to New York and he continued his architectural study and he came back and lived in the house and designed most of these that were shown here. Do you know if it was ever his office? No, I do not believe that it was. Thank you. And one last question for Judith Battista. In your presentation, you said that you disagreed with the staff report, that there was evidence that that he had lived there for as many years as the applicant had claimed. Do you have what's your basis for that? There was actually an article that stated that he he traveled between New York and Europe right after World War or whatever. I'm trying to think World War One, the first one. So, yeah. So for the war to end all wars. Exactly. But as far as that was concerned, you know, we didn't have planes back then. So if he was traveling between those other places, I would think it would take him a little longer to be there. Okay. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilman Flynn. Councilman Lopez, you're up. Thank you. You can come back up, sir. I think you Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you just a few questions on some of the numbers with the historical repair costs. I'm just wondering, the sewer line replacement, $45,000. Can I get my sheet? Do you mind? Yeah. Yeah, please. I just. I'm just wondering about these figures. They have some extra ones up here. A few. My my my question is, is three things. I mean, with the sewer line replacement, the historic windows. And then the removal of tree for the sewer and water line. So for the first time I just on the repair costs. $25,000 seems pretty steep for a sewer line repair. Now, is this only because I'm used to hearing about this in my area, my neck of the woods just south and in west Denver? Typically, they run, you know, 11 to 15, sometimes 16,000. But I've never heard I mean, that's on the high. That's not very high. And we have that old clay pipe that's breaking and people sewers are back and usually sets people back. So I totally get that. Where does $45,000 come from? Okay. So for the first one, they quoted me if I just went into the street and because 23rd Avenue, West 23rd Avenue. Correct. We would have to actually close that street. And because it's two double yellow lines, we would actually have to have flagged people to be there to actually direct traffic. And that's just for the repair in front of my property. And yes, it is the original clay pipe as well. And because of the distance and because it's up on a hill, they would actually try to save the tree because they're worried that they would have to go and get another permit from city. So they would be digging it out underneath the tree and also underneath the retaining wall to hopefully save that. But there was no guarantees as far as the tree. So they were talking about because the sewer line was so long and then they also were not sure because they could not get past an area in the sewer to actually go all the way to the city line. Is a broken now is it collapsed now? There we are. There is a area that is in question. Yes. That they could not get past. Okay. And then the the historic windows. How many windows is that? How many windows do you have in your home? I believe that 6000. I think there's 16. Okay. And unfortunately, when I bought the house, I had accurate our access windows. Was the person or the company that put them in before I moved into the house. So the previous owner put them in and unfortunately there was no warranty to them because it was one of those things that they did it in a barter. But every single one of my windows have popped and actually shattered on the inside of the house throughout the years. Okay. And so I had an expert, Paula, windows come out and they're the ones that gave me the bid for both historic and non historic. To find out what I was getting myself into. Just. If you can stay right there. I just wanted to ask a question on on historic designation. If if if somebody replaced the windows before the current property owner. And let's say it was the property owner before, does that have to be restored after the fact by the current property owner? Does that. I mean I mean, anybody from historic Denver or whoever knows the rules. I mean, let's let's in her case, does she have to restore it to the original status? No, those those were replaced prior to the designation. If she if if the structure were to be designated and Mrs. Batiste at that point wanted to replace the windows, then they would have to go through the design review process. But she does not is not required to replace them after the fact. Okay. All right. On back to the sewer. I'm just trying to figure out. I mean, I definitely get the. We're at the cost issue right now and an older home. Go back to the sewer line. They also recommend, because I know this happened in my district, there's not very many 100 year old buildings. And if there are, they're kind of you know, they're shoeboxes, they're like double wides that somebody put a couple of a couple of you know, I don't even think they're 100 years old yet. But with wood, there was one case where there was an older building in our on our neck of the woods where they actually didn't recommend digging it up, where they actually put a sleeve. It's an epoxy sleeve that goes in. It's a resin sleeve. They recommend that on older homes without having to destroy that. Were you able to look at getting that done instead? I actually I asked the gentleman that I had come out and he did not recommend it because he felt that that process is somewhat of a Band-Aid. And it is actually quite expensive to do as well. Okay. It's usually cheaper. Thank you, miss. Thank you, Mr.. I appreciate you giving me the insight. I. Can I just say one thing? I didn't say that it was more expensive. I just said that it was still costly. No, I'm not insinuating that. I'm just. I was just asking questions only because he's seen these. The numbers seem really high. Okay. I mean, you can call Applegate. I'm not a professional. I'm not here by any means. Sorry. Okay. I think. Thank you. Guzman-Lopez We're going to go to Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. I have a question for Nathan Adams. So earlier, Jerry Olson mentioned the Andersen house and how you resold the property. For much more money than you purchased for. Can you explain why it became more valuable? Sure. Jerry likes to leave off many of the facts. We contracted the property from Jim almost a year prior, actually 14 months prior to us closing. We did substantial work. We spent almost $500,000 on entitlements. A good bit of that was attorneys defending Jerry's property rights architects, structural engineer, civil engineers. We did a phenomenal amount of work and time and effort. My staff probably spent close to $1,000. We did profit off the sale we were forced to sell. We no longer had a bank loan. When we finally got through the process of coming here and having to defend Jim's property rights. Jim's aware of what we sold the property for. He's completely okay with it. Jerry's making an attempt at stating that my company made substantially more than we really did. But we did make a profit, and we did. We did close on the property. We did sell it a short time later to a longtime client of ours. Now. Do you think the property would have sold for that same amount had it been landmarked? No chance it would have sold for that and no chance I would have sold for that without the entitlement. Work that we did. Okay. Thanks. You're welcome. I have a question for Karen. On page eight, there is a pie chart that says 580 reviewed demolition applications without posting. Can you give us some examples of what those 580. Permits were for. Yes. So those were all of the demo applications that are demo or certificates of non historic status applications that we received. They vary from, you know, small bungalows or classic cottages to properties that are, you know, not historic at all and are not too particularly old. We do a lot of work in Wash Park. We end up with a lot of bungalows there. We have them in bulk, Kyra. We have them in Park Hill. We have probably a disproportionate number within District one. Are they only houses or are they there's there's some there's there's commercial buildings as well. It's primarily residential, but there are commercial buildings as well. So on Colorado Boulevard, there's a gas station that was built in 1975 and they're going to tear it down. It has to have a demolition permit. Yes, it would go through the demolition process. And landmark is just basically the first step through the city process for demolition review. So for 2016 out of those five. Well, actually, it was more than 580, so it was 613 33. You guys that were worthy of posting. Yes. Only to. Those two went through design review, which is a kind of a different process. So it just kind of throws the proportion off. That's like someone demolishing 40% of their roof into it goes through the entire design review process. So it's a little separate from this, but they were part of our official numbers. Okay. Thank you. Is that Councilwoman Black? Okay, Councilwoman Gilmore, you're up. Thank you, Mr. President. Kara, if you could. I didn't catch you before you went and sat down. Could you talk a little bit about how big your staff is and the resources that you utilize through the city to work on a project such as this? So there is. There's myself. And four other staff members. So there are three of us, primarily, maybe four of us who do demolition and certificate of non historic status review. It takes anywhere from, you know, on a property that does not have integrity. That's basically the first step we look at. Does it have integrity? It'll take, you know, an hour or so to process that on something like this. This entire process has been hundreds of hours. And then do you also engage folks from the city attorney's office, or is that part of the five folks that you reference? No, that would be outside of our landmark group. And occasionally occasionally we'll we'll we'll bring them in if we have a question. Typically not if we're doing a demolition certificate of non historic status review if it goes further than that. So something like this, Adam and I are in fairly constant communication. Okay. All right. So it would be fair to assume that there's five folks within your immediate office and then at least one city attorney. Yes. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Annie Levinsky. Same question. How big is your staff and the amount of resources that that go into a project such as this? So we have I believe we have six staff members at Historic Denver. And then, as you know, we own and operate the Molly Brown House Museum. So they have five staff members who do that work exclusively. We don't formally conduct demolition review. We respond to the postings. We evaluate them with our volunteer board. So it's primarily myself and one other staff member who work just reviewing these answering questions from the public, you know, preparing comments if we're going to come to a meeting like this. Sure. And then you had referenced in your earlier testimony that you were trying to work on getting some buyers for the property. So is that outside of your six staff members that engage folks who might want to purchase a property such as this? Yeah. So in that case, I made phone calls to people that I know who are, you know, developers who do projects like this. And mentioned to them that we were hoping to find someone who might be willing to do this and and encouraged them to look at the property and to get in touch with with this Batiste's broker. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Ms.. Amy Zimmer. Same question. The amount of resources that from your organization that go towards working on a project such as this. Sure. So we have there are nine members on the Limerick mission. We do work with Kira's staff, those five people and city attorney. Their staff will prepare the they they they're the one that said, do the initial research and then they prepare a recommendation for us based on what they interpret it to, whether it fits the criteria or not. And then that the professionals on the commission are tasked with determining the final decision on that. A lot of times we agree with them. We don't always it's not always a given. But in this case, we did agree with staff that this property had historic significance. Okay. You had made an earlier comment that so, Miss Battista, and not to dispute numbers back and forth, but Ms.. Battista had an estimate that it would be approximately 100,000 for historic repairs. That might be high. That might be low. But let's just work with 100,000. You made the comment that she would actually get money back if she designated her home through tax credits. Could you explain that a little bit more? And approximately, if we're working with around number of 100,000, what would you estimate that she would receive back in tax credits? So the the program I was referring to is it's a state program done through the State Department of Revenue, and it is a historic tax credit, which is for specifically for historically designated buildings. So just any building that happens to be old is not qualify for historic tax credits. It has to be designated historic in order to get those. And then so that's what I was referring to, why it would be a benefit to her as far as the is the exact numbers. I don't actually know those. Somebody from the city staff would be better to to give you the exact numbers and percentages. Okay. Thank you. So thank you for for that information. So, Cara, could we go ahead and have you. Come back up and again working on a round number of 100,000. What would be the estimate with your experience that Ms.. Battista would receive back? It's a 20% tax credit for allowable expenses, which are basically expenses that work on the historic fabric of the building, which also includes sewer work within the footprint of the building, HVAC work, repair, rehab of windows, mortar work, anything that's on the historic fabric. It's a 20% tax credit from the state tax, from any taxes you owe to the state. Okay. So is that 20% credit? Is that after. Is that a reimbursable. So the property owner would be responsible for putting the money outright to get the repairs done and then it would be a tax credit credit that would be reimbursable. So the property owner would still have to come forward with the money upfront. The money would be upfront. And so if you couldn't take those state tax credits in one year, it's extended over a ten year period. But you would pay for the month, you would pay for it upfront and then take it on your taxes. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. Care, President Brooks. I would like Ms.. Battista to come up, and it's one question. Oh, yeah. Okay. Thank you, Ms.. Battista. Please. So, Miss Battista, could you talk a little bit about the folks that you have working with you and you know, that are helping you defend this? How many people have you had to engage through this process? Well, I actually I have one attorney firm as far as. So there's two people that are both working on it. And I guess my really I don't know if you're considering him part of the process, but it would be just those three. Okay. And you're responsible for taking care of their costs and everything out of your own pocket? Yeah, unfortunately. Okay. All right. Great. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thank you, President Brooks. And thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. We have Councilman Espinosa and NU and you guys have talked. I want to get the other folks in the queue, if that's okay. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. Annie Levinsky, please. Hi there, Annie. I heard a couple of people tonight talk about the fact that they thought the city should have some sort of a fund. To help make deals offset situations like this. Can you talk about that? Are you aware is that done in other cities that that that you're. You know, I don't I haven't heard of a as a really common tool. I do I've heard of a couple of times. I believe Phenix has a historic preservation fund. I forget what the source of the funds come from, but they do have a fund that they can use for a variety of discretionary purposes, and I know that they at least once have used it to purchase a property. That's the main example I can think of. I haven't done analysis on. I was just at the National Preservation Conference last week and it wasn't something that that came up with great frequency, but. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Yeah, thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I do have a couple of questions. Is Marilyn Quinn still here? She left, I believe. Okay. Mr. Olsen, will you come back up? I saw you jump up when questioned. Pardon me. You have to. Since this. Gentleman right here. From. China may have questions. For you. Later. Yes. You the younger one? Yes. So I wanted to ask you a question about the Anderson. Has it sort of in follow up to the question that was being asked by Councilwoman Black earlier? Yes, it's it's my recollection during that process or shortly thereafter that there actually had been some identified developers that had indicated a willingness to develop that property. If it had been designated and and maintained the structure. Do you do you have any. Knowledge of that. And so will you please share that? And I'll ask the other gentleman in a few minutes. The name of the developer who made the proposal was Steve Davis. And he made a proposal. It was a cash offer. Which included preservation of the Anderson House. And then there would have been development on the remaining land. 14 townhomes. He made an offer. Cash. $1,100,000. Okay. And then he. Went on down since we lost our vote. He went on down. And, you know, fortunately. He has a good reputation. And he's in the current stage of remodeling the Bosley House on Federal Boulevard just to the north. So the developer that is doing the property on what used to be the Anderson House. Yes. So the property was demolished, correct? Oh, yes. And how many units were put on that site, do you remember? Well, they're currently under construction. There are 18 units under construction. The distance between there are. Let me see. I think there's a total of six buildings. And the distance between each of the buildings is about eight feet. And then. You have nice concrete walkways. In between the buildings. Okay. All right. I have no further questions for you I want to ask. Thank you, Miss Hun. If you wouldn't mind coming back to the microphone. So getting back to the number of. Demolition request. So of the 613, do you know how many of those were actually torn down? I am believing probably most of them. If it's a demolition request, it's typically they're going to follow right through and get the permit after they've got landmark approval. For the most part, a lot oftentimes I'll I'll see that property are like on Google Earth and it'll be gone. So. And just to be clear about those that come before your office, it's not just any request for a demolition. It's those that happen to have some what people believe to be significant. Or is it. Every single. It's pretty much a coalition request. So basically anything that's demoed in the city, I see it. Okay. I end up doing I end up doing this. I'll look at it for any of the criteria that someone might believe to be able to meet sort of the the thrust behind the ordinance and whether or not. You know, the owner might be interested or that that's what triggers the process that led us to why we're here tonight. Right. So if we get a demolition or a certificate of non historic status, that's what triggers the triggers, that process. Great. Is Joel Judd still here? Did he leave? Okay. Let me see if I have some other questions. That is it for right now, Mr. President. Thanks. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. Mr. Adams. And then I'll follow that up with Maribel if she's still here. This Maribel's still here. Your mom's still here. No. She's not here. She's coming. So. How much value did your entitlement work add to Jim's property? Well, it's pretty clear we added a substantial amount of value. We were able to sell the property for a little over $2.2 million. So the entitlements added $1,000,000 in value. Okay. Now you have to subtract off the entitlements to actually get to the true profit of the deal. Okay. So over $500,000 for anybody that would like to know. So it was Jim's property assemblage. It was Jim's Ali vacation that came before council and it was Jim's certificate of non historic status. But you profited from that. My company played a role in all parts of that. The Ali vacation, the Certificate of Narnia star status. We were there every step of the way. We spent the dollars to make things happen. We hired attorneys. We did what we needed to do. Jim was well aware of that, and Jim could not have done what we did on his own. It would have been impossible for him. But once the vacation was done, it did have extreme value as as dirt, because the assemblage was then made complete that hit Jim's three parcels and then the vacated parcel that separated his parcels. Correct. Our contract was contingent on our successful vacation of the. Valley and we get those all the time. That's a $600 fee that anybody can do. All they have to do is go and ask. It was quite a cumbersome process, given the fact that we had opposition from yourself and a few other folks. So the. But Jim would not have had that opposition. You got that opposition because you claimed you told Jim that $1,000,000 was all his land was worth, when in fact it had always as an assemblage, it was worth quite more. Jim actually hired a real estate broker by the name of Michael Air. Jim and Mike set the price of the property and came to us. We merely agreed to pay Jim's asking price. So. So I think that's pretty fair. Yeah. Let's let's get off the exchange and try to. Well, you did not talk to the mayors. Ortega's comments and questions to this does talk to the merits of the deal here. Okay. But, I mean, there's always been a concern about whether the property owners are actually being taken advantage of by developers when they don't actually know the true value of what's going out, what their what they're subjecting themselves to. And that was sort of I mean, Mr. Adams spoke clearly to it, that there was a big, huge delta between the actions that council took and and and what the ramifications were to the future development of that property. Antalya, that property. Are you unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Jim hired a broker, a professional. And received representation? So so, Mr.. Let's just let's just do a question and answer. So what's the question? So you're you're a managing broker of a real estate firm, are you not? That's correct. Okay. So as when you have a listing contract and an offer is presented to you on behalf of the owner, should you respond or counter or just ignore. It's the owner's choice as to what to do. So you don't happen to know. Jim, I know that you stated that it was you did not believe that the $1.1 million offer was was valid or reasonable. I mean, real. Do you know if the his rep, his listing agent actually followed through with the counter? I did have a chance to review that offer. I happen to see it. I'm kind of shocked that I'm on trial here tonight. But. So, so. So also we need to we need to actions. I was not able to sit on this dais hearing that. Otherwise you would have. Councilman. Councilman Espinosa. Do you have a question? Okay. Yes. So I'm just. What was that question about? Yeah, it's just unfortunate because. Well, let's go back to Maribel. Yeah, I would like to speak to Maribel. Thank you, Mr. Adams. Miss Maribel. Did your property was your property property subject to a certificate of non historic status application. I know one answer. Any other question. Would your daughter like to speak? I think she understands the question. Yes. You call her. She's. Able to answer the question. Was your mother or your parents property subject to a certificate of non historic status. I think I don't have the answer for that. I'm sorry. Okay. But you owned the parcel adjacent. Your mother, your parent, your family owns the parcel adjacent to Judah's property. Correct. What was. That? Your parents owned the property adjacent to Judith's property? Yes, they do. Okay. And Judith filed an application for a certificate and on a story accessed in July of this year on that parcel. Is that correct? I'm not sure. I don't know that. Judith Carol. Let's let's have somebody. Sorry, what is the Judith file? An application for a certificate. Non historic status on her neighbors property. That yes there was a certificate of non historic status on that property. I was the one who actually did the review of that and issued the certificate. I believe that it was Judith who filed that, but I can't be 100% sure on that. Okay. The. Was was there an application for designation filed on that property? No, that property was not posted. We felt that it lacked the integrity. So it was not posted. So there was no designation application. Just I just want it clear that that the property adjacent to Judith is not encumbered by any certificate, mean any any designation, landmark designation and could be sold and the house could be demoed. Right away. Correct? Yes. Thank you. No further questions. Councilman, new quick question. If Levinsky looks. It was an intriguing idea about relocating historic houses brought up earlier tonight, or have the historic homes been relocated? Is that an issue that's that happens. It has happened from time to time. You know, notably happened for the Kirkuk Museum a few weeks ago. That was the first time in a really long time. But the Jestina Ford House, that is the black American West Museum was moved by historic Denver in 1980. And there are a number of other examples in Denver. So it can be done. And while it's generally not the number one preferred choice, it it can be an option and perhaps is here. Great. Thank you, Mr. Batiste. One last question I forgot to ask you before I'm sorry is about the relocation. Is this something that you have considered or have you discussed, or is this something that you would consider? This is the first it's ever been brought up to me, and I cannot answer that truthfully because I don't know pricing I don't know anything about. The process that you go through to do that. Okay. So it's just the first time you've heard about it tonight. But if it was financially feasible in some way to do that, then you wouldn't would you disagree with doing something like that with the House if it didn't affect you? Yeah. I mean, if it doesn't affect me financially. Sure. But I looking back, I. Yeah, I mean, I can't answer that. Okay. Thank you very much. Sorry. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman. No, and thank you for asking the question, because it was a I'm just going to invite Louis Bass if you come to the lectern. I was. Oftentimes in these situations where we have community issues, you know, there's folks on one side or the other. But you actually came up with the solution. And I really appreciate that because I probably can count on my hand so many times that's happened in one of these conversations. Do you know what the cost would be? Honestly, I do not. You know, I may be naive. I don't consider myself an angel in this project. Yeah. And this possibility, it. It was something that could be considered to solve both parties sufficiently. Do I get something out of it? Yeah, I get I would get a house, you know, and I've got the land and. Okay, house land. What are the costs? Okay. I've been out of architecture for three or four years. Maybe the number I threw out was naively low, but it's not out of the realm of consideration. How much would you be willing to put in on the deal? Well, I think I threw out the number of $200,000 now. What? That what does that cover? Well, I thought it would have to cover a new foundation. A new foundation? Citing the House. You'd have to upgrade, probably. And I don't know what the condition structurally is of the House. That would have to be determined, but you would probably have to upgrade the windows. You'd have to do electrical plumbing, sewer, tap, you know, but these things, these things I've seen in projects, I was in business for 30 years. Well, I don't know if anyone's going to take you up on the offer, but I sincerely thank you for offering up your land and trying to get a deal done. Well, not just for the community, but for the city. Well, the interesting thing is that I bought the house that I still owned on River Drive in the early eighties. It's an 1888 Queen Anne Cottage. And prior to anybody else living there, the master brewer for Zang Brewery, who came over from Germany, lived in that house for two weeks until his bigger house got built across the highway. It was a blue collar neighborhood. It was developed all by a girl investment company. And they would walk down to the river to go to work. And I've got a connection with River Drive for years. Decades, really? And would hate to see. Yeah. Housing stock disappear. Yeah. And this was a way of seeking to preserve something. Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Car, can you come up to the front? Thanks again, Mr. Bussey. I just I just had a quick question on the the geography. I know we we added the geography in the landmark commissioners. It was actually in the landmark designation application. So so it was in the initial designation application. I thought we just had a commissioner say that it was. It was it was in the application. It was, it was very short in the application. And so staff recommended that the designation as written was not sufficient. So my staff report initially said that it was significant under history in architecture, that we felt it had potential for geography, but the application itself was not sufficient. The Landmark Preservation Commission felt through public comments as well as what was in the landmark designation application, that it was significant under history, architecture and geography. So they added to it. They added the significance of the geography piece. Well, it was in the designation application. They felt it was significant. They felt it was significant. Okay. All right. Thank you. And we have let me see, Councilwoman, take I saw you in there in the Q. I withdrew my name. Okay. Okay. Great. Looks like we have no other questions. The hearing for council bill 1021 is now closed. Comments from members of Council. Councilman Espinosa. And. So I apologize for some of my questioning, but and I apologize in advance for the length of my comments. But it's part because I've been I've been really quiet in order to respect the process this entire time and to not bias my colleagues. I am in a precarious position as the counsel person, and I honored and respected that throughout. That said, I want to thank members, I mean, people on both sides of the issue for coming out and staying with us well past what will be well past 11:00 to express your views. And I really want to thank those members of my community that supported me, which I'm happy to report. Could tally that the overwhelming number of people that were supporting this come from northwest Denver in my district. But I also want to acknowledge that there are individuals in this in this in this audience that spoke tonight that have done yeoman's work without direction from me and I purely on behalf of this House. And I really appreciate those efforts. So with that said. I just want to say that no one wants to be here in this situation, especially me, and hopefully you guys can get that. But our community deserves better than to have the destruction of a truly significant historic structure, be simply a checkbox on the path to create evermore overpriced townhomes that erode the character of the neighborhood and disregard the community's history. From the time this property was platted in the town of Highland and the home built by the Hoyt Hoyt family through the 12 decades of the Hoyt House's existence. This proud structure has prominently overlooked what is now known as Jefferson Park. Barring an act of God and with the protection provided by the Act of Council on behalf of this city and its future inhabitants, this one structure could remain to tell the story of this place, and the important individuals who lived here were raised here and educated in the same public schools where our children go and who went on to create great works of architecture that can still be found throughout the city because they too had been protected from the wrecking ball. Despite all the mediocre and disposable buildings that are the norm today in Jefferson Park, significant works of architecture that today have no equal originated here in Jefferson Park, in a household that fed the spark of creativity in the Hoyt children and provided an environment to dream, to draw, and to critically think in ways that were superior to their contemporaries. Given the alarmist statements that have been made, I would like to get on record a few facts. This application is, in fact, exceptional and rare. It does not represent some rash reaction that will result in some new norm. Since I have been in office, there have been 187 of these requests to the mall for the right to demolish a landmark structure of potentially landmark structure of the 180 786. Nearly half have been in my northwest Denver district, which means my district sees a lot more historic demolition than most, if not all, of my colleagues in the other ten districts. Of the 80 of the 86 that have come through my office, seven structures that had the potential to be significant points of contention among my constituents. Only one resulted in the landmarking application that only one resulted in a landmarking application that resulted in this sort of public hearing tonight. And that structure is now demolished. The other six potentially historic structures that generated community concern were avoided voluntarily. Three were withdrawn voluntarily, and the structures remain as is. Two were protected from demolition and destructive alteration via a covenant agreement with historic Denver. Who spoke really, really well? I forgot to mention that. And that was right on point. One was voluntarily withdrawn and a full restoration is almost complete. It's on the 3700 block of Navajo and it will be resold along with new developments on both sides of that of that new that existing home. It is safe to say there are a multitude of ways to meet the owners needs. And we heard another one. Thank you, Louis, for making that suggestion to address the community concerns. But in all cases, it requires an open, honest and sincere dialog. I am grateful to the owners that were and remain open to looking for Win-Win Solutions rather than shutting the door to the possibility of achieving an outcome that serves both them and the common good of the community. While difficult in every situation, achieving win win results have been one of the most rewarding aspects of my role in representing the community. However, there is no obligation that any owner engages in such dialog and they can choose to treat efforts and engage in dialog with hostility or be led to create barriers towards solutions that ultimately may even be in their own interests. The moment I saw this application, I was troubled. A concern rooted in my knowledge of the structure, the recognition of its potential for designation, and and the likely players and antics that would play out from development interests for the community if the community sought to protect this structure from demolition. Having experienced firsthand the distortions of truth and justice as an applicant of a community led landmark application. The personal toll and the personal toll that it had taken on my CO applicants. When I was contacted by the community about a desire to preserve the Hoyt House, I made a decision to act in my capacity on behalf of the community and put forth the application, thus allowing the structure to be considered on its merits with regard to the criteria and avoiding hostility being leveled on community members. As you are well aware, I have not lobbied you, my colleagues, on the merits of this home and hope that you have had the opportunity to review the wisdom of the city's architectural and historic experts, including general contractor, as I felt it inappropriate to ask for your support prior to this evening. Early on I reached out to the owner and while I was met with immediate hostility, she did eventually provide her terms that needed to be met to spare. That is what historic Denver and the Landmark Commission recognize as an important piece of Denver's history. The owner eventually made some unrealistic demands to spare the structure and publicly claim that she would consider offers from preservationist development developers, yet refused to allow potential bidders to enter the home they were. They would be preserving efforts to find a viable alternative, reliable time and access, bailing access in in light of the application deadline, there was simply not enough time to find a buyer that would purchase the home without having the opportunity to inspect it, which I think is understandable and the norm. I'm glad the owners supporters used the media to bring up my end tonight and spoke to bring up my aides needed corrections to the statement the owner was making at a neighborhood meeting last week. I say this because if the community fully understood the specifics of our ordinances, the laws that govern persons and property in Denver, and the multiple self-serve serving distortions of the law that made by the owner, they too would have spoken out. The application is for the applicant. The owner, sorry, has a full page letter in our neighborhood newsletter that has ten similar inaccuracies, which I have noted here in red. I don't expect you to be able to see it, but I'm happy to share. To use a volunteer newsletter that is delivered monthly by volunteer carriers to make dishonest claims to support destructive negative PR in the name of destroying a local landmark for personal gain is difficult for me to understand. My own household voluntarily delivered this newsletter. Not this one particularly, but the Japan newsletter. Four to the steps of the Hoyt House for eight of the last nine years. Doing so because community communication is a saint, was essential to creating the physical conditions that have resulted in the desirability of the Jefferson Park neighborhood that we experienced today . Which developers are understandably capitalizing on. Our route was 150 newsletters. After delivering nearly 15,000 newsletters, you learn a thing or two about Jefferson Park, the people new and old, and the physical environment, including the role of certain structures in the placemaking and history of Northwest Denver. I represent the constituents in Northwest Denver lawfully and to the best of my abilities on their matters, of their concern, of which this is one. I understand that the owner has left this home and it has become a rental property for her. It is my hope that the owner will understand that it is not my intent to steal the profits that she feels she deserves away from her, from away from her, because alternatives could very likely provide a similar monetary outcome while maintaining an important asset for the community in our city. Despite living in the neighborhood for almost nine years, the owner owner only attended two Jefferson Park United neighbor meetings this month and last month. Not everyone needs to be part of the R.A.. Still, I want those in the room to understand that I was there over 15 years ago when Jason held his very first public meeting. That day, we decided to work to improve the lives of those in our community, to take our neighborhood back from drug dealers, pimps, murderers, thieves and yes, poor development schemes that were designated that were designed to remove our history and make a developer quick buck schemes that left home homeowners with little and the community disrupted, stagnated and stripped of its character and its past. That community created the conditions that you will profit from, regardless of the outcome tonight. Like I said, no one wants to be here in this situation. Least of all me. Nonetheless, I am positive that if my colleagues agree with me that this home is in fact an important part of our Denver history that another developer with significant, significantly more foresight will make you whole. And we'll include the home in a development plan to create additional housing. Our city needs. I understand the owners desire to take the wealth she earned from her investment. They will help you in every way I can. But I cannot stand by idly and watch as those who have worked to better this neighborhood and keep its character lose one of the last significant connections to our past as it succumbs to a bulldozers bucket needlessly. The flip in attitude that some have about preservation is precisely why, as a society, we created tools to address these matters. When certain situations arise, meaningful parts of our past should remain to teach us, strengthen our communities, and inspire us and our children as we move forward. If the owner brought bought the home to demolish it, the owner should have researched the plausibility of that goal when it was purchased. Just as the developers in this instance have done, the owner could have made her purchase conditional on the seller providing a certificate of non historic status. While I believe that demolition requirements should be the responsibility of the party whose intention it is to demolish and stand to profit from it the most, the owner, if initially concerned about the potential for redevelopment, should have and could have taken this step at the time she acquired it. I, for one, believe it would be more fair to the owner, Judith, the community and council whom are tasked with these decisions. If the party desiring to tear this structure down took the risk, purchased it outright, and sought the demo permit themselves. It is cynical of the person who contracted the home for demo not bear this risk. And it is also absurd that council should be asked to support an individual who themselves has no intent of demolishing the home. The buyers, not the sellers, are expected to take the risk as they stand to earn the most profit. But since the narrative of deep pocket of a deep pocketed developer is less compelling than that of a single woman with one asset, we find ourselves here. Due diligence reveals that the structure has merit on all three criteria of our preservation ordinance, which can hinder legal demolition of the structure. Of the structure. Its location at the time it was built was significant to both the town of Highlands and Denver history. The architecture was undeniably of the period in which it was built, and it has maintained those details through time. Admittedly, the association to significant figures in Denver history would be less overt to the lay investigator. But simple investigation makes an instantly compelling case that famed Denver architects Burnham and Merrill Hoyt resided at the home through their formative years, and Burnham resided in the home at the time that he and his brother started their practice in Denver and while producing lasting works to our city's legacy. The Hoyt House has value as an important historic landmark and reference point to our city's formation and designation allows it to be a physical reminder that North Denver youth have and will continue to go on to achieve great things in our city and around the world. Significant works by the Hoyt. By the Hoyt are the fourth Church of Christ Scientists, which is in District one. The Denver Public Library, Park Hill Branch and Central Branch. Surry Hills Country Club. The Denver Press Club. Lake Junior High School, which also in District one might be Boulevard Presbyterian Church Education, Main St Martin's Chapel, Steele Elementary School Addition and most notably, the Red Rocks Ampitheater. I read the owner's statement of Desire, and I want my colleagues to know that the home is serviceable despite deferred maintenance and both the home and land as is, have appreciated considerably. Designation only affects the portion of land or assemblage that occupies the home's footprint, meaning the develop ability of the remainder of the parcel with new construction remains, which adds additional value beyond that of the home alone. Regarding the impact of landmark designation, it should be noted that these designations apply to hundreds of structures in the city. And you saw us do it to a whole bunch more tonight. Overwhelmingly, they're sought voluntarily. In other words, the sky doesn't fall with designation of the structure and even non owner designation in even when this the designation is non owner. You need look no further than the success of the Beth Eden Church, a non owner designation approved in 2014. Successful component of redevelopment in District one. Buyers do exist for this home. However, it has been the decision of the applicant not to allow those buyers to enter the home. That has likely brought us to this point where we are today. I urge my colleagues to honor the fact that the criteria of the governing ordinance are met and consideration of the owners desires has been given and approved the structure for designation. I recognize to a person, including me, this is not the most desirable way to achieve protection of a historic structure. However, the laws in place to protect structures and even less than and even in less than amicable circumstances, we cannot assume to know that there is any potential loss in value because the owner denied any attempt by preservationists to assess the property to develop an offer. Unlike the Anderson House, we do not know what the value of the current offer. The value of the current offer. Sorry. So no one can declaratively state that the offer is or is not fair market value regardless. None of that is for our consideration, except as far as it was mentioned in the owner's statement. What we do know is that architecturally significant and an architecturally significant home, historic home across the street from a beautifully maintained, activated city park near great local retailers. And with quick access to downtown and transit options, historically designated or not, is a very desirable property both before and after this hearing. As stated tonight, there is a market for this home. The last Queen Inn along adjacent to the park. With Designation Council will provide a unique opportunity to bring the new bringing together the new with the old in a highly visible setting that tells our story, the story of the past, but also the story of what is achievable. Growing up in northwest Denver, I urge my colleagues to support the residents throughout northwest Denver that I am representing by approving this application. Thank you. All right, Councilman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. Well, there's such a contrast between the difference between our first hearing tonight for Kassala Park and the one afterwards, and shows the difference when you have owners who do want to who are who are engaged and who do want to have some historical designation versus requiring a homeowner to make their home a landmark . I do believe the designation process that we're working with tonight, with that without the willingness of the owner. Needs some further scrutiny. It does need a higher bar. I appreciate the questions my colleague, Councilwoman Gilmore mentioned, and I hope I'm not stealing your thunder. But the resources that the city has compared to what the resources of the homeowner has are perhaps insurmountable for most homeowners, single homeowners. These have come before us before, and I always kind of think of it in a personal way. What if it were my home? I have a 1938 home, and I don't know whether it has historical significance or not, but of three different, if three strangers could come and say to me, You must designate your home and I'm going to use the resources of the city to make you designate your home. I think I would I would be. I don't know. I don't know how I could react. I mean, it also is my life savings as well. When you're told that it requires to to maintain the house or to make it historic, would require more repairs than it's worth. In car language that's called totaled. But it made me very uncomfortable that we were asking the owner, Well, why didn't you take this offer? Why didn't you take this offer? And I got it offer for you. It seems like an invasion of privacy. I well, the other thought I thought I had is. If preservation always increased a home's value, wouldn't we have many more people applying for historic preservation? If it really was so valuable? And I, I didn't know there was only one gentleman that said that he was considering getting his home designated. I don't know how many others from Northwest Denver have designated their own home. And I would imagine from the discussions that I've heard and knowing Northwest ever as I do, there would be many of them that would be perhaps eligible for designation. I also got was distressed sometimes to hear this is what people will say, that people will seek designation of somebody else's home to stop development. And I certainly heard that tonight, too. And that's not the purpose of historic designation. Not at all. So. I'm the chair of the Land Use Committee that we have, and I'm going to maybe take a look at this particular ordinance to see if it still works today from when it was I know it was worked on very, very assiduously by the previous councilman, J.D. Robb, and by historic Denver and by landmark preservation. And I, I think I'd like to work on that again and and see if it does it needs some tweaking and maybe a higher bar for hostile designation. And by this little speech, you probably realize that I won't be voting for the historic designation tonight. Thank you, gentlemen. Sussman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. Last week, I guess about ten days ago, I went up and met with one of our arts and venues, folks up at Red Rocks, to review the some of the changes that are being planned for the planter boxes there because of some issues that have come up with the vegetation. And so that's such a magnificent place that the architect Hoyt gave to us. And then on Tuesday last week, I had a reception for a woman who sang soprano in my church choir for many years, who's moving to California. And she held it at the Cherokee Castle down in Sedalia because she and her family knew Tweed Kimball. And I frequently use the central library down here in Denver. Another one of Burnham Hoyt's creations. And also, God forbid, I was president of the Denver Press Club and a member for many, many years, another one of his more pedestrian products for the Fourth Estate. And all that is to say that it is through his works that we remember Burnham, Hoyt and what he means to this community. Up until this application, the Landmark Commission staff wasn't even aware that he had lived in this house. We remember Burnham when we value him because of the things that he left us. And. I think that's the most appropriate way to to honor him. I don't believe that the fact that he grew up in that house, he and his brother is enough to say that the house itself is a Denver landmark. And so for that reason, I won't support that criteria. And I also don't support the the geography finding that it's a beautiful queen. And it really is. It's right up the street from a st river drive, which has a number of beautiful queen hands on it, that maybe that hope, that river drive ought to be a landmark district in order to preserve the Queen Anne's. But because I don't believe that it meets those two criteria, I won't support it tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Flynn, Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. In listening to everyone's comments tonight, I've narrowed it down to sort of four issues that we're talking about. And the first one is about a community that's very frustrated about new development and ugly development and high density. And I totally get it. I. Councilman Espinosa took us on a great tour of his district this summer. And it's sad. A lot of beautiful homes have been lost and there are a lot of ugly new buildings. There's got to be a better way to preserve neighborhoods and ensure better developments. A lot of the problems are because of our zoning code and blueprint. Denver, which happened before most of us were on this council. But taking away her property rights is not the right way to fix that problem. But I get I get the frustration. And I think it's I think it's a tragedy. The second issue is it's about historic preservation. Does this House have historical value? Yes, it does have historical value. I think if we're doing a hostile landmarking, it has to have a much higher bar. This is definitely a higher bar than the Anderson house. But, you know, is it up there with the Molly Brown house? You know, I agree with Councilman Flynn on that. And I thought that was very well said. Councilman Flynn, I would love to see it preserved. Mr. Bucy, if you're still here, you're the hero of the evening. Let's make that work. That would be really. A great. Compromise. So I would love to see it preserved. I don't think it means that high. Bar that. I think needs to happen for this hostel. Landmarking. The other issue I think, is about private property rights. And as as council people, we have to find the balance. And to designate a structure without the owner's permission, as I've already said three times, requires a very high hurdle. And I think the historic significance needs to be extraordinary. And as I've said before, if someone wanted to tear down the Brown Palace, I would be first in line to stop them. But doing this does take away her rights as a property owner, and it does negatively impact the value of the property. And I, I love the the tax credits offered at the state, but that's you're not making money off of those. It helps offset some of your costs. And. The Fifth Amendment requires the government to provide just compensation when taking property. Now, this isn't exactly taking someone's property, but it is taking someone's property rights. And if we're going to do that. We need to give them fair market value for their property. And the last point I have is that our our process is broken. And thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, for saying we are going to talk about it at the Land Use Committee. Last year after we had two of these. Councilman Cashman and Councilwoman Sussman, I had a conversation with Brad. If you can grab, you can. And our director of community planning and development about this, telling him that we thought this was broken and he said, oh, we've never had these before and we're not going to have anymore. So it is broken. It's it pits neighbors against neighbors. It's being used to solve a problem that it wasn't meant to solve. And it actually doesn't solve it, which is overdevelopment and ugly architecture. I also feel like poor Ms.. Batiste has been on trial tonight, and I think that's a horrible thing that we did to her. She owns that house and she should not be put on trial. It's completely unfair and it's biased against the property owner. And there's also no way to pause the process. So the hero, Mr. Beauty, has a great idea, but we can't pause the process. And so there's. Those are the things I've identified that I think that we as a council need to look at and fix. Obviously, I will not be supporting this tonight. I am a historian and I support historic preservation, but this is not the way to do it. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. And I think what Councilwoman Black meant to say is you are all heroes for staying this late. Okay. That's true. Yes. Thank you all for being here. Councilman? Yes? I have some of the same concerns that Councilwoman Sussman and everyone else has said, but also definitely respect the professionalism and and the criteria that we use for historic preservation. I'm just not sure that we can just say, well, this does. This is a property that didn't meet all the work that was done by historic Denver and and and the landmark preservation. So I can't believe that we wouldn't just we'll just ignore all the criteria for historic designation. I have my district has the largest number of historic district and historic homes. And they recognize and appreciate historic designation. And they're all of those values. And those homes have increased over the years dramatically so. So I'm not sure that's an economic issue. But but there's no question, Roma, the process is broken. There's what everyone has said is true. There's something wrong with this this kind of way we manage this hostile designation process that troubles me a great deal about what has happened. And what I've heard tonight. But I also think that I have to respect the criteria that we go by and the work that our staff does. So I will be supporting this designation tonight and, you know, definitely support. Councilwoman Sussman has worked to relook at this entire process. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. New Councilwoman Gilmore. Thank you, President Brooks. I appreciate, you know, Councilwoman Sussman and others bringing up that the the process needs to be relooked at and that it is broken and under historical significance. You know, the the Hoyt brothers lived in their mother's home and that the sheet that was left on my desk has 15 buildings that the Hoyts designed . When you break it down, 13 out of the 15 on this list are either under the Colorado State Register of Historic Places are designated a Denver landmark or are under the National Register of Historic Places. So the history of the Foyt brothers and their, you know, designing will not be lost. There are 13 projects that are already recognized. The home that their mother, the home that their mother owned and that they lived in. I don't see that as historical significance. And then the the third one under geographic significance, I it's next to a park. There are lots of structures next to a park. And so I don't think that it for for this application reaches a higher level, which I think should be the bar, especially when it's an owner opposed designation. And frankly, it's really troublesome that between the three entities that I asked to come up and thank you for your your honesty and your candor that there are at least 21 folks from nonprofit city entities that. Are professionals that are attorneys that have a high, I'm sure, beyond a bachelor's degree. And how with 21 folks, we were not able to open the doors of communication and not have. Miss Batiste feel like she was being attacked or that she didn't want to talk to anyone. We as the government cannot force a private citizen to work with us. That's not the sort of government we live in. And so it is totally her right to say, no, I don't want to. And then that means that those 21 folks, they need to reach a higher threshold. To come up with some sort of solution. I did not see that tonight. I didn't hear that tonight. And so based on me not feeling like it reached that it met. Historical significance or geographic significance? I will not be supporting this tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I hate this. And I will own. I was wondering if Councilwoman Black would remember when we went through the Anderson House and the other property known as The View House. We met and said this. This ordinance is a mess. And we we met and I would have told you we spoke, Mr. Broad. Well, maybe my memory slipped. But in any event, I didn't take action. On that. And I feel very sorry for Miss Battista, but I don't feel any more sorry for you than I do for the community, because that community has taken some big time hits, and I did not do my part to craft an ordinance that might have lent itself to to to helping in a situation like this. I have a hard time seeing how to do this on the back of an individual. I just do. We need to fix that. We set aside I don't know how much money. I think it's couple $3 million every year in a fund in case. City employees get themselves into legal troubles that we need to settle on. With the with the importance of historic preservation. I would think it would make at least as much sense to set a few bucks away, especially with the wonderful discovered Denver Project. That's coming up where we're going to come up with an inventory of what really matters, and we can begin addressing that in a coherent way. So I am not going to be able to. And I'm not going to be able to. My guess is. Support hostile designations until we correct this ordinance so that it's a more fair playing field. I'm also of the. Feeling that it does need to be a higher bar and a hostile situation. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. I. I appreciate everybody's taking in and I appreciate a lot of the testimony. You know, I. I get that. It's a very difficult process. I absolutely do. However, there are criteria that need to be met. Does that. You know, I trust our staff and trust the professionals that are out there that if they see some designated historic, they'll take the appropriate action. I rarely see things that don't that the CPD or staff don't support come to us and say, Oh, well, staff doesn't support this, by the way. It's fully vetted by them when it comes to us. And it ultimately is our decision. You know, as Batiste, I totally get it. I absolutely get it. And I respect your I respect you and I respect your property rights. I absolutely understand the financial part. Right. And that's why I think, you know, it gets to be very uncomfortable. And, you know, you feel like you're being put on the stand. And and I apologize if that's the feeling you get, because that's not the intent of that podium. That's not the intent of the diocese. It's not a courtroom. We are not judges. There is nobody that that's supposed to you know, we ask questions, you know, should be just to answer information. And I know that it gets to a point where or, you know, a person needs to be gaveled down. I absolutely get that. I understand the economic impact. I didn't get to see this, but I was wondering if folks folks that live in the immediate neighborhood. Stand up, please. Just so I can see her. Put your hands up. The folks that live in the immediate neighborhood around this and Jefferson Park know in this area, district one is huge in this immediate neighborhood of Jefferson Park. Okay. That's. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. You can sit down. I'm sorry. I wanted to get that. Just that visual, just to understand, because up here, as we're telling. It's hard to tell. Here's where we have conflict. History does not just happen in historic designations aren't just okay when they're the east side of the river. For the most part, there's a lot of neighborhoods that have historic homes that have been designated already. This process has happened over and over in the decades without them being declared hostile, even though there's probably opposition to them. In this particular neighborhood, what concerns me is the level of overdevelopment and the the lack of respect for some of those structures. The applications that have came through and came past our days. I think, you know, some of them are right. Some of them had issues. However, you know, I absolutely think that there is a problem. With with our process. But also, there's a problem with the lack of respect for community rights as well to. There's a lack of respect for the community's integrity. It becomes high a high dollar business. It upsets me to see millionaires intermingling with everybody else pretending not to be. If you really want to fix this system, absolutely have at it. Let's do it. But I want to see us ban the corporate giving as well, too, in political contributions. I think that has an influence as well, too, and in a convoluted process. You know, I absolutely respect Councilman Espinosa's. Work. I think there is an issue that needs to be addressed. I think we need to keep a lot of those structures there, a lot of integrity there. I know this thing isn't going to pass. It's not going to pass muster. I can. I can count. However, I do think that we need to absolutely respect the integrity of a community. And I have to address something that the difference between. You know, when you look at a place like Christina Park and you look at Northwest Denver, there's no comparison in terms of it's the developers that are just scrambling over each other, trying to develop every piece of land, every parcel they got out there. It's a little different. I'm going to vote to support the application because in North Denver there is a big crisis. There's a lack of respect for the integrity of the structures in that neighborhood and the history of that neighborhood. Right. And so I'm and I'm going to I'm going to vote to support it. I think that's it's important enough to go on the record and say that, especially when I don't see a huge number of people from the neighborhood here tonight who can't be here tonight. When you see them on Facebook, when you see them and when they're contacting our offices, we all know that Northwest Denver is in trouble and we need to do something about that. And at the same time, to my colleagues who are calling for a reform of this process, I absolutely look forward to it. But we also need a tool to actually keep the neighborhoods integrity together. And that does include customized zoning. That does include areas where you need those overlays in northwest Denver. So thank you, everybody, for coming out tonight. I really appreciate it. And Mr. Batiste. I have a good number for that whole sewage pipe thing. I had the same problem. Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to say thank you to everybody for sticking it out, for coming here, for being passionate about our communities. And I don't want to write about it. A lot of stuff on saying I don't want to repeat. So the Cliff Notes version of what has already been said that really I was underlining and highlighting was Councilman Cashman saying that he hates this, I hate this neighbor turned against neighbor kind of process and we have to find a way to get better. Which leads me to Councilwoman Sussman talking about the system being broken and needing change. Councilwoman Black talking about the tour that we did of Council District one. And my heart also goes out to this community. And it's also a reminder that it's not just about what's going on in this community, but this kind of pressure is coming to a neighborhood near all of us with the kind of growth that Denver is experiencing and facing. And then it really struck me when Councilman Flynn talked about we don't remember architects necessarily by where they grew up, but by the buildings that they left behind that are protected. This is a really hard process. And I don't know that there is a there is an immediate answer. I'm glad that we're going to jump into it. But I struggle with this every time that we face it and we can see the struggle and the tension in this room. So, you know, I think that, you know, where this is headed and everything that's been said, we talked a little bit about the hero of the night in moving the house. And I think there's another potential hero in this room and a different way of us looking at protecting what we all love in our city. And that is Mr. Weekley over there, because I think that what gets overlooked in what's broken about our landmark ordinance, which is nights like tonight, is the fact that or the landmark designations that come through that are owner initiated are. Hugely successful. And the success rate of those is through the roof. And I think that we have a house on Jefferson Park in northwest Denver with an owner who's willing to consider designating it. That's a huge. Win, especially considering how divisive these things have been as we've looked at preserving homes in northwest Denver. I don't want that to get lost. I think that that that I was in a neighborhood meeting in my community where we were talking about landmark designation and about the pressure that is coming from development. And we were talking about one structure that is in imminent threat of being torn down like this one. And I looked at everybody, I said, there are 50 people in this room. If every single one of us looked at our structure that we're living in, that we own, and said, Hey, let's preserve as many of those as we had. We'd have one of the biggest historic districts in the city from that effort. And so I would say we need to take this look that we we deal with these as their threat. And we have to look and say, if these communities are worth preserving, if the character of these communities are worth preserving, then we need to start on our own doorstep, because I think we can set a lot of fear at ease to show that, hey, I have lived here and I've done this and I've gone through the window thing and I'm your neighbor and I can talk you through it and I can tell you what that's all about. And I can show you how my house is appreciating faster than the other ones and not some study that somebody put out who is pro or con, but somebody who is your neighbor saying, I did this and this is how it works. I think that that that everything that's broken up here we've seen and everyone that has come through so far on this council has failed. And, you know, again, I can count as well. And this one's going to fail. This isn't we're not going to get there this way. We're going to have a lot of nights like this that go deep into the night where everybody's upset. But there's another way. And I think that that starts with people like Mr. Weekley over here and saying, hey, how do we set an example? How do we lead by that example? How do we show what we value by the actions that we take with the property that we own? Because I think that that can change the paradigm, too. So I hope that will continue that conversation in northwest Denver, regardless of the outcome tonight. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Clark. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to try to not be redundant in covering comments that have already been made. So I'm the only one on this case who was here when Blueprint Denver was adopted, and I represented Jefferson Park in Northwest Denver. And Mr. Bucy and Mr. Olson, I think you both remember lesson Lucille Bloom and how. If they were in trying to protect their neighborhood, just like neighborhoods all across this city work to protect their neighborhoods. We've seen drastic changes in Jefferson Park and some of those the neighborhood. Work towards bringing to the community. They wanted to see some change along Speer Boulevard. They wanted to see some change along the the I-25 edge of the community. And when Blueprint Denver was created. The look was to address the edges of our neighborhoods and to try to protect the core and the residential character of our neighborhoods. And we've seen some change, too. You know, it started in Cherry Creek where we started seeing scrape offs. And then we've seen that happen all across the city. You know, Northwest Denver is not isolated. I think you're seeing large numbers of of development activity that's happening. I live in one of those neighborhoods. I mean, in lower highlands, where we've seen pretty drastic change in in my area as well. And I think when you have people coming out wanting to protect part of the the history of their neighborhood, you know, if if we don't and if we didn't do that with lower downtown. What would we have in our city? I mean, we'd have a bunch of new buildings. There were concerted efforts made when Skyline Urban Renewal was happening and buildings downtown were being torn down left and right, beautiful historic buildings. And it took some concerted effort to ensure that we were working to protect some of that history of this city. I was very involved in the lower downtown historic district. And you think this was a fight? We had preservation community. On one end, we had property owners over here and and we were able to find some middle ground so that it wasn't just a big fight, but. We now have that part of our history that we can continue to enjoy and and that we've protected for not just people who grew up here, but for anybody who comes here to know that that's part of the history of our city. And, you know, I appreciate what you've been through, Mr. Batiste. Just knowing the the uncertainty of, you know, what's going to happen with your property, with your investment, I think, you know, this this whole conversation came up when we were doing lower downtown for people who wanted to do improvements to their property they didn't want. And I think this gets to the point that was being asked of of Mr. Weekley earlier. You want to have some some assurances that everything around you isn't just going to disappear. And that was what some of the property owners in lower downtown were very concerned about, knowing that there was going to be some predictability, some assurances that, you know, the investment they were making, that other property owners would be doing the same thing. I. I don't like it when neighborhoods are fighting against one another either. When we have people on opposing sides, but we have tools in our toolbox for a reason to try to look at how we as a city try to preserve some of these assets. I mean, Jefferson Park is is a whole different neighborhood now. And I think the ability to look at just saving one historic property, that that people can come to our neighborhood and say, wow, you know, that's part of the history of this neighborhood. I would love to see, you know, River River Drive protected, very similar to what was done with Stoneman Zero in the Highlands neighborhood. You know, those those historic homes are protected. I don't believe River River Drive is. I would love to see that done because there are some beautiful homes. You know, the blooms lived in in one of those houses. And I think it's the passion and the advocacy of of people wanting to just protect the the little bit of of of history and culture that we have in in our city and our neighborhoods that are that are changing. I mean, the demographics and the price of housing in the city has changed so drastically. We all know that, you know, unless you are a property owner, you can't even afford to live in this city because everything is so expensive. And, you know, I did want to speak to just the quality of some of the housing stock that we're seeing, not just in northwest Denver, but in some of our neighborhoods. Some of this stuff isn't being built to where it's going to last, the same way some of these older structures are. And when and where we can protect them, I think that it's it's important for us to look at doing that as much as possible. I am going to support this tonight. I know the votes are not here for protecting this property. You know, I'm doing a count, as we've heard people talk up and down the dais. But I think having these tools and looking at what kind of tweaks need to be make to be made to the ordinance, I want to be part of that conversation because I think without the historic designation tool, the city would be a drastically different city than what it is in terms of, you know, some of the neighborhoods that we have, like the Baker neighborhood, where we have the historic district that has enjoyed an increase in property values long before we saw the the incline in our economy and the investment in in properties. The Potter Highlands historic district has enjoyed some very. You know, high priced housing that was in place before we started seeing, you know, a change in the Highland neighborhood. So I'm going to support this tonight. I appreciate the communication that my office has received from everybody on all sides. I know this has not been an easy feat for Councilman Espinosa in in going through this. I know he's been under a lot of scrutiny by people who are on the opposing side of this issue. But this is part of our political process and part of the the, you know, just the the the the way of doing business here in terms of the tools that we do have to work with. And so, as I said earlier, I'll be supporting this tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa. I saw you, Pop. Yeah. I just want to dovetail on Councilman Ortega's comments because it spurred a couple of thoughts. The reality of the votes, and I shouldn't be able to count these votes before we have this hearing. But I did. I mean, people who were at the Jefferson Park, the last Jefferson Park meeting, you know, that I stood up there and I said, look, I fully expect this to not go through. I know where my colleagues sit on these sort of their statements about non owner designated. Designations. And so I'm not at all surprised and I don't think you guys are should be surprised that I'm not surprised because I stated it so clearly. But the notion that Jefferson Park. You know, should have just been one of those areas where, you know, it got designated with a district like Curtis Park and whatnot. You know, it it overlooks the history. And that's why I brought up the fact that I was there 15 years ago. Jefferson Park wasn't ever contiguous, even though the houses in the form and the character of those blocks looked like a neighborhood. It was never the right conditions to be a neighborhood. And what I mean by that is somewhere along the line in the 1950s, well, after all these houses were built, the city saw fit to reason that areas are three, which was unlimited height. And so there were people that went in there and purchased property and assembled property on this notion that they could build skyscrapers and jets and arrow towers. And even though in the in the 2000s after the Jefferson Park neighborhood had gotten together and cleaned that area up and worked hard to rid crime and laid down their vision that Councilwoman Ortega spoke to about this sort of core residential neighborhood, a single family and two unit, single unit and two unit homes ringed by incredible development. I mean, there's support, plan, support for 14 and 20 storey structures on the periphery of Jefferson Park, which I would love to encourage development and those densities in those areas. The city chose in 2010 to not zone not recognize that plan. And so codifying the gma3, which is a really, really nasty zone district, I mean, the six buildings that we're spoken to that have townhomes in our townhomes for all intents and purposes, in the GMU three zone district, which does not permit the townhome form. What those are six apartment forms. And and so the notion that Jefferson Park ever could have been spared through a landmark designation of a district was just never there because it was tried and attempted previously. And so that community always looked to this city to help it, to bolster it back when it was a primarily minority community with low, low incomes. Now it's now it's more affluent and the demographics have shifted. And I recognize that. So the reason why I'm saying that is that last week on a rezoning, I had mentioned to the village park community that the city had failed them. They failed them by not doing a station area plan and getting in front of the new development pressures into Jefferson Park. This this vote tonight and the actions that council made in 2010 have failed you. You had set down a vision for a walkable neighborhood with with tree lined streets and buildings that orient themselves to the to the streets. And you didn't get that. And there's nothing nothing that we can do at this point to change, to reverse that tide. I mean, we still we've recognize that that River Drive has intrinsic character, but one of the main property owners tonight spoke against this rezoning. I don't know how Mr. Chandler would feel about designation of his area. I hope that he would support it. But, you know, that is the last little vestige. River Drive in Clay Street, my half of the block that have sort of the historic integrity that Jefferson Park once flooded Jefferson Park. And so I just wanted to reiterate what Councilwoman Ortega was saying, that this was one little fragment that could have remained. And I'm sorry to have let my community down. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, in other comments. I'll make a few comments and then I'm going to turn it over to David Braswell, who I neglected to mention during the question portion. But. Quickly because you guys have been gracious folks on all ends. Thank you for being here. Thank you for parking, going through security, sitting in these heart seats. And I just really appreciate you all showing up and community. This is how we build community. I know it doesn't feel like this now because everybody is on each other's, you know, on another team and another side. But let me just say, Rafael Espinosa and I took 2 hours together to. To go through Jefferson Park and and all of District one. And and I mostly listened and and listened to what had happened and what is happening in the neighborhood. And it is a definite transformation of the historical context of the neighborhood. And and it was it was unbelievable that we began to talk about what is the solution to this issue that's going on. And as I'm listening tonight, as I'm listening, as we had the conversation, I started thinking of people like Bill West, Dana Crawford, Justin Croft. That's in the midst of it right now, John Noble, individuals who in this city in my district, I've I've seen do and some I've heard about because I'm not that old. But take their context and look at any solution possible around preservation and the solution Dana Crawford had and LoDo was how do we how do we secure these building, not this building, these buildings. And Curtis Park. Devastation was happening all over Curtis Park. And Bill West led a charge of community members and said, how do we begin looking at overlay districts and landmark districts just right now and 30th and Blake in Reno which definitely is not contiguous and has a lot of different issues, property owners, folks came together on an eight month conversation on an overlay district. And so this is not a one size fits all, fits all. But if we want to get at preservation one structure at a time, I think we're in trouble. I think we need to start thinking on a larger scale and how to accomplish this. We just passed an overlay district, totally different context, but I believe there is a solution for Jefferson Park. I believe there is a solution for District one. I believe there is a solution for San Rafael who struggling with this question. I believe there's a solution for Park Hill who is struggling with this question of 300, 300 homes in a landmark district. And now 700 homes. But but but here's what's great about it. Here's what's great about it. There's not a shot clock. Right? It's not 90 days. They're having a conversation about it. And that is what's missing here is we are missing a conversation about it. And you've heard we don't know the answer. So I believe that landmark districts, overlay districts are more my preferred type of route one. And number two, we need a fund. We have funds all over the city to do special projects. But we don't have a fund for preservation. We need a fund and we need to talk about it. I will not. I cannot support this. And it it it you know, Councilwoman, I know you are the chair of Luti, and I am going to be working with you because we do need to do better as a community. As a community on both sides, we do need to do better. So, David. You have the floor. Thank you, Mr. President. Given the lateness of the hour, I just recommend council proceed directly to a vote. We look forward to working with you on any conversations about future changes to the ordinance at a later date. Thank you. Madam Secretary, roll call. Espinosa. No. Flynn. No. Gilmore. I. Cashman.

My apologies. Councilmember Johnson. Thank you. Council President Harrell As you are aware, this piece of legislation will require all residential development in the city to either pay a fee to build more affordable housing or to build affordable housing on site. I'm very excited to bring this piece of legislation forward today, but before I speak to the bill, we have two small amendments. And may I suggest that now that Councilmember Bryan is back, we start with his amendment. Senator, in your timing, you have an amendment, I believe, to the section one one. Great. Thank you, Councilmember Johnson. I'll go ahead and move amendment number 1/2. But amendment number one does it corrects a typo that we caught in the process. If you look at the amendment, you can see where they changed the language specifically. We had always intended to refer to looking at the pin payment in lieu fees and how they affected projects inside of the downtown South Lake Union area. We actually had put outside in there and so this would correct that. So the bill has been moved. The amendment has been moved in second. And all those in favor of the amendment bill I, I opposed. The ayes have it. So it is a minute in that sense. So Council President Harrell I've got a Second Amendment that as you know, the establishment of the framework legislation is subject to our 36.7 a .50. Our legal team has requested that we amend the ordinance to include a findings of fact which demonstrates how our program meets the requirements of the our CW, including facts related to our affordable housing need, and outlining how the proposed program will operate in accordance with state code. The amendment is proposed to insert a new section into the ordinance to attach the findings of fact. And I'd like to move Amendment two to amend Council Bill 118736 by adding new Section one and titled The City Council hereby makes the findings of fact an attachment add to this ordinance. Second. Second. So a Second Amendment has been proposed by Councilman Johnson in the other questions on the amendment. All those in favor of the amendment vote i. I opposed. The ayes have it. So we have an amendment piece of legislation with two amendments. Councilmember Johnson, you. Wouldn't mind allowing me to speak just for a few minutes on the underlying bill? Council President Harrell I want to first start by saying thank you to the members of Washington. Can LGBT, LGBTQ allies ship as well as Puget Sound Stage for showing up today to testify in support of this program? This program is critical for the success of our city. As you're aware, rising housing costs in the city are having a real impact on our residents. Over 40,000 of our households are paying more than 50% of their income in rent. We know this burden is experienced even more acutely by communities of color. We hear from residents every day who are struggling to afford to stay in the city of Seattle, where they move away from their families, from their places of worship, from their schools, to get the services that they need, they need to be able to afford to live in the city. We must address the tools with all the available tools in front of us. And I think this is a critically important tool in order to build out 6000 affordable units towards our goal of 20,000 new units over the next ten years. We had a great discussion over several months around this legislation. We heard from many folks who in the community emailed, called or stopped by our hearings or our public meetings, and we made some significant changes to the legislation. And I want to thank in particular Councilmember Herbold and O'Brien, who spent a lot of time working with me on this legislation. One of the elements that we heard is that the community was interested in seeing a greater percentage of the units that will result from this program being built in the neighborhood. So we amended the legislation to include that. We heard that the community would like the term of affordability to last longer. So we amended the term from 50 years to 75 years. We heard from the community that they wanted us to do a better job of allowing folks who are renting in that building when it gets converted into homeownership, be offered the opportunity for first rate refusal to stay in their building and purchase those units. We, I think, really heard from the community about how they want more accountability and reporting. So we changed the timeline to advance how early reporting, to understand how the program is really working as it's intended to. This bill is a culmination of years of dedication from advocates in the community who have been fighting for more affordable housing in the city. I was proud to shepherd this through the city council. We've still got a lot of work in front of us. This bill doesn't actually change any zoning codes today, but what it does do is it provides an important framework to ensure that every new residential development the city will either pay a fee into the Office of Housing to build more affordable housing or build more affordable housing on site. I'm proud of this piece of legislation and encourage my colleagues to vote yes. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. Any further comments on Council Bill 118736? Councilmember Herbold. Thank you. So this legislation is definitely historic in that we will, for the first time require developers to contribute to affordable housing whenever they build. That's that's a really big deal. I want to highlight the other sort of historic nature of this bill. For the past 30 years, housing advocates have been trying to get displacement mitigation recognized. The amendments that we worked on to this bill, I think, takes a really important step towards towards that effort. Councilmembers O'Brian and Laquita were the first to encourage the city in 2014 to discuss and study how development left unregulated, regulated without some level of mitigation can impact vulnerable communities. Before that, displacement was largely unrecognized as a result of development. We know that between 25 and 2015, the city permitted the demolition of almost 6000 units of housing. We don't know how many of them were affordable and we don't know how many of them were rental. But we do know that those were units that were contributing to our our housing. Dock. Since older buildings are more likely to be affordable than new construction, this inevitably has been an impact on our our affordable housing stock. The. The efforts of this amendment, I think, are small and incremental. They will not stop housing demolition in the city, but it is an important recognition that a racially inclusive and affordable city will mean taking steps to not lose what affordable housing that we already have. Thank you. Thank you. Katherine Herbert. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? Council Member O'Brien. Now, I'll just briefly want to also thank council members Johnson and Herbold for your great work on this. This is an outstanding piece of legislation that I'm very excited to support today. For the reasons you've heard before, requiring that all development contributes to affordable housing in the city is a great step forward. Also, the work around addressing displacement. The language in this bill, I think is a great step forward. There's a lot of good language in this bill, but until we do further actions both around how we address displacement and the zoning changes needed to necessary to make this implemented, it'll just be language. And so I'm proud and excited to stand with my colleagues today and support this, recognizing that we have some ongoing work to do so we can actually get more affordable housing in our community. All right. Take her home. All those a call. Let me have a call. A roll call on the passage of the amended council. Bill 118736. BURGESS All right. Gonzalez I. Herbold. Johnson. Suarez. O'Brien.

But just as a reminder, this bill was held over last Monday because the county was reassessing the tax levy rate in light of changes to their financial forecasting. However, the decision was made not to adjust the rate currently in the legislation, which is 26.5 cents per $1,000 of assessed value. So there is no a mandatory works to this legislation that's in front of us and it is now ready to proceed to a vote by the full Seattle City Council so that the levy proposal can be placed on the ballot for the November 5th general election.

We will expedite it. So it would appear on next Tuesday's council agenda. That takes us to the next to them on our agenda. Proposed Motion 2020 208 calling for the executive to allow restaurants and retail businesses in unincorporated King County to have flexibility to provide more outdoor service. Mary Annan will give the Senate report has begun. The line is yours. Thank you, Mr. Chair. For the record, Mary Bergeron from the council staff and the materials for this item began on page 433 of your packet. As you noted, proposed motion 2020 0208 would ask the executive to allow restaurants and retail services in unincorporated King County flexibility to provide outdoor dining or retail services in addition to what is allowed indoors during the phased reopening plan. As you all know, King County is right now in modified phase one of the Safe Start reopening plan and has applied to move into phase two, which could be permitted as early as the end of this week. Both of those phases impose fairly significant limitations on the kinds of activities that can happen indoors. And you'll see on page 435 of the packet, there is a chart that lists the types of activities that are allowed in modified phase one. And I'll call out in particular that for restaurants. Indoor seating is allowed at 25% capacity in modified phase one, 50% in phase two for retail operations, 15% indoor capacity in modified phase one, 30% in phase two for both of those types of services. Outdoor activities are more expansive, basically because the risk of transmission is lower outdoors. And so for restaurants in both phases, outdoor seating is allowed at 50% of existing capacity, with new or additional seating allowed if it can be spaced so that there's six feet of distance between tables. And then for retail activities again, there would be additional activities allowed outdoors as long as there is appropriate distancing. So what this motion would do is ask the executive that for restaurants and retail services in unincorporated King County, that they be given flexibility to expand outdoor activities in privately owned areas such as parking areas or other private property, as well as adjacent sidewalks, alleys or other right of way ensuring that steps are taken to ensure adequate pedestrian pathways and that there be no additional permits or fees required. So the proposed motion would ask the executive to look into this to prepare any legislation needed and to implement this request with the provision that at the time that the county enters phase four of the Safe Start plan, which would essentially be the back to normal activity that these provisions would sunset. That concludes my report. At this point, I know that we've got executive staff here, if there are any questions, and I'm happy to answer any questions as well. Thank you. Astronauts. Up the Grove. Member of the Grove. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I assume, Mary, that this has flexibility, given that it's a motion to the executive to somehow account for any potential conflicts. Should. One person's right, you know, new ability to set up tables. Impact. Other peoples, something other than a traffic flow was the only thing. But I'm if it reduces the number of parking spaces or creates noise for a business next door. I mean, is there I don't think it'll be a problem, but I assume we don't get in that level of detail here, that we just ask the executive to come up with a way to do this? Yes, that's correct. Councilmember, this motion would just ask the executive to implement the appropriate regulations and again, to do them in a way that doesn't require additional permits or fees during the Safe Start reopening period. Executive staff have noted that there would be essentially additional complications for businesses expanding into the right of way that would have to do with access and, you know, to maintain appropriate ADA access, for instance. And so all of those would, of course, have to be looked into as part of the permitting process. And this motion would ask the executive to take those steps. Okay, thanks. Further questions. Obuchi. Councilmember Vale Dewji. I think this is. A great idea. Thank you to the sponsor and the co-sponsor. And I just want to ask, is it something that's written in a way that we could update the code so that there are opportunities to allow this sort of activity even when we are beyond like COVID one, just just because it's a good thing to do. I would love to see that as well. I wouldn't say no because it wasn't in there. But it would be great if it was something that was permissive where you could see more outdoor eating and encourage more outdoor activity this way into the future. Thank you. Council Member The motion as written would sunset these temporary and more expansive opportunities. At the time that the county enters phase four, however, it does ask the executive to prepare any needed legislation to implement them. And so it would certainly be something that were there to be additional legislation. The Council could choose to keep it in force or to evaluate it at such time as we get back to normal life. Thank you. Thank you for that question. Councilmember Bell duty for further questions to preference to those who often complimented the sponsors of the motion. Councilmember Dombrowski I do want to compliment the sponsors and let it be known that I will accept any invitation for al fresco dining for many of my colleagues in their districts pursuant to this legislation. And I'll buy the first round. Very good. With that, I see no more questions. This was an idea that I started to work on, and I was obviously not thinking as big as Councilmember Lambert, who always things very big because I was only thinking restaurants. It was her idea to make sure we were including retail as well. Councilmember Lambert Promotion. Mr. Jack, pleasure working with you. I'd like to make a motion that we that we pass ordinance 2020 0208 with a DE Pass recommendation. Councilmember Lambert has moved to the we get a do pass recommendation the motion 2020 208. Discussion Council member Lambert. Thank you well and to the just ears back council member. I'm a beauty. I will enjoy eating with you afterwards and the speaker and speaker after that. And we will look for how many rounds. But this is important. I would like to thank the city of Spokane. They had the legislation and had put together quite a extensive book on what their thinking process were. And so we were able to get a lot of information that might be helpful in going forward if you choose to do this. After we get the phase four and this will help our businesses that are having a huge struggle being sustainable to have more options of being able to keep their businesses. So I look forward to more evenings out and having a nice dinner or something. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Further discussion. Say, No, no, that's the court to please call the roll.

All right. Proceeding along. There are no presentations this evening. There are no communications. There is one proclamation being read this evening. Counsel Pro Tem Torres, will you please read Proclamation 20 1-1202. Thank you, Madam President. Proclamation number 21, dash 1202 in observance of the sixth annual Indigenous People's Day in city and County of Denver. Whereas the Council of the City and County of Denver recognizes that the indigenous peoples have lived and flourished on the lands known as the Americas since time immemorial, and that Denver and the surrounding communities are built upon the ancestral homelands of numerous indigenous tribes, including the southern Ute, Ute mountain tribes of Colorado. And. Whereas, the tribal homelands and seasonal encampments of the Arapaho and Cheyenne peoples along the banks of the Cherry Creek and South Platte River in Confluence gave bearing to future settlements that would become the birthplace of the Mile High City. And. Whereas, Colorado encompasses ancestral homelands of 48 tribes, and the city and county of Denver and surrounding communities are home to descendants of approximately 100 tribal nations. And. WHEREAS, on October 3rd, 2016, the Council of the City and County of Denver unanimously passed Council Bill 16, Dash 801, officially designating the second Monday in October of each year as Indigenous Peoples Day in Denver, Colorado. And. Whereas, the Council of the City and County of Denver continues to recognize and value the best contributions made to the community through indigenous peoples knowledge, science, philosophy, arts and culture. And through these contributions, the City of Denver has developed and thrived. And. WHEREAS, the Council of the City and County of Denver acknowledges that the health, wellness and safety of our indigenous community is of paramount importance for current and future generations to thrive and contribute to our whole community. And. Whereas, in the vein of promoting wellness, healing and Safety, it was an indigenous community members diligence persistence that exposed an active and nearly 150 year old state proclamation that threatened the health and personal safety of the Indigenous community. And. Whereas, that same Indigenous community members leadership brought formal and public rescission of that ongoing historical trauma contributor. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council, the city and county of Denver, the that the Council of the City and County of Denver celebrates and honors its cultural and foundational contributions of indigenous people to our past, present and future, and continues to promote the education of the Denver community about these historical and contemporary contributions of indigenous people. That the city and county of Denver, Colorado does hereby observe October 11th, 2021, as Indigenous Peoples Day, and that the city and the Kirk of the city and county of Denver shall attest and affixed the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that the copy be transmitted to the American Indian Commission and the Colorado Commission on Indian Affairs. Thank you, Counselor Pro Tem Torres. Your motion to adopt. I move that proclamation 20 1-12. Oh, to be adopted. Thank you. It's been moved and seconded. Comments by members of Council Counsel Pro Tem Torres. Thank you, Madam President. It is an honor to continue to acknowledge today through proclamation. It was our District three predecessor, now Clerk Lopez, who carried this bill with the work of the American Indian Commission. So I thank them, I think his work. But overall, I really do think that community for ensuring we are reflective, we are accountable and we are transparent when it comes to acknowledging, correcting, including and prioritizing our indigenous community in Denver. So thank you to the commission. Thank you to Rick Williams and your family. And thank you to all of our organizations who carry on this work. Thank you. Council Pro-Tem Torres. Councilwoman Ortega. Sorry. I'm not sure if that's on. So I'm sure now. Okay, go ahead. Gentlemen, tourists, thank you for bringing this forward again this year. I think it's important to acknowledge the presence and contributions that our native community has contributed to the city of Denver. Our our history originated down at the Confluence Park. And speaking of Parks Councilwoman Commission, I have served on a committee that has looked at a number of our city parks and other properties that have looked at whether we should be renaming or reframing and educating our community. And there are a number of those that have been recommended to move forward to the Parks Department for some renaming. And so that is in follow up to a lot of this work that has continued since Councilman Paul Lopez brought this forward. So I just want to acknowledge that and those of you who have been part of those discussions. So thank you very much. Madam President. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. And I'll just go ahead and chime in here. I really appreciate my colleague, Council Pro Tem Torres, continuing on this tradition and sponsoring this proclamation. It's very important and it provides the correct history that we want to make sure and continue on within our communities and really appreciate all of the support and work that our partners, especially our commission and community members, continue on doing this work to make sure that we are acknowledging folks in the proper way. And so with that being said, Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Sandoval. I. Torres I. Last class if1i Herndon. I High High. Cashman. High. Kinney. I. Ortega Sawyer I Madam President. I Madam Secretary, close the voting and announce the results. 12 Hours. 12 eyes Proclamation 20 1-1 to oh two has been adopted. Counsel Pro Tem Torres will go ahead and start the timer. But I understand we've got a few more folks this evening. And so we want to give people the respect and time to accept this proclamation. And so we'll go ahead and hand it over to you. Thank you so much. And it's my honor to welcome up Christina maldonado, Bad Hand and Danielle Walker, co-chairs of the American Indian Commission. All right. Okay. Right. Thank you. I'm Cristina maldonado, Barron and co-chair the Denver American Indian Commission. My parents have been a part of the Denver community and native community for a long time, and now me being their youngest, being here is a very meaningful thing for me. And I will let Daniel Andrews. I'm here to stay quiet, be washed and to be with you. My chappy, my papa Lakota not E-R was lata. Not a tradition going in Manhattan, Denver, Colorado, L.A.. I greet you all, my relatives. I My name is Danielle Skywalker. I am Papa Lakota from the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, or also known as the great Sue Nation of the North Dakota. And I just really want to say thank you so much for recognizing indigenous people. Recognizing that we're still here, we're still contributing in very good, positive, thriving ways in this community, and we will continue. To do so. Thank you so much. And now we'd like to introduce Rick Williams, who is an elder in our community, to come up and say some words as well. And I just want to say, as he's coming up here, that he was the one that led the charge of the 157 year old banishing that proclamation where it made it legal until August of 2021 to kill Native Americans. And he was the one that decided that that's absolutely wrong. And we can't even believe that that was part of current day history. Oh my, don't calliope, let alone better. Leila Washtenaw Indigenous Day is a very good thing. It's been a long time coming. My great, great great. Grandfather was Whitehorse. He was part of the military societies that lived here for generations and generations and generations. When I learned, I wanted to learn more about him. And when I started that investigation, I found the proclamation that was still a law that allowed citizens of Colorado to kill Indians. We got it removed was a great victory. But it's only the beginning. I challenge each and every one of you to read two books. The huge must go and chief left hand, and you will learn the real history of Colorado. You will learn that. The city of Denver. Was culpable. In the taking of Indian land in 1861. You will learn that. This land that we're living on right now. Was disputed by a federal district attorney who said this land was never ceded and nothing was ever done about it. You will learn a lot. About the history of Colorado, but I think most of all. And it's you know, it's really sad to know that because of this history, there were no reservations on the front range of Colorado nor on the Eastern Plains. And it was because of one word genocide. All of the proclamations. Led to the Sand Creek massacre, which virtually eliminated the people from the Eastern Plains and the front range. And that's the legacy we have today. I thank you again. I appreciate it. In Oklahoma, Dr. Roxie Romulo. Now. I'd also like to welcome Rafael Maldonado back and he is our artist recipient for Artist Award 2020. I am off. I am running out of bad hand. I am an indigenous American comic artist. I do have some work here that I'd like to share. Assuming I can figure it out. I've never been good at this stuff, so I apologize. Um. I created a book called Pia, and the lead character is a nine year old little girl who is surviving on her own in a post-apocalyptic world where everything is just kind of gone to the wayside. And we are now prey for every little, little and big creatures that are around. She gets separated from her dad, and she's surviving by learning the lessons that he was teaching her throughout their childhood and now trying to find him on her own. So all these little creatures kind of just represent the struggles that our children are going through currently in life. It's also a book to represent the strength that our children have and the fact that they can carry on and the surprises that they have to show us as parents and even elders. I do collaborate with local artists and artists around in the US. The first cover here was actually by my wife Cristina maldonado. That hand, the second one in the row there it was by AC Kanellis. He is a local artist native. And that third one there is by Andrew Sanchez. He's out of New Mexico. And then this fourth one over here, the little cute one was by a real close friend of ours named Bob Parks. And he's a local resident as well. So I like to kind of get out and show a little more diversity with everybody. This is currently a book that I'm going to be working on with Richard Crow Song out of Seattle. It is Billy the Boy Bomb, and it takes place in the nineties and it deals with a lot of trauma that's on the reservations, but also with a superhero stick to it as well. So it's dealing with kids that are coming to terms with what's going on in their world and one boy standing up to everything and trying to right what's wrong and standing up to injustice. But yeah, that's pretty much it. I mean. And thank you very much. Yeah. Well, very good. Well, thank you all for joining us this evening. And we appreciate you sharing your stories and the work that you're continuing on and sharing the couple of books and what we can do to continue to educate ourselves about this. And so really appreciate you being here. And it's an honor to acknowledge and celebrate Indigenous Peoples Day and all the accomplishments and the history as well. Thank you. Counsel Pro Tem Torres.

So can we just hear item 18 and then 19, please? Item 18 is report from Financial Management Recommendation to receive and file fiscal year 2018 year end budget performance report and increase appropriation in several funds across several departments for various purposes to reflect final expenditures and carry cleanup citywide. Thank you, Councilwoman Longo. Thank you. I appreciate the documentation brought forward by the city staff. I'm open to hearing from my colleagues that have queued up. Yes. Do we have a staff report on this? Certainly we have a staff report from Grace Yoon, our budget manager in the finance department. Grace. Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the City Council. This is the year end performance report for FY 18 for the period ending September 30th, 2018, for all funds. The General Fund ended the year with a positive remaining funds available of 2.3 million due to proactive management of the budget revenues that were higher than previous projections that helped offset revenues that came in below budget savings targets instituted mid-year and additional departmental cost savings. In addition, there was an ending funds available about 690,000 for the UPLANDS Fund. So in accordance with City Council policy, the city manager is proposing that 5% of the surplus be set aside for unfunded liabilities. Also, per the Fy19 Budget Adoption City Council approved the use of the first 305,000 of the FY18 surplus to fund various contingent appropriation. City manager is also proposing to set aside funds to honor the request of the Legislative Department, the city auditor's office and the city prosecutor's office to set aside and reprogram their department savings for FY 18. Additionally, the city manager is proposing to set aside funds for community hospital and armory holding costs. Continuation of Sunday library hours. Phase three of the Coyote Study, Emergency Maintenance, Mobile Technology for the Police Department and Homelessness efforts support measure A was also good news. This year there was a surplus of 7.9 million of measure funds beyond what was anticipated and allocated through the Fy19 measure a plan. The city manager is proposing that these funds be reserved and appropriated in Fy19 to ensure key measure eight and other infrastructure projects are not deferred from their original schedules. To move up key projects earlier in the schedule and to carry over some of the savings in administration for educational materials. These recommended recommendations will also be reviewed with the Citizens Advisory Committee on February 26 to confirm that the recommended uses conform with the resolution of intent for measure a spending. This report also includes recommended uses for the Tidelands funds available at the end of a 1518, as well as budget adjustments and the Tidelands Oil Revenue Fund and Upland Oil Fund to align actuals to budget offset by oil revenue. There are no other revenues or expenditure concerns to report at this time, and this concludes the staff report and I'm available for any questions. Thank you, Councilman Michael. He was reluctant public coming first as anyone would like to speak on this item. You're not. Go ahead. Yes, go ahead. I'm not exactly clear about the 7.9. Is it $7.9 million surplus for Missouri? Oh, okay. Well, I just caught this while you were talking about it. And it it's my understanding that you haven't decided what to do with that money yet. So I would like to propose that you take $3.5 million and get SPCA play out of that building over there at the shelter and put the rest of the shelter people in there so we could expand services for the animals in Long Beach. I don't know if there's any other surplus on any other measures, but since it hasn't been decided what to do with that money yet, you could do at least $3.5 million to help clean up that whole problem over there. That's my suggestion. Thank you. Thank you. To hear more comments. Nina in Dallas, Councilman Nina Gonzalez. Yes. Thank you so much for the report. I am wondering if this would be a good opportunity. It doesn't seem like there's a lot extra left, but $52,000 for digital inclusion, strategic planning. Now that it is a city wide initiative, it would be great to include that here or I don't know if it needs to be done at a later time. But I just wanted to throw that out. What would be the best option? So this is specifically infrastructure funding and the $7 million. It's carryover from Measure eight. But what I would be happy. To do in a strategic planning, though. That's the first part. The second part. What I would be open to doing through a friendly is to itemize that for the next BOC meeting. For us to look at rolling that into what other options we have for the upcoming fiscal year that work. Sure. Can I also hear from my city manager as well? Or Grace, our budget manager. Yes. So the year end performance report includes recommended uses of both measure a surplus and general fund surplus that's available. So recommendations on the uses of general fund surplus and measure is is in the report for council to discuss. So I guess to do the 52,000, we would have to defend something else in the report because all of the funding has been associated. Is there a specific thing you'd like to move money from into? So maybe let me ask this question instead to kind of pull back. And what was the because now that it is a city wide initiative, I would like to know what kind of plan we have in terms of funding that we want to kind of move forward. We've already had two roundtables. This is a very important initiative, and I'm just wondering where where this might be on the priority list? I think it is a priority. I think we have teams that are working without. At this stage, though, we have not been proposing to bring on board a consultant or anything for the digital divide. If that was something that city council wanted to do, here are the dollars tonight or in A or C meeting. They can reallocate that. But certainly it is something that our Technology Services Department continues to work on and it's a high priority of them. Okay. So perhaps I'll just agenda is that separately, we'll move forward tonight and then we'll have two separate discussions on what we can do going going forward. But thank you very much. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman, Mongo. Here's. Councilwoman Pierce. Thank you. I I wanted to follow up on that question. Since it's digital inclusion, none of that could come from Measure eight. It would all have to come from general fund, is that correct? Because it's a consultant for. Some measure, A is for public safety by the resolution of the council, public safety and infrastructure. Sure. I think digital inclusion is infrastructure. But I just wanted to clarify. But I also support if you're going to bring that back, we can talk about it. But that was I was just queuing up for that. And I did want to point out that the the technology and an innovation commission will actually be returning to you with a report on a lot of the digital divide strategies that we that should be available next week. And that kind of lays out a roadmap. We don't have funding associated with those yet, but we would if the council really is excited by that, we would then take that and put that into an implementation plan. And I did. I have one other question on the Sunday library hours. I just know that we talked about the main library when it's open having Sunday library hours. So I just want to echo and make sure that that doesn't get lost. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you very much, Councilman Austin. I second the motion. I'm glad that we can actually talk about carryover and surplus from the previous year, particularly what it measure, eh? I see a number of great projects that will be funded, you know, during our B or C meeting. I certainly reiterated Park Equity and I certainly hope that we can continue along that that along that cord when we are looking at a future funding for for projects throughout the city. But it of the $7.9 million I think you know, a lot of the districts and a lot of our residents are going to see significant improvements in their neighborhoods. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Councilman Mongo, thank you. I really appreciate all the work that went into this. The city staff did excellent work. I know there's a lot of projects on the list and I know there's a lot of need. Park bathrooms are huge. We need to continue to invest in our infrastructure. If you were here for the presentation, you heard the billions of dollars in backlog of infrastructure that we have. And so this is a step in the right direction. And I appreciate my colleagues support on this item and the work of the boss. Thank you very much. Any comments apologizes?

Whereas, Denver Stormwater affects these important local resources, municipal stormwater runoff must be controlled as part of the Clean Water Act. Compliance and the people of Denver can help reduce pollution through thoughtful actions. And. WHEREAS, the city and County of Denver strives to operate an excellent municipal, separate stormwater sewer system, of which public education and outreach is the first required control measure. And. Whereas, Denver Public Works has partnered with local nonprofit organization Earth Force since 2012 to design and implement the innovative Keep It Clean Neighborhood Environment Trio's kick net program of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education for teachers and students in Denver and its neighboring municipalities. And. WHEREAS, Kyknet has been adopted in 24 schools and resulted in 63 student led environmental action projects to date and will continue to reach more than 1500 students and 100 teachers annually as they conduct watershed investigations and make improvements in our urban waterways. Now, therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver, Section one, that the Council of the City and County of Denver congratulates Denver Public Works and earthworks on the awarding of a 2016 achievement award for Kyknet in the category of civic education and Public Information, which was given July 24th, 2016, in Long Beach, California, Section two that the Clerk of the city and County of Denver attest and affects the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be transmitted to the Executive Director of Public Works. And I will move that proclamation. 544 be adopted. It has been moved and seconded and so we'll move on to comments. And again, since this is my proclamation, I'll start. As many people know, the South Platte River is near and dear to my heart. It's I got a job when I was 17 years old working on the South Platte River in the Cherry Creek and fell in love. And that's the work I did for my entire life before I landed here and got to work with this program, keep it clean from drain the stream and the kidnap program and Darren and Donnie. And it's a phenomenal program. And it's something that those of us who have been quite literally almost baptized in the South Platte River forget that the very basics of how our stormwater system work is not common knowledge. And I was sitting at the parade, the St Patrick's Day parade, five, six, seven years ago, now sitting there on the curb with my wife and my two kids watching the parade go by. And I just happened to be sitting right on top of one of our storm drains, which anything that goes in that storm drain goes right into the South Platte River. We were in downtown right, right over there with no filtration. Whatever goes down there goes straight into the river and people don't know that. And there was a woman walking in the parade carrying a piece of trash. And before I even knew what was happening, she took that piece of trash, said, Oh, thank goodness, and threw it right underneath me into the storm drain. She clearly made the choice to not litter, to not let that piece of trash go there. She was trying to throw it away and yet had no understanding that by putting it in there, she had fast tracked it to not only be a piece of litter blowing around in downtown Denver, but to being a piece of trash floating around in our most precious natural resource. And so that kind of education is so critical to teach our kids about how our storm system works, about the health of the South Platte River, and then to empower them with real things that they can do to make a difference. And this that's what this program does. And that's why this program won an award. And so I'm so excited to bring that up and recognize you guys for all of your hard work being one of the best at educating our citizens and our kids when it comes to these important issues on the South by river. So that's my comment. Are there any other comments from members of council? Seeing none. Madam Secretary, Roll Call. Black Eye Espinosa I Flynn I Gilmore, I Cashman. Kenny Lopez. I knew Ortega.

Come on up to say a few words and accept the proclamation. Thank you for this recognition council. I was very happy to represent city and county of Denver yesterday at the National Association of Counties and accept the award. And I would like to let you know that tomorrow I'm traveling to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to share our program with them. So I thank you for the support that you've given us over the years and look forward to many more years of support and a special nod of appreciation to my fellow environmental educators on Council. Councilman Clark and Councilwoman Gilmore. I'm Daramola do I've been. In. Charge of this program. For many, many years, and I tell you, we couldn't actually do without our community based organizations here in Denver. And in reality, as engineers aren't necessarily the best educators, we've got to get the right people in the room to actually work with the Denver Public Schools in addition to the general community and Public Works is is really proud of this program. It's good to see we've won a national award, but ultimately we couldn't have done this with or without. Our partners, Earth. Force, the regional EPA members and some of the grant funding they assisted us with. And we look at adopting this program wholly into public works in the future. So this will continue on for generations upon generations. And the student base is also benefiting the citizenry by providing these community actions. So in the near future, we're going to ask you guys to come on out and get to play in the water a little bit. So be prepared for our invites. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thank you.

The members of the City Council, property owners of record located in the Uptown Pivot area who will pay more than 50% of the proposed assessment, have submitted petitions to the city for the reestablishment of the Uptown Pivot . The Uptown Pivot Management District Plan details the boundaries of the Uptown Pivot. The method of assessment for each parcel and the improvements and activities for which assessment funds will be used. The assessment methodology will generate approximately 177 $356 in revenue for the Uptown Peabody during its first year. If reestablished, the Uptown period will exist for a ten year period between January 2019 and December 2028, and the City Council will annually review and consider approving the renewal of the levy. Budgets and reports submitted by the Association managing the Uptown Pivot as approved by City Council Action on June 12, 2018. A notice of assessment and an assessment ballot were mailed to property owners who are proposed to be assessed. Ballots are weighted by assessment amounts. At the conclusion of this public hearing, the city will tabulate the votes and will return to the City Council later during the August seven, 2018 meeting to announce the results. If there is not a majority protest from property owners, the City Council may adopt resolution reestablishing the uptown period. If the uptown pivot is reestablished, the Uptown Property and Community Association will continue to manage the Uptown Pivot and shall serve as a owners association. That concludes my staff report. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and do public comment on this hearing. Is there any public comment on the hearing? Please come forward. I'm wondering, Miss Webber, should I have the ballots be delivered first to the clerk, or should we do the here? The ballots can be delivered to you up to the close of the public hearing. Okay.

My name is Larry DeJesus and I, along with Mr. Bruce Stewart on the property at 1000 and 1030 Artesia. During the past five years, we've paid about $10,000 in property taxes. Five years ago. 73% of the property owners voted against the establishment of the period that it was passed because the city and school district properties represent more than 85% of the yes vote. What I didn't know at the time. Was that those owners. East of Orange, 600 feet away, got to opt out. I was not given the opportunity. To opt out. Last December. Laura dowd completed an audit. She found that the city did not pay its bid tax for 2016. $58,000 was not paid. What the management. Of our people was doing. I don't know the reestablishment of the pyramid. This time will take. $22,000. From us. One of our buildings needs. A new roof. That 22,000 could pay for the roof. I think the city needs to reexamine the composition of the building. I think the city should think about let us opt out. That is my request. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Honorable mayor. City council members. Thank you. That's appropriate. I just briefly wanted to state that I am greatly honored to have been working with Councilmember Rex Richardson and Ally Austin in the formation of this business improvement district. And before I came to work for the city, I'm now retired. This is way past my bedtime. Just so you know, I was a stockbroker and my mentor said to me, and this is a note for any potential investors in Uptown. He said, Jimmy, what you want to do, you want to be on the beach with your oars in the sand waiting for the tide to come in because things are happening uptown. And I tell you, it's going to be well, like Rick said back then, renaissance things are really happening and it's going to be a great place to live, work and play. So I'm pretty proud of this. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Good afternoon, Mr. Mayor. City council members, members of the community, my fellow colleagues and friends, thank you for this opportunity to speak on behalf of the Uptown Business Improvement District. My name is Portia Darvish, and I'm a real estate owner in the city of Long Beach with properties in the Bixby Knolls and North Long Beach submarkets. I'm also a board member of the Uptown Business Improvement District, a commercial real estate broker by trade, and an involved community member by choice. Prior to being a board member of the Business Improvement District, I thought this organization, Soul Charter, was to organize weekly happy hours and chili cook offs, although other bids in other cities may do that. Certainly this is not the agenda for North Long Beach, led by our executive director, Tasha Hunter. The North Long Beach bid works effortlessly to solve real life problems for members of our community. Spend a day with Tasha Hunter at her office in the heart of North Long Beach, and you'll feel an ounce of the sheer weight she carries on her shoulders daily. Her days are filled, taking calls from real life citizens that rely on the bid and her leadership to keep them afloat. Like the El Salvadorian bakery owner that has no idea how to obtain a permit for their business. They come to Tasha because they know she'll take the time to drive them to the city, help them fill out the necessary applications in Spanish to get their permits. Or like the local merchant that calls Tasha before they call the police department to deal with a crime being committed near their store. Knowing she'll know what to do, spend a day with her and you'll hear her voice speaking to several private nonprofit companies she employs to keep North Long Beach clean. Picking up thousands of pounds of trash along the Atlantic and Artesia corridors on a weekly basis. Or hear her meeting with the private security company, reporting the weekly crime report and discussing ways they can collectively keep crime down within the city. And yes, spend a day with her. And you hear her promoting the local retailers and restaurants and the occasional chili cook off in our community. I can go on and on about the different ways she makes a difference in the lives of the local property owners, merchants and residents of North Long Beach. She is, in essence, a friendly face to go to go to when there's no one else to go to. So in other words, Tasha Hunter and the Business Improvement District, for lack of a better analogy, is somewhat a city within the city. We are the Planning Department, the Economic Development Police Department, Waste Management and and Waste Management at the local level. Although our first priority are the members of our district, we strive to make sure members of our community are abiding by city ordinances and following the rules of this Council puts forth. With that said, the Business Improvement District is the meeting place in which Tasha and the rest of the board members discuss and execute this noble agenda . That is our responsibility. The board is a forum where property owners, residents, business owners, city representatives, law enforcement, council members, private businesses, developers, and anyone else that wants a voice in our community can send a message. Each board member spends time out of their day, week and month helping to build without compensation, I should add, because we all believe in the cause. Allow me to convey to you. Thank you so much. It's correct the time. Okay. Thank you so much. Next speaker, please. Tom Carpenter with Frontier Real Estate Investments. Good evening, Honorable Mayor City Council. I wish I could just echo what Pasha just said and give him my time. He was on a good roll there, but I just wanted to say we're developing the property at Atlantic and Artesia, our Uptown Commons project. We're making a sizable financial investment into our project. And ultimately, you know, we feel the area and that's because we believe in what's going on in the area spearheaded by Councilmember Richardson. And like like Porsha was saying, this bid does so many different positive things for the area. What Portia is able to accomplish out of her office in the district is is a huge win for the entire area. So as somebody who is making a sizable investment looks at this from a very long term view, we're all for the bid. We're really excited. We're appreciative to everybody who has put in time to make this happen. And thank you to Tosha for all she does. And thank you for your consideration of this. I think it's a total win for the area and we're excited about it. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Next speaker. Good evening, everyone. My name is Mike. I'm a ninth district resident for 15 years now. A year ago, I had no idea what a bid was, didn't know what a business improvement district did. But in traveling the you know, the district up and down Atlantic Avenue for as long as I have, I noticed things changing and I was curious. And so I found out and knocked on his door one time in her office and got to know her and had the unique couple of unique experiences of actually like canvasing the streets with her and visiting her, her business owners, inviting them out to I think it was a roundtable breakfast meeting of some sort. But we had it was very encouraging to see the response. She got just the warm welcome she got from all the people that we went to see. It was like an old relative had entered the building. So it was I just knew that she was, you know, a friend to them to to all of us. And the work that's being done was well appreciated. So this month, I take. Thanks so much, Mike. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Mayor. Vice Mayor, City Council, city staff. I'm Tasha Hunter. And I didn't expect to get emotional. But I get. Emotional. This right here and I always go off book when I come here. So thank you all for all the work. This is not just the work that I've done. This is the work of community members, of the property owners that are willing to talk and listen. The business owners, all of which I walk that bed every single last day to get to know my business owners. This is something that I had a great job before at Lumby City College, and when this opportunity to came, came up, I knew it was for me the flexibility and the engagement to put all my talents to work. I just want to say that Councilman Austin, when I first moved to Long Beach, I'm not always. I have not. Always lived in Long Beach, but when I first came to Long Beach, getting my first leadership opportunity, working with Long Beach camp and from there and has introduced me to a lot of things from there I'm very appreciative. But this is about our property owners and I just have to say that I'm so thankful to all the property owners that. Have invested in North Long. Beach a long time ago. I get those calls from people that have owned. Property. For, you know, the early twenties and for all of the property owners, a couple of which have spoken today that see the potential, see the culture, see the possibilities, the potential, see the vision of where our city is going and choose to. Invest in North. Beach and appreciative. And I'm hoping that all the hard. Work and dedication. We'll show in today's results of these tablet the tabulation of ballots. Like I said, I went off book. I've been in this job for two years, five months, six days and 7. Hours feels like although. I was out there for the implementation or the building of the bid. But there are a lot of. People that help put this. Together. Councilman Richardson, who helped spearhead the project and Councilman Austin who calls it. They call this their baby. Well, and I've often said. I've taken that baby, I've adopted that baby, and I love that baby just the same way the two of you did when you created an engine first. Thank you, Jim. First for all the hard. Work that you did at the city. Did he leave the all the hard work that you did at the city and continue on to come on board as a consultant for us? I have 40 seconds left. Oh, my goodness gracious. At the time. Go. So thank you, counsel. And to Stephen Neal, my board members who have been very dedicated. I have to say a special thank you to COBA Council of Business Associates. They bless you. That is not about you. Can I have four more seconds for blessing? There was not a binder about. What the bid processes are, but through. The through the work of our. City auditor like Lord Dowd. There's going to be a big binder. My big binder for the policies and procedure. Were minor. Often. From our Midtown. Business Improvement District, Blair Cohn from our Bixby, Craig, coach, and all the other people that have come together answered my question for every single department in the city that have answer my question. So thank you all. Thank you. And let's say a prayer. Thank you. Thank you very much for the comments, everyone that came forward. We're going to go ahead and close public comments and the hearing. And then the matter is paused. I know for ballots to be tabulated. And how long will that take? About an hour after we come back to this issue at Apple. We'll come back to this after the next item as we tabulate. And so we will hold this item and hold it to you. Mr. Weber, do we just hold this hearing or do we need to continue to close the hearing? Or you can close the hearing and the the madam matter will stay recessed until we return with the tabulation of the ballots. And at that time, it will be appropriate to adopt the resolution or not, depending on the results and counting. RICHARDSON And Councilman Austin, do you want to make your comments now or after the ballots? I think they've said enough. We can do it after we see the results. Okay, great. So then we'll go ahead and conclude the hearing and keep it keep it open until we come back with the results of the balloting. So thank you to everyone that came and spoke. That concludes the hearings and the presentations for the evening.","Recommendation to receive supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing to consider the re-establishment of the Uptown Property and Business Improvement District (UPBID); direct the City Clerk to tabulate the ballots and report the results of the tabulation to the Mayor and City Council during the August 7, 2018 meeting; and, if a majority of ballots received are in favor of the establishment of the UPBID, adopt resolution to re-establish the UPBID for a term of ten years, effective January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2028.

Yes. Okay. So, whereas quality, affordable housing is vital to healthy, safe, vibrant and diverse communities. And I'm going to skip some of the warehouses and affordable homes, the solution to homelessness and provide support to seniors, families, youth veterans and people with disabilities. And. Whereas, rising housing costs have led longtime residents to be displaced, live in overcrowded and substandard homes, or become homeless, threatening our region's diversity and economic prosperity, and creating new, permanently affordable homes. And preserving and improving existing housing helps our residents maintain community roots and encourages racial and economic diversity for generations. And where is affordable homes close to public transit and jobs reduces reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide low income families better access to opportunities and amenities. And empowering and engaging local resident leaders helps create better housing, tenant protections and development policies. And. WHEREAS, nonprofit organizations, local jurisdictions, community organizations, faith based groups, and many others continue to build inclusive communities by providing shelter, homes and support for low income people and those with special needs. And. Whereas, local jurisdictions such as Alameda County and the City of Alameda play an important role by providing local resources for affordable housing to leverage federal, state and other funds. And. WHEREAS, East Bay housing organizations have organized affordable housing week for 23 years, and this year will feature 17 events in nine cities acknowledging the need for, for and benefits of affordable housing. Now therefore be resolved that I Maryland, as the Ashcraft mayor of the city of Alameda, do hereby proclaim May 19 to the ninth, May 9th to the 19th, 2019 as the 23rd Annual Affordable Housing Week in Alameda, where we will work to support affordable housing at the local, regional and state level. We encourage residents to participate in affordable housing week activities. So I just want to say quickly before I turn the microphone over to these distinguished women that we could not do what we're doing without the help of our partners every day. The Housing Authority are such heroes. I want you to know that I was in Washington, DC last week and I was at the Veterans Administration and we had on the speakerphone a woman from Los Angeles who is working on veterans housing issues in our region. And she just wanted to say what a stellar job our housing authority and Vanessa Cooper did. And she's so she knew about the vast vouchers that have gone into our most recently opened affordable housing projects. So from from Washington, D.C. and I was proud to tell them we're going to be doing all that and more. And both of you have done so much in your own right. So thank you. Thank you for helping house our nee our region's most needy residents. So who wants to take the microphone and then you can actually turn it around the normal way it. Good evening. I'm Laura Thomas, and I'm here as a representative of renewed hope housing advocates. And I'm also a member of East Bay housing organizations, ABAJO, which is putting on affordable housing week. 35 years old, it has 500 members, including the city of Alameda. It's a nonprofit working to preserve and create affordable housing through education, advocacy, organization and coalition building. And it's an invaluable. Resource for everybody in the bay in the East. Bay working for affordable housing. I know. That we in renewed hope over the last. 20 years, actually probably only the last ten that we've called on them. But whenever we need help on the issues that we don't have any expertize on, they step in to help us and they in turn look to us local advocates up and down the East Bay to keep them apprized. Of the. Particular dynamics of a given place. And so together, along with everybody in government and industry who shares the values of building affordable housing, we're all. Striving to make sure that the human character of the. East Bay can be maintained. So your recognition of affordable housing today supports your ongoing commitment to affordable housing. You were supportive of affordable housing week. Excuse me. So starting on Friday and through next week, there are the the events. And I'm going to give you the schedule. In Alameda, we're going to have the senior disability committee will have a forum on Monday at 1:00 in the main library. And I think Tony Graham will come and tell you later what that's going to be about. The other events are groundbreaking and open houses that showcase the success we've had in the Bay Area. We've built some beautiful progress projects, and even despite the fierce competition, there is for any scrap of land that can be translated into a market rate project. But we appreciate that that wealth is being generated. But as long as it has to offer some. Benefits, it has to offer benefits to the Bay Area residents. Whose families have also invested. Decades of hard work and their desire to build a life for themselves. And they have built the Bay Area. And they have nurtured this place. And in directing some of that wealth to building affordable housing, we are making sure that this highly valued housing boom. Actually builds equity and. Justice. So affordable homes for all is the theme. And it does seem apropos since the housing crisis we're in could actually also be termed a displacement crisis. And we can congratulate ourselves in Alameda. Truly for overcoming the fear of taking care of people and passing measure. Last month. And I hope we can see strong protections for renters passed soon. I think by improving rent protection, affordable housing and improving facilities like the medical respite center, we can bring stability, less fear, and we can also create the ability Farallon. Needed to foster more projects. I'm sure we can we can. Do it can be done. We can take care of people. I don't know what choice we have because we did some. Time back declare that everybody is welcome here. So I thank you for standing firm on all of these issues. Thank you. And would you like to speak on behalf of both parties? We have this one. We have. Oh. We can give you a glass. On behalf of East Bay housing organizations. I too want to thank the Alameda City Council and Mayor Ashcraft for recognizing our affordable housing week and invite all of you to our many events this week and to our kick off this coming Thursday evening at Classic Cars West in uptown Oakland. We hope to. See many of you. And we know that it's only with the partnership of our members, like renewed hope in Alameda, the housing authority here in Alameda, and our supportive elected officials and other individuals that we can together solve the housing needs for these parties. So thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. All right. With that. Okay. Wait. Photoshop for Sarah. Everyone, quickly. Oh, yeah. Here, take that. Yeah. Thank you. We have speakers on the. Yes. Do you want to? Either way. Whatever you want. It's yeah. Some pretty. All right. So our our next proclamation is for Small Business Week. And we actually have. Several representatives, right?

We had an opportunity to be briefed by Katrina, as you heard Councilmember Lewis describe this morning. This ordinance really provides an enforcement mechanism for the city to actually create a system by which to enforce any potential violations of civil emergency orders that have been or will be issued now or in the future.

This is an opportunity for us to create some civil mechanisms by which to create enforcement of those emergency orders. And and today we have an opportunity to consider this.

Ability to issue or to pursue civil infractions. For violation of emergency orders. Well, we need to go back and update the previously enacted emergency orders to reflect this this new authority. I'm currently working on that councilmember verballed with the mayor's office. We we probably don't need to I mean, it goes without saying, and I don't know if this is the basis of your question, but the law cannot apply retroactively to violations that had already occurred if they had. But so I think going forward, you know, once these, you know, go into effect, you know, folks will be on notice that this is a potential impact. But, you know, we're seeing it maybe it makes sense to to reissue the orders or to to somehow modify them to be in compliance.

Heirs of Sarah Arpels second edition, the committee recommends for council to grant the petition as conditioned. Thank you, Councilmember Rasmussen. Thank you. This would grant conditional approval of an early vacation in BLOCK 24 is also sometimes known as the Enterprise car rental site at Ninth and Leonora. It's a bit unusual in that the application for the vacation has been made jointly between the private developer guide development and our Seattle Parks Department. Each of the petitioners would take about half of the 2400 square foot alley in the block. The developer private developer guide would take one half of the alley to complete a 400 unit, 400 foot tall residential building on the north side of the block. And the park department would take the other half of the alley to complete a much needed new 10,000 square foot park on the south side of the lot, alongside Westlake Avenue and Leonora Street. It would feature an open lawn and an activity area, place, structure, hillclimb and seating for gathering picnics and general leisure. The Disney Triangle Urban Center Village is being heavily developed, as you know, and more office space will be needed and welcome in this neighborhood all along. Westlake. While the two projects are separate, Jedi and the Parks Department are working closely to design and coordinate the development of this public park. Without a vacation, the opportunity for a complimentary design between the two groups would be lost and the alley would continue to be used for vehicular traffic and would actually be a detriment and a barrier between the residential tower and the new park. With the early vacation, there is an opportunity for many more amenities to be expanded on the block and better public use and public access to the park. Thank you. Questions or comments? Councilmember BENSHOFF. Just one. Councilmember Rasmussen, the last piece of legislation you mentioned that more bicycle racks were going to be added at the location. And I didn't hear you say that this time, but I would like to encourage us to do that where possible. I'm finding that more often than not I am locking my bike to a tree downtown, and if we're really encouraging people to use our spaces, a few more bicycle racks around would be very helpful. Thank you. I believe the the ballot measure that we just approved going to the voters will actually include funding for many, many more bicycle. Bicycle racks. Councilmember Gordon. I just want to say that this is really a parks development. Much more in a lot of respects than a transportation project. Aside from the fact that it was necessary to do grant vacation of the alley. In order to. Do it, but it's going to be harder and harder to get the park spaces downtown. And I think it's really the design is exciting and it's. Going to be really a great. Amenity for the area, which is very heavily now developed. And it will be wonderful to have. This little green. Space in this park right on that spot. When you think about what is. There now. An alley and a car rental park part, a development that has a whole lot of cars parked there. Think about how you're going to have green grass and you're going to have an opportunity to sit out on the sidewalk. It will be quite, quite, quite a good amenity and very pleased that we can have that kind of public, private cooperation. Thank you. Please call the roll. Excuse me. This is a clerk file, so we will.

Thank you. And this I'll note quickly as a follow up to an item, a council referral that Councilmember Knox White and I brought a while ago. And so I'm I know staff has put a lot of effort. I think staff in several city departments have put a lot of effort into this. So I'm city manager Leavitt, who is who's presenting this one now. I'm Mary Elbe, assistant city manager Boden. Okay. Hello, Assistant City Manager Jerry Bowden. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, Mayor. As the Ashcraft. Members of the city council big team here tonight. Obviously our city manager and our city attorney, director of Public Works, Aaron Smith, is on the call this evening. We also have planning building transportation director Andrew Thomas. Lisa maxwell, our committee development director, may also be joining and we also have police chief, the Sean Joshi. So obviously multi departmental effort car events that are having negative impacts at Alameda point things like pedestrian and bicyclists safety. And I'll say next slide. Thank you. Pedestrian and bicyclists, safety, traffic congestion. There's concern about first responders being able to access the area during certain events that get so crowded that it might be challenging to do to be able to get folks in there. Noise, trash and property damage have also been associated with some larger scale events and those are having negative impacts on residents, businesses. And also we have an award winning climate action plan that has pretty lofty greenhouse gas reduction objectives. And so all of these things are at odds with some of the events that are happening. Next slide, please. So staff's recommendation this evening is really an attempt at striking the right balance between managing the different auto oriented events that are happening with allowing for the enjoyment of the area by residents, business, community and visitors. These four points on this slide will be discussed in more detail in the presentation tonight. Next slide, please. So as mayor, as the Ashcraft mentioned, staff did elevate this item to as a priority when the council referral came forward earlier this year. At that time, direction was given to the city manager to evaluate the situation and implement measures to mitigate or eliminate those negative impacts from certain auto oriented events occurring at Alameda Point, including the comings and goings from the point that there were also resulting in a lot of complaints and concerns from residents. So staff did identify three types of events that are happening at Alameda Point, things like city permitted events, special events, conditional use permit events that that were occurring. There are also non permitted events, informal, large scale events where hundreds of vehicles were coming through either online or just group meets. And then we're also seeing individual reckless driving. We're calling those events. Sometimes it's a couple of cars or an individual car, but those are also creating issues in the area based on our look into the situation. So next slide. We have scaled back staff has scaled back the permits that we've been issuing for auto related events at Alameda Point since the council referral in August. We did actually have a slide behind. I'll say next slide one more time, please. We did also scaled back the the permits. We also put a number of. We also look at key locations where informal event group events were or congregating for the parking lot. Next to the skate park is an example of that. And that area was the recipient, recipient of wheel stops, which are those concrete blocks that you have to stop your car at the shopping center parking lot? Those when those are installed, they deter faster moving vehicles, spinning car activities, things like that become a lot harder when the wheel stops are in place because there's just less room for that and there are physical barriers. Similarly, the south side of Building five on West Tower Avenue and the open area between the Lookout Tower and Building 25 near the end of Monarch Street, which is the street that runs north, south, west tower, west, midway, west redline all tie into monarch and monarch takes you out to the park area. Those barriers were put barriers were put in place at a number of locations. We've also had greater police presence in the area and as part of monitoring the events as they're occurring. Next slide. So this is what the area near building 25 at the end of just as you come down West Tower, if you come past palladium and keep going straight out to Spirit's Alley, West Tower cheese into monarch. And if you turn left, building 25 is is located in that area. There's a mix of rail and tree planters which kind of neck down or narrow the entrance to the larger I'll call it future deep paved park area or that larger parking lot area. This still allows bicyclists and pedestrians to navigate the area. Vehicles can still navigate through the area, but it just creates a kind of a slower entrance and exit area from the larger parking area. And that is the one of the near term solutions that were put in place, does a lot, still allows tenant access as well in that area. Next slide. So there were a number of there were obviously a number of improvements that have been put into place. Staff is wanted to take this opportunity to check in with the city council and and make a recommendation on additional refinements to our program. Obviously, the the improvements that have been put in place have been effective to some extent, but still allow for some of the negative activity or the negative impacts that were occurring through some of these activities. And so permitted events are obviously an area where we as the city have a lot more authority, land use controls and other permitting authority. So with policy direction from council staff could continue to modify or modify existing use permits or continue to more carefully monitor applications for auto related events. So that is an option for us to pursue and maybe more fully execute on. Next slide. Non permitted events continue to be more difficult to manage, even with the improvements that we've made to date, staff has developed three options that would allow for even less space for vehicle events at the end of Monarch Street. And I'm talking about the area that really extends past where that current neck down area is at Alameda Point. And I'll just briefly show each of these three options now. Next slide, please. So what we're calling barrier option one would maintain those existing vehicle barriers that north or the top end of the the of the slide shows the next down area the blue the blue barricade indicators on this map would be the the new barriers that would be put in place. And there would be mostly a complete limit of vehicle traffic beyond the barriers. This would allow for a limited amount of public and tenant parking. And then the areas that are kind of to the bottom of this slide beyond the blue barriers would be bike and pedestrian access only in option one. So this is one option for consideration. It would certainly limit any large scale vehicle events beyond those blue barriers would not be possible. It would be ten and access only. Next slide, please. Barrier. Option two is the retaining walls with which the retaining system would be maintained. Again, those blue barriers indicate the new cordoned off area, so there'd be a long, narrow road that would take you to public parking at the South End. The area that's closest to the water would be open to bicyclists and pedestrians in that parking area. At the bottom of the slide could be right sized over time to make sure that we had adequate vehicle parking but not created an attractive nuisance area at that far end. Next slide, please. So barrier option three is again really limited vehicle access tenants only beyond the tower building. And so this is the most limited and limited option. You have bicyclists and pedestrians allowed past that area. Next slide, please. Last week. The second bullet on this slide talks about the possibility of municipal code amendments. We're not recommending, though, this those this evening. There are already laws on the books that criminalize street racing, reckless driving events, and their coordinators often happen online. And that creates its own challenge in terms of resources to track people on the Internet, on social media. So we're not recommending that it is an option that we did look at one of their location that's not Deep Park is at the end of Mt. Hood, which is at the end of Monarch is the USS Hornet area across from the Wheeler facility on West Hornet Avenue. Next slide, please. This is a location that staff is recommending a temporary chain link fence, which would limit vehicle access, but still allow the city to readily lease the space for events or other uses that are deemed appropriate. And the last slide, please. So with that, staff is recommending the following actions for council consideration restrict or limit the large scale auto events. A policy direction like that would allow staff to consider applications but not facilitate events that could be problematic. Second, retain the barrier system that was put in place in August and implement the barrier option number two, which would allow for public access but restrict a larger area to just bicycle and pedestrian access. Third would be the installation of fencing across from Wheater and finally leave those wheel stops and other physical barriers that have been put in place. That concludes our presentation. Talk about perfect timing, Mr. Boden. Thank you so much. So, Madam Clerk, I'm sure we have some public speakers, but before we get to our public speakers council excuse me, we have a great array of city staff here who can answer your questions. So let's take clarifying questions at this time in Kalahari Desert. Go ahead and start a. Quick clarifying question for the the chain link fence around near the west, near the LEDA facility. Is there any reason why the chain link fence doesn't extend to cover that portion? That seems to be just right, right next to it. It looks like I think people practice motorcycle driving in that area. Is there a reason why we don't include that the chain link fence doesn't extend to that area? It's a great question. Councilmember de SAC, the the the answer to that question that we've received so far is that we think that the Hornet lease actually covers some of those other areas. And so we want to make sure we'll make sure that we align the fence and are as if council endorses this concept. We'll make sure that it's as inclusive as possible for that large area, but we don't want to infringe on anyone's rights. Thank you. Thank you. I saw a hand go up. Who was that? Councilmember Harris Spencer. Thank you. I want to follow up on member de SACS question. So sometimes the Hornet has events with a lot of people that are driving and I know they go beyond that area that's available outside of that fence. So with the area within the fencing be opened for when they're having their events. It certainly could be there. Their lease currently would not cover that area, but it's certainly something that we could talk with them and coordinate. We're in close coordination with the Hornet representatives, so if they were planning a large scale event and needed more parking, we could certainly be open to that conversation. And what we're talking about is temporary fencing that could be easily relocated or moved over time as necessary. I had Councilor Hurst answer. So I also know shopping centers have this issue too, but they actually don't block office spaces. What they do is they add speed lines or speed bumps or the bot stops. Oakland and Chief Joshi may know this, right. They've added a lot of these raised starts to try to address it, but they still keep the spaces available. So can I ask, why hasn't staff done other things like that that allow the space to be used by law abiding citizens, many of which go to the Hornet and want to be able to park. You want to watch the sunset, things like that. But it sounds like, you know, what I'm hearing is that staff is jumping to let's just cut off areas, make them not accessible to cars. And maybe that is what we're trying to do here is have everyone on bikes and walking and we have fishermen that go out there and use the area. Some of these proposals would take that opportunity away. Yeah. Can I ask Chief Joshi if you'd like to address the you know, what is it? What is the problem we're trying to address here? Sir. Good evening and thank you, Madam Mayor, and good evening to the city council. So the concern these recommendations are to mitigate the gathering of cars that that then so those bot dots or the the rumble strips or, you know, things like that can actually they would they would deter people engaging in in, you know, doing the burnouts and things like that in those specific areas. However, when they when they do leave through the, you know, that entry chute, I guess you could call that it's been referenced in that way that that's where a lot of the burnout activity is also occurring. So I think that, you know, we can still have vehicles go down into that area, into those areas, and people can still enjoy the scenery there. And so, I mean, these I mean I mean, these are recommendations that we came up with for the council to provide direction on. So I put further clarifying questions. Councilmember Spencer. I appreciate your asking a question, but I've had a question. It's not the same question. For instance, the area of chief that you just brought up where the cars can enter, there are no speed bumps or speed lamps, anything like that. To slow traffic in that area is just a it's just a more narrow area. It's like a lane. Right. So my question was, why aren't we doing speed lamps or speed bumps to slow down traffic, for instance, in that area? It was like. Any of the any of the staff who's worked on this, too, would like to have been Andrew Thomas plan planning transportation. To a day. I think they probably both strategies work, right? We're trying to make the area unattractive for people to do inappropriate activities with their automobiles. So whether it's the Dot's all over the place or whether it's the barricade system, I will defer to our public works director, but my hunch is that the dot's to do it well and to do it as effectively as the barricades. There's just going to be a more expensive strategy to implement and to maintain. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Public Works Director Aaron Smith. Did you want to weigh in? I just wanted to add an additional thought. The bumps and there's both speed bumps and there's the dots that that folks are talking about. Those are definitely options. Where we went with just blocking off areas was really considering, you know, there's not a lot of travel. There's no travel lanes out here. It's just wide open space. And so this the intent here was to focus travel in one area and to focus it safely. That was the 40 foot lane that exists. If we just did the lumps or the bumps everywhere, then you just have that everywhere and there's still no identified travel lane and that presents and safety issues as well. There probably could be a way to create travel lanes with those bumps, but this is the approach that we took because it builds on what's existing with the 40 foot lane. Thank you. Katherine Harris. Spencer. Thank you. So I appreciate, you know, the safety plan. It sounded like from the chief's comments, though, that it's still not working, that, yes, there is an identified lane. So my question is why? Why aren't you considering adding maybe you are the speed bumps or bumps so that when the cars do funnel down that there is something that actually slows them down? I think that can definitely be an option within the 40 foot lane for sure. My understanding is another objective of what we're trying to do here is prevent the large scale congregation, not just the reckless driving that oftentimes happens at the tail end of these events, but a number of the events that I've been informed about and I've witnessed one, when I happen to be out there, it's the congregation. And so the bombs won't necessarily prevent the large scale congregation. So that was just another factor. But Councilmember Spence, you're absolutely right. In that 40 foot lane, we could certainly put in things that would if that became an issue of speed within that 40 foot lane, we could certainly put deterrents to reduce the speed within that. Okay. Further clarifying questions for you, Councilmember Herr Spencer. At this time. Okay. How about any other council members any any questions you want to ask of staff before we get to our public comments? Okay. I'm not seeing any hands up. So, Madam Clerk, how many speakers do we have? We have three speakers. Okay. So you want to explain what that means? Yes. So it means that we they all get 2 minutes unless we are 3 minutes, unless we get seven speakers, and then they would be lowered. And my thing is. Here we go. I can't find them. Okay, here. There. The case of the misplaced speakers. No, I can't. I can't see their names. It's really weird. And the first one is Laura. I have to maybe fini. Oh, okay. Laura. Well, yeah, I see her thing. Okay. Speaker fees are five. Go ahead. Welcome. Hello. Good evening. My name's Laura Fees. I'm executive officer at the U.S., a foreign art museum. So, first of all, thank you so much in this for differentiating between the various types of car events. That was really a very nice for me to hear and I could pass it along to everyone else on the crew. So from the museum's perspective, this kind of the car congregation is two fold. And the primarily, of course, is our general mission. You know, we'd really like to grow our general mission. We took a 90% revenue hit during COVID. So we are looking forward to getting that crowd back. And while generally the parking that we are leased is sufficient, ideally we'd like to sometimes, you know, peek into the what we referred to as the enterprise lot, which is a larger lot beyond us. And we already have that good coordination like assistant city manager was saying between us and the city to let them know when we have specific events that we are anticipating large numbers for and we can alert them that we are looking for more parking. But specifically also until the fantastic public public transportation options that have recently been introduced, Seaplane Lagoon and then Bus Line 78 are expanded to also cover the museum's hours of operation. And we will be depending on car traffic to bring attendance to the museum. Secondarily, I'd like to address the special events that we are looking forward to continue to hosting. We were allowed for events in our use permit, which I do hope we are able to keep because our museum, perhaps unsurprisingly, is particularly attractive to, I'll call them transportation enthusiasts, the planes, trains and automobiles types of people. So we've been having a great luck with kind of coordinating and city approved events where we are able to bring in car clubs who are generally well-behaved. I will not say perfectly, but I will say that specific car clubs that we have worked with officially have done things like reprimand and kick people out of their clubs for poor behavior. So I would hate to eliminate an entire car club on the bad behavior of one or two individuals who made poor choices during their visits. But yeah, I was just here in general to to advocate for the kind of differentiation on behalf of the museum, kind of consider those what is a, a good and safe and appropriate car club congregation, if you will. And then, of course, what is the dangerous stuff that we also don't want on the base? And we will do everything in our power to help eliminate that. And things like wheel stops and our parking lot would be lovely because we also don't want donuts and burnouts. So happy to talk to you more about it. It looks I'm just about to run out of time here, but thank you very much. Thank you for your comments. Our next speaker. Steve Shafer. Good evening, speaker. Maybe Shaffer. Schaffer. Schaffer It is. Okay. Yeah. I'm Steve Schafer. I'm the owner of Urban Legend Cellars in Building 25 or, as I've called it, ground zero for these events these days. First off, thank you very much to the assistant city manager, city manager, director Aaron Smith and to Chief Joshi and the council. I'm glad this is getting the attention it needs. The we really do need to do something here. If you look at option two, that entire area was full two weeks ago with a car show and a week before that. These shows have gotten very large, over 500 cars in attendance and well over 1000 people. You now have vendors coming out vending food. There appears to be a vendor coming out vending alcoholic beverages, which is completely illegal. The mess from the trash here and the sanitary mess that's leftover because there are no sanitary facilities out there are becoming a big problem. It is taking our customers 25 to 30 minutes to get into our site. We have been somewhat effective in being able to maintain a parking area for our customers, but we are at the last amount. We lost control of that. So if something needs to be done of the options that are out here, we prefer option two. It does not require vigilance as far as keeping a gate closed. It also provides a very nice public parking space out in one of the more scenic parts of the point. So I'm looking forward to seeing what action can be taken. And as always, I am here to do whatever I can to support this. Thank. Thank you. Thank you, Speaker Schafer. Were you were you finished? Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. I think we have at least one more speaker. Yes, one more speaker. Victor. Yay! Welcome back, Speaker to. Thank you so much. This has been incredibly insightful. Thank you to everyone on the city council. So I am a resident of Alameda landing on the West End. So this is all new to me. I've recently realized I think the last speaker said maybe two or three weekends of there's just been these car shows. And I think it's the one at the Monarch Street that assistant city manager Jerry was mentioning. So I actually first noticed when I was at home these last couple of Sundays, that there was just a hundreds of cars that were just coming down, Willie Stargell and Fifth Avenue around that area. And they were near hitting kids almost like it was one per hour. And they were, you know, it was just like really mind boggling to see because they didn't care just rushing their way through. And so I definitely am speaking up in terms of like neighborhood safety for the West End. They are to address, you know, councilmember harass. Spencer with regards to the bumps, I think they would help but I drove over to the actual area and it's like I testosterone felt like a lot. So it's not even about like they would just go over the bumps like fast like that actually were probably a fun thing to do, but they're, they're just like, vroom, vroom, vroom, the whole thing. And it's when they leave the site that that's where our neighborhood gets impacted and they're just coming through and speeding, doing kind of wheelies in the area. And it's just a train. Just see down that down Atlantic. All right. I think that's the street. So I definitely agree with the recommendations. And I'm looking but I also have some compassion for the Hornet museum in a sense of maybe there is a compromise. But I actually think it would be great to have a fence for the Hornet site and then also the maximum barriers possible to prevent congregation and allow the permitted shoulder to keep going, but these unauthorized ones to be deterred. So thank you so much for your time. Thank you for your comments. Any further speakers, Madam Clerk? No, there are no more speakers. With that, I'm going to close public comment on this item and we'll go back to the council. And I guess I have a clarifying question. I thought that I wish I'd asked earlier, but I'll ask it of Chief Joshi. Now, if I could, can you just explain to us the challenges that your officers and I think you've actually been out at Alameda Point on some of these weekend days when there's been problematic auto activity. Can you just describe for us what you and your officers experience and how you control that? Sure. So a couple of things. I think that the previous speaker, just this last speaker that came on, really emphasized a point that are brought up, a point that I'd like to emphasize when you have the sheer numbers. You have so many hundreds and hundreds. In fact, I think it was in one of these events, as reported, somewhere around 600 vehicles that were out there. It's hard to get. There are no lanes. There's no way to get. You know, for example, if you need to get an ambulance down there, you need to get some type of medical attention to to someone that was down there. It's difficult to do that. And then the other thing is that the side sideshow, the whole mindset with these sideshows that you want to draw a large enough group, a large enough audience to to then do these sideshow, these stunts, the reckless driving and things like that. So when you have a bunch of participants that are there, that's what kind of fuels the activity. And so as they are leaving the site, that's when a lot of the reckless driving will occur. So I think it's it's by having an approach that addresses and minimizes the numbers, we're able to one, most importantly, be in a position to provide some type of public safety if there's a need for an emergent an emergency response. We can do that when the numbers aren't so thick. And then the other thing is that people are not they don't have a huge audience, a large audience, where they can engage in the reckless driving as they're leaving out from a paved park. Thank you. Okay. Council members. We've heard from one of you. And that's why you have your hand up. I saw that. But I thought. Huh? I was so serious. See where you get that? Oh, did you. You bagged the reason? I guess so. Thank you. I just want to thank staff for all the work on this. I know it's a complicated effort for me. You know, I have approached this since we decided to open this as from from the position that debate park is. We are going to spend millions of dollars to turn and turn this into a park where you can't walk, where you can't drive. And the only way to access is walking and biking. And I don't personally see any reason why, just because it's currently paved and not paved, that we need to encourage people to drive to the end there. I'm glad to see that a you know, a number of our the supporters of the future D Pave Park are now supporting the idea of turning this into a place so that it's a little bit more family and community oriented with walking and biking. You know, I was very saddened to learn about kind of the impact of some of. Activities that have been happening near Building 25 and the wineries out there. That was actually a bob of all the negative impacts. That was not one that was on my radar until very, very recently. So I would be very supportive of choosing option one. No, option two, if that's where we want to go. I don't understand why we would be creating yet another very long driveway for people to race up and down and go to the parking lot and whatnot. I fully support the fence over by the Hornet. I think we started this conversation with everybody, you know, pointing pointing fingers at the Hornet. And it turned out that it really wasn't the Hornet, but it was people using that space. And I think if we closed down be paved park, we're going to find a lot of folks heading back over to that large section of cement. And, you know, beyond the fact that these sideshows have become a real problem out there. Again, this the back end during the sideshows where the problem was the behavior of the all the people coming and going, racing through our neighborhoods. And we can as as presenters have mentioned, we can stop some of the sideshow like behavior within one of our lots, maybe using dots and curbs and whatever else. But at the same time, we're still going to be getting the calls from our neighbors who are unhappy with people doing 40, 50 miles an hour down in the Pacific and and through our neighborhoods. And so I think we can work. Personally, I would be more than happy to continue to work with the Hornet to figure out a way to support meaningful events that may have a have an auto focus as long as it also has some focus to what they need to do to the business of the Hornet as well, whether that's classic cars, etc., not just souped up cars that are that are that are racing their engines and causing problems out of the at the point. And with that, I will I will yield the rest of my time. Thank you, councilman rex. Wait. I think I saw cycles what councilmember de folks hand up. No, it didn't. Okay. Councilmember, her response. I think I saw your hand up. Did I? Yes. Thank you, Mayor. So I have a question is when the paper comes along, is dash sellers going to be still there? Building 25 going to be there. Kathleen, the. Message you want to answer that or. The current master infrastructure from the point now's the perimeter levee that saves building 25 building 25 is inland of the perimeter levee so. It is intended to be protected from sea level rise and not be part of deep far. Thank you. And then the area that's already cordoned off by the train did take part or I'm sorry, dash sellers. And I think the tower there, there's a big area that has already been blocked off. Is that going to be the park or is that still going to go? That's intended. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Councilmember Spencer. I just got excited to answer it is our the master infrastructure plan has it as a large stormwater detention basin kind of similar to what was put in like Bayport where it'll collect stormwater flow before it discharges. Thank you. Okay, so I've submitted some pictures and I don't know if the clerk was able to show some of my pictures because I want to answer some of the questions about what do people do out there that are law abiding citizens like myself? I go out there all the time. I pick up food, many of us social distance. Then we park, we congregate somewhere. I guess maybe the term is congregate, but I actually don't think that's illegal to congregate. So this is actually something I think staff has added these cement logs almost and quite often they are filled with skateboarders and they actually bring out cars and they film each other. There's nothing illegal as far as I know. With that, I think it's a great place to have young adults and youth families congregate there and they use these. And some of you may have gone out there and seen seen where this is, but it's towards the end. And as I'm looking at the drawings correctly, this will be not this area will no longer be accessible to the public. Are these going to stay for the skateboarders to use? Are they going to be removed or not accessible? Option two, the intent was to not remove those. So that would remain. And the reason why option two was presented was to allow for this just for those that aren't from this building 29 saw at the very end there are. Law abiding citizens that access the shoreline very regularly for fishing or for skateboarding or for however that whatever they're doing out there an option to actually keep this open. And this would be part of the space that's exterior to the barriers. So I appreciate that. And we can just imagine honestly, quite often it could be, I'm going to guess 50 young adult teenagers playing on this with their skateboards. I think that's a healthy activity. And, you know, it's like a playground for them that is, you know, more age appropriate. Okay. Next picture, please. Okay. And so I was out there this evening and you have your cars that come out and then the people stand there and they push and that's the ride along the bay. And that's an amazing view. And one of the this could also maybe start, if you could help me again, is this option too that would allow the cars to come out and fish people the fish. Yeah. This was this picture exactly. Was the to preserve this was the objective of option to keep this area accessible for vehicles. And I'm not sure how wide the point is. You know, at the end there, the staff is leaving, how much space. But you can see and quite often on weekends this will have multiple cars, it will add canopies so that they have shade because they're close to no trees and they'll have families come out, get a couple of cars together, put a canopy over it and put their chairs in there and sit there and enjoy the shoreline. Okay. So the next picture. Okay. So this is also from this evening, you can see the cars go all the way to the fence and that actually was starting to be sunset. So that's what they're seeing and why they go out there. Some of them are fishing, some are just enjoying the bay. And, you know, they're law abiding people. You're not doing anything wrong. Next picture. Okay. And here's another group that was from this past weekend. You know, they bring their chairs, they sit out there, they fish and enjoy the bay. So I would like us to be able to come up. I personally and I think that could be the the last picture. I guess I should check with staff to make sure that's the last one. Thank you. And so I. I want to speak for the law abiding citizens that hang out there and enjoy the bay. And I do know at some point that we won't have as much access via cars, which I support D.P. Park. But I feel like in the meantime, we should be able to have access via cars. And I personally, you know, I'm one of those people that had a terrible bicycle accident. This is a very long area to walk. And if you're going to be carrying your chairs, bringing your fishing equipment, people of all ages, I hope, you know, I would like us to come up with a way to allow, as law abiding citizens that like to congregate and not break any laws, but enjoy and during COVID. I do it almost every weekend, if not multiple times, because I pick up food to go. I get my chairs and you're going to see cars scattered the length along the water, socially distance. Right. So we're not on top of each other. So personally, I think the area is insufficient. I'd like to see the area so the cars could almost do like a new block out and fine blocking out more of the middle if that would help. But I would also like us to consider more of the speed bumps, just, you know, to honesty in regards to do you do donuts over speed lumps and bumps? I'm going to disagree. I actually think that I think that those work and deter and slow down. And I have seen car shows, if you will, not there. I've actually seen it down one of the other streets. That is long. And the issue goes across our city. We're really not going to be closing off all the streets. I need a staff that can help figure out how do we address the criminal behavior and support people like myself and these people that are efficient and people of all ages so that they can enjoy the bay . And I think that may be the U-shape where the cars can pull up and still be along the water. For me, I think that could be a better solution instead of just saying, no, we can't, we can't do that. And I do support that. The Hornet also, I do want to work with them and the fencing and whatnot to try to accommodate the shows. They can have a lot of people. We all know the biggest event out there is the antique fair and they'll have like 10,000 cars. They can have a lot of cars. So this is not just the deep part. And I also think we should put trash cans out there. Think about putting trash cans out there. There are no trash cans. And even consider like one of the speakers said, the bathroom facilities, we don't have any out there. We've added them to other places in our community. Maybe we could do that too. But I am concerned about I'm going to call overreach. I'm really not addressing the problem. There are, I think like even that lane cars can go fast there. And to me, if the issue is to slow down cars, that's different than cordoning off big areas and not allowing people to have access. Thank you. Thank you. I would just like some clarification. I think, Mr. Smith, maybe when the staff report to to Councilmember Herb Spencer's point and desire for people to be able to enjoy that area of the shoreline that was shown in the photos under the barrier. Option two. Am I understanding this correctly that it. Would. So it would provide vehicle access and parking for building 25 customers that are wineries but and allow vehicle access to the southernmost shoreline. Wasn't that the southernmost shoreline we were looking at in the photos? That's correct. And it it would continue to allow vehicle access to the southern portion, not the full length of the eastern portion. So just the southern portion. Okay. Thank you. All right. Who would like to go next? Kalahari Desert. Go ahead. Thank you. Just a quick comment. You know, four West Enders traumatized by sideshows and reckless driving. I think the message is pretty clear that help is on the way. And so I certainly support the recommendation from staff. All of the recommendation from staff. I do think, though, that what council member Harris Spencer is raising about putting some some kind of speed lamps, especially around the that that that the length of option to use that road that might slow down if there's going to be speeding, you know, down that road, maybe speed lamps outside of the outside of the West Haunted Avenue area as well. But but I certainly appreciate what staff has put together. I think it's going to go a long way in addressing the underlying causes. As to why there's just so much reckless driving is because there's these big areas where people are able to hold, you know, these kinds of massive sideshows. But I think the options that you have laid out here is addressing that. So I certainly appreciate that. I also want to convey my appreciation to Councilmember Knox White and mayor as the crafting bringing this forward as a council agenda item. You're welcome. Thank you. Vice mayor of L.A.. I appreciate the presentation by staff. I think getting the visuals really helps in terms of having this conversation. You know, I was out there today and kind of trying to to kind of better orient myself with some of the spaces that were that were listed in terms of the options. I do want to be I do want to be careful in that we can still preserve the bike and pedestrian access. But I do think that more needs to be done to limit vehicle access. We do have a number of spaces that are still left completely open. I don't necessarily think putting any additional speed bumps and things like that are going to be helpful. I think we can add certain things in or along the way, but if we're not going to block off these larger spaces, we're still going to have problems out there, which are the sideshows and the larger gatherings. So I. You know, I do support option two, I think and I think that there's that that'll offer, you know, some some more protections for us. And I just want to thank staff for their work on this. And, you know, I know that we get lots of calls from folks about, you know, events and things like that occurring out there. And I you know, I think our police officers are doing what they can to enforce. It's also very difficult, as our chief mentioned, to be at all places, at all times. And so I think taking into account these mitigation efforts through design and things like that will really make a difference. I think they have started to make a difference as well. Thank you. Vice Premier So so I'll go last and the I and I did was one of the the conveners of this council referral that underlies the staff report. And I think all of the staff lots of you were involved. Thank you for bringing all this good information forward. So what I've asked myself is what are the advantages and disadvantages of auto oriented events? At Alameda point to the city it was mentioned that there is the once the month for is a month antiques by the bay fair that takes place the people who come there, both the vendors who pay their fees to be there and the buyers who buy goods there are contributing to the city because they're paying sales tax for what the sales tax on the items and then the permit fees and whatnot that the the organizer of of that space collects. And and it is once a month and it does have an impact on the traffic. Sometimes it coincides with these spontaneous advertised on social media non sanctioned events and that can really create havoc on getting in and out of the island and on just the safety. As our Western resident who spoke and was one of many Western residents that I would hear from after every weekend about just the terror they felt about not being able to safely cross the street, ride their bikes with their families in bike lanes on our streets because of this reckless driving and weaving in and out and just disregard for for the the public safety of our residents and our visitors. And so when we're talking about these gatherings of autos, for the most part, they're just gatherings of autos. Somebody may be setting up as a vendor selling food and drink, which I think is probably illegal and unpermitted, but they're not paying any revenue back to the city. But what they're leaving behind, and we heard it described is the litter is, the human waste is and then all of the particulate matter that all of these cars are spewing into the atmosphere at a time when we as an island are struggling to get greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change and sea level rise under control. So I don't see and the other disadvantages are that increased traffic, the speeding that impacts public safety, as I mentioned, risks to pedestrians, bicyclists and and then there's the interference with the businesses that are out there. And we have heard from the owners of urban legends of Dash Cellars that they're I mean, after all they went through with the pandemic and having to close down and now their visitors sometimes can't even get to them when things are open again. So and as far as the Hornet, you know, I've been to many events on the Hornet. I had the honor of presiding over a naturalization ceremony for 50 new citizens just before the 4th of July this year. I've gone out on the flight deck. It was wonderful. There's a lot of history throughout that vessel, but I really struggle to see the connection to the USS Hornet, this World War Two era ship aircraft carrier, with permitting auto related events of up to 1000 autos at the Hornet Museum. I don't see the connection, and I also think it's sending the wrong message that to the greater public in the Bay Area that, oh, this Alameda point out there, that's a great place for lots of wide open space. Come on out. And you can just do all kinds of things because it's it's pretty much the Wild West. They just, you know, it's it's you can do what you want. And that's the sort of message we're sending. I want to support the Hornet. I think there's ways we can do it, but I don't want to do it with allowing them to have events with up to 1000 autos, because those autos are coming down our city streets and sometimes driving too fast and just causing the traffic for our residents and any way I want to . So what I would like to do is we can work to help the Hornet Museum. It's you know, it should be able to be marketed in a lot of different ways, but not as a car venue. So. I am very much supportive of what staff has recommended the both the restricting or eliminating use permits. I would eliminate them authorizing large scale automobile oriented events and to minimize noise, speeding and emission risks associated with these advance implement barrier. Option two that sounds reasonable to me. And also implement the West Hornet fence option, but also to work with the Hornet Museum when they're having events on the Hornet to make sure that they're there . Visitors have good places, options for parking. So I and I guess the fourth one is to leave the wheel stops that were placed where they are. But I think that it's time to listen to our residents and to our businesses out there who are being impacted. I think that we still have options for people who want to enjoy the shoreline, but we can do it in a safe in much more environmentally friendly manner. So is anyone ready to make a motion? Councilmember decide? Yes. I'd like to move. Staff's recommendation. The one addition that I'd like to ask, and I don't think it's a substantive addition, but that staff as this as a situation warrants consider a speed bumps along that one path as the situation warrants the one path towards you know, the areas where Councilmember Harris Spencer took pictures. So and I'm not requiring it. I'm just saying that as the situation warrants. So but other than that, a moving staff recommendation. Okay, Councilman Ashley. Thank you, Councilmember. Not sorry. I think I saw your hand go to. Well, I will second that the motion ma'am asked for a clarification from councilmember decide which is a recommendation everyone says restrict or eliminate use use permits authorizing large scale automobile or car events. I would be very okay with eliminating use permits with the exception of maintaining the historic the existing contract we have with the Hornet. But that allows them to maintain certain of a certain number of events. Okay. So Councilmember. That's right. Are you okay with. With that addition. Yeah. I want everyone to find out. Councilmember Desai. I meant Cosmo Design. Did I say dockside? I'm okay. We had a discussion. Just. Just as long as I can ask this clarifying question. That wouldn't affect antiques by the bay, though. That. Correct. Okay. All right. I just. Yeah. Okay, good. Okay. To both the maker and second of the motion, I have a request. I personally think that a permit that allows up to 1000 vehicles is too many, and I would want to see that number reduced. That sounds fair. I refuse to let. Councilmember Knox wait. You know, I mean, we haven't actually seen that that the Hornets issue is the issue is the issue. And I just I do worry that we we will continue to bump up against this issue with the Hornets, where they are constantly looking for ways to keep themselves solid. And so this isn't where the problem's coming from. I personally, I would rather just kind of address that if it becomes an issue in the future where we're taking some pretty major steps as it is. I mean, I know if that's the only way to get the three votes, the ninth, and yeah, I would be happy to . For me, I don't I don't see the need to limit that. If staff is working with the Hornets to improve appropriate order we're in, it shows that they're somatic and not, you know, just sideshows. You know, I. Okay. I will just add that I think the impact of a thousand vehicles, even if they're not sideshows, is significant. Councilor Everyday said you had your hand up. I just wanted to get staff's comments or observations on mayor as he Ashcraft thoughts. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. You know, I just I just. Thought it'd be helpful to clarify the current use permit for the U.S.. HORN It allows up to four car oriented events per year and limits those to 75 military and or antique cars 50 years or older. Oh. Okay. Where do they get the. Now what? They have to get special event permits for events where they think a thousand people or more might be attending. So the way they work, the way they use permit is set up for the Hornet, is that we we treat them as a museum and an event space. So basically, if you're having events, you can have events. If you think you're having more than a thousand people show up, then we need you to apply for a special event permit just so we can warn police and public works and everyone else. And then we put this additional limitation. If that special event is for a car show, you can only have four of them and you can. It has to be limited to those criteria I mentioned. Thank you for that clarification. I did not pick that up from the staff report. I just thought there's, you know, for more than 1000, it would require special events. Okay. I'm okay then with book promotion, the second is okay. All right. Thank you. We've had a motion. We've had a second councilmember Herb Spencer. I saw your hand up. Thank you, Mayor. I was going to ask for clarification, but I will not be supporting this. I think it's unfortunate that we're being I think doing overreach and not doing more what other cities are doing to actually slow down the problem. And I want to make it really clear we have a right to park our car and talk to other people. I'm very concerned about trying to eliminate what has been referred to as congregating. And I'm going to add that many times. It is people of color that come to these. Places, too. And honestly, they're not they're talking to each other and whatnot. So I think it's unfortunate. Thank you. I can't help it. So is it just a clear clarification? My understanding of option two is that people can still drive down the road to the tail end where where Councilmember Harris took pictures and fish. That's my understanding of option do. Nick Smith Director Smith. That's correct. And I did want to clarify, when I used the term congregate, I was talking about the large number of vehicles, not the access of the shoreline by individuals, but the large unpermitted events was when I used the term congregate. Okay. Thank you. Cause we're not quite. Sorry. And just for. For folks. What? I mean, you know, there is no prohibition against competition, and we have 840 acres of places people can park their cars next to each other, congregate, communicate, etc.. We're just trying to address some large areas that have attracted huge and illegal sideshows that have caused significant problems. But I don't want people to walk away thinking that we're somehow keeping people from parking, driving at this point or whatever else. Thank you for that clarification to. All right. We have a motion. We have a second. Any further discussion since then? Madam Clerk, may we have a roll call vote, please? It's interpretation. By. Her, Spencer. No, not quite. Avella by Mayor Ashcraft, I That carries 4 to 1. All right. Thank you, counsel, for all your valuable input and thank you so much to staff all of you for the work that went into putting this together. And I know our residents and especially our Western residents are grateful. So thank you so much. Okay. With that, we wrap up item seven B and we move on to item seven C, Madam Clerk.","Recommendation to Provide Direction to Staff to Pursue One or More Options for Reducing the Negative Impacts and Public Safety Challenges Associated with Automobile-Oriented Events at Alameda Point.

AN ORDINANCE authorizing the City Manager to execute a property exchange agreement with King County, transferring jurisdiction of certain city parcels to King County in exchange for other parcels; ratifying and confirming prior acts. Council referral emphasized reducing negative impacts and safety challenges at Alameda Point associated with auto-oriented events. Staff presented options to balance managing events with safety concerns, including scaling back permits, implementing physical barriers, and enhancing police presence. Recommendations aimed to allow enjoyment of the area while mitigating negative impacts. Staff elevated the item as a priority following a council referral, identifying three types of events at Alameda Point and proposing actions to address reckless driving and gatherings. The staff recommendation sought to remove large-scale auto events, retain barriers, and implement fencing options to restrict vehicle access. Various options were discussed, including barrier placements and potential municipal code amendments to address illegal activities. Public speakers highlighted concerns and proposed tailored solutions for maintaining safe public access while addressing disruptive behaviors at Alameda Point. The council members deliberated on restricting use permits for large-scale auto events, implementing physical barriers, and collaborating with the USS Hornet Museum. A motion was approved to support staff recommendations, including preserving access for law-abiding citizens, monitoring events, and enhancing safety measures while addressing concerns around auto-oriented activities at Alameda Point. Councilmember Herb Spencer expressed opposition based on concerns about limiting public access and congregating opportunities for residents, particularly those of color. The council clarified that option two maintains access for law-abiding citizens to the southern shoreline while addressing safety concerns and managing disruptive auto events at Alameda Point. The ordinance passed with a 4-1 vote.

The public hearing for counsel bill 1022 is open. May we have the staff report the results at all. Good evening, Theresa and Sarah with community planning and development. This is a map amendment for property at 2001 through 25 East 18th Avenue. It is located in City Council District nine in the City Park West neighborhood. And at the nine five. No, I'm just. I'm sorry. Did I just. I messed up. Keep going. All right. At the northeast corner of 18th Avenue and Ray Street, a block southeast of the Presbyterian St Luke's Medical Center, and four blocks east of Saint Joseph's Hospital, three blocks west of City Park. Property is 6250 square feet. It is a vacant duplex structure that is being renovated. A property owner is just modernizing the commercial uses allowed on the property to be in line with the adjacent properties. Again, the request is to rezone from a chapter 59 pad number 107 to General Urban Multi-unit. I'm sorry, mixed use three stories. So it is in the general urban neighborhood. That's right to my notes characterized by single unit two unit multi-unit residential with a in a variety of building forms, low scale commercial embedded in residential areas. So. Sort of your typical old Denver neighborhood. Existing context. Again, the zoning is that Chapter 59 PD. There is a view plane from City Park and the Natural History Museum that governs that governs the height on the property. And the allowed height is 73 feet. The property again is a vacant duplex that's being renovated. So the number 107 was adopted in 1985. It allows the old chapter 59 are for land uses, and that was their residential office that had some limited retail. And so north of the property is a general urban residential office. Three story east, north and south east is the x three, same as the proposed, and then west is a medical office building that's zoned campus h two, which is among the campus zone districts, is a transitional zone district. So again, sublet properties vacant adjacent uses. Multi-family commercial civic with the hospitals, a very healthy mix of uses in this area, the property you can sort of see behind the trees. But I just wanted to give you an idea of the height of the surrounding structures and kind of the variety of uses in the area, the property itself. You can see at the top of this slide, I'm on slide 11, just let's see, I can get my directions mixed up behind the property. Is the buildings on the upper right directly adjacent to the properties on 18th Avenue is the picture on the bottom. Right across 18th Avenue is the multi-unit condominium building and then a medical building across directly across race street on the upper left, all about well up to three stories or more. So informational notice on this went out in July, a notice of a complete application planning board hearing on September 6th, and the board unanimously voted to recommend approval of this. There was one person who testified who was the neighbor adjacent behind who really was there just to find out information about the rezoning. And then this was at the Land Use Committee on October 3rd and passed through committee. So we're here tonight for the public hearing. There are a number of registered neighborhood organizations in the area, but today we have no public comment on this application. So the plans that apply are Plan 2000, Blueprint Denver and a 1986 Uptown Neighborhood Plan, which I have to state was a very pleasant plan to work with. Its its recommendations seem to still hold up. So plan to 2000 tells us to encourage quality infill development to promote mixed use development, to encourage positive change and diversity while protecting our traditional character of our neighborhoods. To identify areas where increased density and new uses are desirable and can be accommodated, and to support retention of our businesses in the city. Blueprint Denver The land use concept is single family residential. Those are areas which are predominantly residential but which do have a smaller employment base generally embedded in the neighborhoods. And it is in an area of stability where of course we want to preserve our neighborhood character but also allow some reinvestment in our neighborhoods. Future Street classification for East 18th Avenue is a mixed use arterial. These are the types of streets that have a high degree of mobility, and a mixed use are generally located in our higher intensity mixed use areas, commercial areas and mixed well commercial and residential areas. Ray Street is an undesignated local street. The property is also within the quarter mile buffer of an enhanced transit corridor, which is York Street. And so those are areas where we want to have supportive land uses and policies for to support transit. The Uptown Neighborhood Plan, like I said, was adopted in 1986. It that plan vision is for an urban village to have distinct districts that are distinct in their building densities and mixture of land uses that is distinct from downtown, that is livable and economically vital. General plan recommendations are to reinforce the distinct districts in the area, to reinforce the distinctions between the districts, to encourage mixed use projects and to encourage housing. The district that the plan that this property is in is in the City Park West District. On the district map in the plan, those recommendations are to encourage housing, to encourage compatibility between new development and the existing residential and the well residential character of the District 4/18 Avenue to improve the pedestrian character and have hospital support and destination retail on East 18th Avenue and then retail recommendations to concentrate the retail uses on the east west streets particularly. Well, 18th Avenue was specifically named there and that the retail uses should be concentrated around. Some of the present retail development. So with that, staff believes that this application is conforming to our plans, that we are furthering the uniformity of district regulations by. Using our standard zone districts versus our custom zone districts, and that we're furthering the public health, health, safety and welfare by allowing this reinvestment in the property, by implementing our plans. Justifying circumstances are changed conditions. There are a number of new developments in the area, starting with the hospital redevelopment and a lot of new townhomes and condos in the area. So staff believes this is an appropriate changed conditions. And we did talk a little bit about the character of the general urban neighborhood context, multi-unit, single unit, residential in a variety of building forms, low scale commercial embedded within the residential areas, residential uses along local streets, but some commercial located along mixed use arterials such as 18th Avenue and then the Jim X three specific intent to promote safe, active pedestrian areas and to enhance the convenience and enjoyment of transit, walking and shopping and. That's about it. So with that, staff recommends approval. All right. Thank you, Mr. Sarah. We have two speakers this evening. We when I call your name, just come to the front bitch and I will start now. Adrian Weatherby and Alison Altair is. Out there is this study. Come sit down here. Mr. Wetherbee, your first 3 minutes. Thank you. First of all, for your public service. Thank you for supporting all of the issues that the first time bore witness to this evening. I was impressed. And I owe you that, I think. Thank you. My name is Adrian Weatherby. I work for a small architectural firm in northwest Denver. Our address is 3628 West 32nd Avenue. I am here representing this rezoning application. I wanted to thank Teresa as well. And Eugene, thank you for your work. The Planning Commission and the city staff again for the work on this application. As Teresa mentioned, the purpose of the application was remove restrictive code and allow a more modern set of commercial uses on the property. The property owner does not have any current plans to demolish the existing structure. The current plan is to renovate the first four units for commercial use and a second floor for apartments. We're looking forward to rehabbing the existing building, getting tenants in and making it a contributing member of the neighborhood. In terms of community outreach. We met with Capitol Hill United Neighbors several months back and took comments from them. We've reached out several times since then, and our understanding is that the neighborhood organizations are relatively neutral on this application. I'm happy for myself and our attorney, Allison L Terrace, to answer any questions the council members may have otherwise. We respectfully request your approval of this application. Miss others. Good evening, members of Council. Thank you for your time tonight. My name is Allison Altares. I'm counsel for the property owner and I'm only here to answer questions if you have any of my addresses. 319 Eudora Street. Great. All right, thank you. This concludes a comment portion. Any questions by members of council? I have one quick question. Is the owner of the property actually here? Out here? Okay. So so you guys are representing the owners. We had a conversation in committee around possible uses and obviously this is part of a food desert. We talked about, you know, grocery store. It uses things like that. Has that been talked about with the owner? Things like that? I think we mentioned that in kind of a summary of of meetings that we had previously to the owner. It was a very favorable meeting, we thought, and relayed some of those kind of ideas. I still think he's an undetermined at the moment as to what he might do other than restore it initially on the upper level for tenancy renters and some sort of commercial use on the lower level, although. So he will be using retail. We know that at the lower level, but he hasn't decided what what retail tenants would be in there. Okay, Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. Just a quick question for Teresa since hopefully you deep dived into that that uptown village. The small lot parking or. No. Normally that that's what I ask everybody that loonie. Yeah please don't bring that up. Yeah. There was a lot of forward thinking comments that you referenced here on that, you know, 31 year old plan. Mm hmm. You know, so hopefully, you know, these are things that we continue to sort of talk about debate. And now it's part of Denver. Right. I'm just curious because there are always some dated components. Did it talk about parking in this area and what did it speak to? Well, at the time the plan was written, there were multiple parking lots. I mean, the neighborhood was just a lot of parking lots. And in talked spoke very negatively about being parking lots for downtown. So I'd be it would be even it'd be fun. And maybe I'll busted out to see all the forward looking comments that are that are that resonate that you that you quoted, that resonate with a lot of our plans today. But it'd be interesting to see that because they were so impacted by all those surface laws that if they were actually language towards away from parking, that too would also be consistent with movements you see towards. Today, towards redevelopment. Yeah. So yeah, I've got my questions answered on the small committee, so thank you. Good. I'm glad yours were answer because mine weren't. All right. Thank you, Councilman. Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Seeing no other questions by members of comment, public hearing is is now closed. Comments by members of council. Any comments by members of council? All right. CNN's Madam Secretary, recall. Black eye. Clark. Right. Espinosa. Flynn. I. Gilmore. I turned in Cashman. Kenny Ortega. Mr. President. I.

The committee recommends the bill passes amended. Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you, sir. This this legislation is in and related to a CSO project in Ballater, a combined sewer overflow. The in this area of Ballard, there's a combined sewer system, which means that the stormwater runs into the sewer system. What that results in is in heavy rain events. It can overwhelm the sewer system, at least temporarily. The solution to this, and we're in our consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency to deliver this in the next, I believe ten years is a combination of green stormwater infrastructure. So how we develop on the streets to capture that water and treat it naturally and also storage facilities. This specifically is a storage facility, the shape of the storage facility. This tank is essentially a tunnel that runs from Balad to Wallingford and it'll hold water and major rain events and delay the delivery to the sewer system until the sewer system has time to treat it. The majority of this tunnel is built under public right away, but there are a couple of parcels where a couple private properties that are affected by this.

So we continue to be basis on that original agreement, back when sound transit first started in the region and continue to add sections as it continue to add sections to the light, rail, spine and corridor. We continue to update that agreement. This is one of the places that we discussed a lot in the work this council did, along with sound transit board members and others throughout the region, leading to Sound Transit, putting the Sound Transit three ballot measure forward and that set of projects. There was a lot of talk, as you may recall, about what are the things that we can do as a city and other jurisdictions can do to coordinate better, streamline the process to both reduce costs for expanding light rail and perhaps more importantly, reduce the time line it takes to deliver it. I believe this memorandum of understanding reflects the ongoing, strong relationship that Seattle Department of Transportation has built with sound transit, things like how we work together on utility corridors, whether it's Seattle City, later Seattle Public Utility or right away that Seattle Department of Transportation owns or other ways the city interacts with light rail authority are important. And I also think it's something that we will continue to build upon and improve if voters do pass that on transit three this fall to allow us to continue to streamline that process so that we can get light rail in our communities as soon as possible.

From Starbucks to Amazon and soon enough, Apple, we may be seeing the most significant moment in the country's labor movement where the pandemic is not only shifting the future of work, but workers are building collective power for a unified voice and better workplace conditions. 16 Starbucks stores in Massachusetts have filed to unionize, including seven right here in Boston, three in Allston, Brighton and the rest in the Longwood Back Bay downtown and the South End. Two weeks ago, the stores at 13 of four Commerce in Allston and Coolidge Corner in Brookline, voted unanimously to become the first two Starbucks to unionize in Massachusetts. And next Tuesday, May 3rd in the and in the election vote count for three more stores in Allston, Brighton and in Longwood. While the concentration of Starbucks stores organizing in my district, my office has has been repeatedly contacted by regional corporate representatives. However, like many across the country, Starbucks workers have reported to my office the aggressive union busting tactics, including a captive audience, and want 1 to 1 meetings with misrepresented misinformation, as well as increased surveillance and corporate personnel traveling in from outside the region to put pressure on staff not to unionize. I want to acknowledge and extend my support to the staff, to the Starbucks partners and union organizers who are in the chamber with us today. Thank you so much. And I urge my colleagues to join me in adopting this resolution to support the Greater Boston Starbucks Workers United and call on the company to drop their union busting and election interference. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. The chair recognizes Councilor Flynn. Thank you. Thank you, Councilor Edwards. Thank you, Councilor Edwards, and thank you. Council president for allowing me to join and join you on this important matter. This body has a long history of supporting the rights of working men and women across greater Boston, across our our state as well. I have two Starbucks in my district, one in the South End and one in downtown Boston that are going to prepare for hopefully to become part of the union. Councilor Braden highlighted some of the strong tactics management is using to discourage workers from joining a union. Boston has always had a Boston has always been a proud union and Labor City. And we stand here with the workers because these workers are our neighbors, our family through our Little League coach. They might not be they might not be known to us today, but it's important that their voices are heard. More of these restaurants and more of these shops are opening up Starbucks across the city. But it's important that they have an opportunity to earn a decent wage, to have some health care, to have dignity and retirement, and to be treated fairly and treated with respect. So I just want to say thank you to my colleague Council Braden, for allowing me to join her. But I also want to thank my colleagues here in the city council that have long supported the rights of workers to organize here across the city and really across the country as well. Thank you. The chair recognizes cancer, but. I think we all know that the reality of unionization in America is a two track story in which we have a few industries and the public sector in which there's still some strength in unionization. And then just a lot of private industries where we see a dramatic decline. And the only way we're going to turn that around is if we get unionization of the really large corporate conglomerates across the country, especially in the service industry. And so I just think that it is I mean, the two most important things going on for like actually having people power rather than corporate power run the country are probably the Starbucks and Amazon unionization drives that are happening right now. And it's incumbent upon all of us to support those efforts wherever they hit in our patch here in the city of Boston. And so I'm strongly in support of the Starbucks workers who are attempting to unionize in my district, District eight, and will be of of any who come forward and would be of Dunkin Donuts workers or any other large industry where workers want to say, hey, we've had enough and we really need a seat at the table and and good, strong, equitable working conditions. So. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you. Does anyone else wish to speak on the matter? Does anyone wish to add their name?

To receive this Ellen source, Diane Lichtenstein and Laura Thomas. You could approach the podium and now read this proclamation. Whereas quality, affordable housing is vital to building healthy, safe, vibrant and diverse communities. And. Whereas, affordable homes are the solution to homelessness and provide support to seniors, families, youth, veterans, and people with disabilities. And. Whereas, rising housing costs have led longtime residents to be displaced, live in overcrowded and substandard homes, or become homeless, threatening our region's diversity and economic prosperity, and first, creating new permanent, affordable homes. And preserving and improving existing rental housing helps our residents maintain community roots and encourages social and economic diversity for generations. And. WHEREAS, development of affordable homes close to public transit and jobs can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide low income families better access to opportunities and amenities. And. Whereas, empowering residents living in affordable housing as advocates helps to shape better housing, tenant protections and development policies. And. Whereas, nonprofit organizations, local jurisdictions, community organizations and many others continue to build inclusive communities by providing shelter, homes and support for low income people and those with special needs. And. Whereas, East Bay housing organizations has organized affordable housing week for 19 years and will feature 21 events acknowledging the need for and contributions of affordable housing. Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, Treasurer Spencer, Mayor of the City of Alameda, do hereby proclaim May eight through 17th, 2015 as the 19th Annual Affordable Housing Week in the city of Alameda. If further resolved that the City of Alameda will work to support affordable housing at the local, regional and state level and will encourage residents of the City of Alameda to participate in affordable housing week activities. Thank you. And feel free to say a few words. Okay. Hopefully we'll just be a few. We also have Neill Saxby from Eden Housing. So there will be three of us speaking. I think he was originally scheduled to accept the proclamation along with us. Thank you. Laura Thomas renewed hope housing advocates. I'm here on behalf of Renewed Hope and also as a member of East Bay housing organizations. And as you may know, since Alameda is a member of EB HOA, that it is an organization with 400 members, individuals and organizations devoted to creating affordable housing. Through advocacy. Advocacy, education and coalition building. Thank you for recognizing affordable housing week two years ago, Renewed Hope was honored during this very same week by EB HOA for our years of advocacy work and for pushing, which included pushing for the passage of the city's housing element, which of course brought Alameda into compliance with state law. But the really important fact was that what really the idea that Alameda finally embraced the idea that we needed to build housing for everybody, not just for the, you know, the top 11% who can actually afford a market rate home. I think that symbolized Alameda is Elam's acceptance of that concept. And that was really the important thing that. Happened with with our work. And in 2013. The theme for Affordable Housing Week, as you as this was stated, is here to stay building inclusive communities. It addresses the urgency of the current moment in the Bay Area, not just in Alameda, of course, where we see people with roots who belong here as much as anybody not able to stay, even though they may have a family, a job, children in school, a whole history. And in Alameda, the idea of roots and longevity is a source of pride. Yet the wealth that's been brought by the computer industry is not all encompassing. It's very selective. And it tends to threaten. The character of to undermine local character. Unless we push for policies that ensure that this wealth also generates public benefits, including affordable housing. I am heartened by the strong support of this Council. I hope we can all work together to build affordable housing without having to rely exclusively on market rate housing. But to replace redevelopment, we really have to work at the state level. There are two bills AB 35 and AB 1335. That we would encourage you to support in the form. Of rebel solutions. I understand the real estate industry is behind them this time. Thank you. I'm speaking with regard to the Alameda home team. We also our members with of. IMHO and we look forward to. Having our second celebration of that at a panel discussion. On May the 15th. Which will start at. 130 in the afternoon. And we're looking forward to having a thorough discussion. Of the elements it really takes to make a community, a community where we talk about housing and jobs in terms not of competing interests. But in interests that complement each other. And we'll have a special invitation for each of you, for anyone that wants to sign up for the attend the panel. And we have a sign up sheet outside. And we look forward to seeing a lot of you to celebrate. Almeida's commitment to housing. For all. Incomes. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, counsel. My name is Neil Saxby. I work for Eaton Housing, which has been building and managing quality, affordable housing around the Bay Area for 45 years. One of the oldest nonprofit housing developers. I'm also a resident of Alameda, but my accent gives me away. I've been living here for ten years. I just wanted to thank you for this proclamation. We've been selected as part of the Alameda Point Partners team and will be the affordable developer at the point. I've been building affordable housing for. Eight years and never. Has it been so difficult to build a new affordable units at a very low and low level. And therefore, we really grateful and and thank you to the Council for supporting efforts at Alameda Point, which will go a long way to building new units. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Risi.

Scott Robinson with Community Planning and Development. This is a request for request to rezone 1330 to 20 second Avenue from YouTube to YouTube zero three with a waiver. The property is located in Council District nine. The City Park West neighborhood is at the southwest corner of Lafayette Street, 22nd Avenue, just north of the Uptown Healthcare District properties about 9000 square feet and currently has a house on it. Request, as I said, is the result from YouTube, which is urban neighborhood context two unit zoning with a 4500 square foot minimum lot size to the same YouTube underlying zone district with the euro three historic use overlay with a waiver. And I'll get into a little bit more of what that means in a minute. But the applicant is requesting the rezoning to allow for the operation of a bed and breakfast infrastructure. The structure and property is part of the Lafayette Street Historic District. It is a contributing structure to the district which was established in 1987. Here you can see the existing zoning with the same YouTube to the south. YouTube with the grocery store structure use overlay to the east, Jimmy Street to the west and you Amex to mixed use zoning. To the north across 22nd have. Here you can see the existing land uses the subject property currently, as I said, has a house on it with a variety of uses. A unit to multi-unit and commercial and mixed use scattered throughout the neighborhood with the hospitals there. So here you can see photos of the surrounding properties, including the subject property in the bottom right photo. As I said, this is currently YouTube and would go to YouTube which allows you urban house duplex and turn of house building forms and single unit into unit residential uses with a 35 foot two and a half storey maximum height. The Euro three, as I said, is the first structure use overlay, which allows some additional nonresidential uses in our historic structures, which this property would be considered a historic structure for those purposes. The additional uses are non-medical offices, art studios and bed and breakfast uses. However, the bed and breakfast uses allowed under the euro three are more restrictive in the bed and breakfast uses allowed under our mixed use districts. Specifically that in the two or three zone districts, the bed and breakfast has to be managed by an on site manager who is also the property owner. In our standard mixed use, some districts still requires an onsite living manager, but that manager does not have to be accompanied or can be an employee. So the request is to waive that requirement that the living manager be an employee, be that living so still required to live in manager would just not have to be the property owner. This is something staff has looked at and thinks makes sense. It's a change we are considering making to the two of three in the future. We just haven't been able to make that change yet. This went to a planning board on October 5th, our August. So I see the unanimous recommendation for approval went to the unanimous Transportation Infrastructure Committee on August 11th. You have in your packet a good neighbor agreement that the absence of sign with some of the surrounding neighborhood organizations and two letters of opposition. In order to approve a rezoning, the city must find that these five criteria have been met. The first criterion is consistency with adopted plans. There are four adopted plan to find this property. The first is comprehensive plan 2040, as described in the staff reports that finds the proposed rezoning consistent with multiple strategies from 2040 relating to historic preservation and providing a mix of uses in neighborhoods specifically in terms of equity. Step finds the proposed rezoning consistent with the strategy for the equitable, equitable and inclusive vision element relating to providing a variety of amenities within neighborhoods. And staff finds the proposed redesign inconsistent with these two strategies from the environmentally resilient vision element. Relating to promoting infill development and providing a mix of uses consistent with the proposed zoning. The second plan is blueprint Denver staff financing from outside the. Plan designates the future neighborhood context for this property as urban, which is consistent with both existing and proposed zone districts. Calls for predominantly residential, but with nonresidential use as mixed in the neighborhood consistent with the proposal. The future place designation is low residential, which again calls for a single and two uses with limited mixed use scattered throughout neighborhoods, including in locations where commercial uses have previously been established. This property has previously been used as an office building and other nonresidential uses. Both 22nd Avenue and Lafayette Street are local streets and some provide local access appropriate for the proposed district and proposed for the property. Falls within the. All other areas of the city. The city's growth area strategy calling for accommodating 10% of the city's new jobs and 20% in housing by 2040. Blueprint number also includes additional strategies and recommendations, some of which relating to historic preservation are appropriate here. The plan promotes providing a variety of uses to encourage adaptive reuse of historic structures, which the proposed zoning would allow. The Blueprint. Denver also includes recommendations about custom zoning, such as waivers. Those are generally discouraged but are appropriate in certain circumstances where a standard zone district wouldn't work and other criteria are met. Staff finds that this is a situation where a custom done district with a waiver is appropriate. The the standard zoned district would be too restrictive in this case, or a mixed use zone district would allow what the applicant is requesting would not be appropriate in this location either. So customs and industry is appropriate here as a bridge to a future text amendment as I believe this is the change we are intending to make in the future to the other for you to restrict your third plan is the Uptown Neighborhood Plan from 1986. It calls for a vibrant urban village with a variety of uses and encourages reinvestment in the neighborhoods. This falls under the subdistrict that's called Midtown in the plan, which calls for allowing nonresidential uses where they have previously been established and also heavily promotes historic preservation, which is consistent with the proposed district. And the final plan is the Uptown Health Care District Plan updates. It mostly focuses on what happens on the Uptown Healthcare District campus, but also has some recommendations for what should happen around the campus, including in this location calling for a variety of uses to support and accommodate growth in neighborhoods complementary to the hospitals. Staff finds that the proposed rezoning would meet the recommendations of the Uptown Health Care District plan and finds the first criteria met. The second criterion is uniformity of district regulations. That finds the proposed rezoning would result in the uniform application of custom zone districts in this case. The third criterion is to further the public health, safety and general welfare. City staff finds the proposed rezoning would do so by implementing the city's plans and promoting historic preservation, adaptive reuse of a structure. The fourth criterion is justifying circumstances that finds the proposed rezoning is justified by change and changing conditions in the area. Particularly, there's been significant new investment on the campus of the cinema and justice building and other construction in the area. Increasing the demand of. Of visitors to the hospitals and surrounding areas. So allowing additional nonresidential uses in this location, including bed and breakfast uses, it could be used by people. Visiting the hospital is appropriate. In addition, applying use overlays meets an additional criteria in the justifying circumstances for helping to preserve neighborhoods and provide additional needed standards. And then the fifth criterion is consistency within the context of purpose and intent. Staff finds the proposed rezoning would result in development consistent with the urban neighborhood context and the zone district purpose and intent of the move to the Zone District. That staff finds all five criteria are met and recommends approval. I'll be happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Scott, for your report. Council has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 20 20794 and we have two individuals signed up to speak this evening. The first speaker is Anton Attia, and I'm sorry if I mispronounced your name. Hello. Okay, go ahead. So we started for some reason, so. Yeah. My name is Antoine. I'm the petitioner. And I'm. In my shoes. Just a quick comment about the two letters that we got that were saying no. One of them ended up because we did a good neighborhood agreement and that person agreed on it and signed on it. And the second letter, we think that the person did not understand the objective of what we're doing, because he was talking about, I don't want you to tear down the building and build the duplex, which which is not what we are doing. I think he misread he misread the you know, the the sign on the, you know, on the property. That was just my two comments were not open. To any questions if. You if you have any. I think you were in the the public comment portion right now. And so we have another speaker. And then there might be questions for you by members of council. Our second speaker is Jesse Paris. We're working on getting you unmuted here, Jesse. All right or. Working on getting Jesse back in. All right. Unfortunately, I'm no longer seeing Jesse in the queue. And either attendees or. Panelists here, and so we'll go ahead and proceed. Are there questions from members of councils? Sorry, I was buying time here, Jesse. All right. Go ahead, Jesse. And also not just because of what was left behind. The cell block. Stocks of all facilities. The maximum. The Colorado and Mile. I feel like 2020. The. Jesse, if you want to turn off your camera. Just drive when it comes to the made. Yeah. We might need you to turn off your camera, Jesse, so we can hear your audio. Okay. So she disappeared. Now Blackstone Examiner discovered the first positive actually coming for social change. It's all in my mind this year, in 2023. I will do anything tonight. The I saw the criteria so I can say my name is. I just had to push through the acquisition of technical difficulty. So I think I'm starting with those letters of opposition. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Jesse. That concludes our speakers questions from members of council. Councilwoman Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. Hey, Scott. So. On Registrar. The council staff report, unfortunately, is not the staff report that matches up with this rezoning. So none of us are able to see the application or read the letters of opposition. It's it's four one in University Park by DU. So I'm wondering if there's any way that you could email it to us because I'm having a hard I'd normally do a lot of I didn't want to interrupt the presentation, but the app, the on your staff, the one that you have posted is 25, 35 through 25, 45 as very avenue. So none of us on council are able to see the staff report which is. What I see a lot of questions on. Yeah. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened there. I guess I'm happy to email the staff report to all of you. I can do that real quick. And I went in, Councilman, when I initially went in, I had the same problem. But then I went in through Granicus and it was let me see everything, but we'll go ahead and have Scott email. Okay. Okay, we've got it. We just emailed. That's all that told me so. Okay. Can I have a few minutes? I'll come back in the queue, but I want to just read the comments. Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Madam President, I wanted to ask a question of our city attorney. Do we have someone from the city attorney's office on? Yes, we have Nate Lucero. Okay, Nate. So first of all, let me ask somebody on our staff if the public which which of the two systems the public gets to review those documents from? Because if they're the wrong information, my question is whether or not that poses any legal challenges for us in terms of what they get to view and respond to . So can someone on our staff clarify which system the public can see the documents from? Is it granicus or like to start? Sack or. Mr. O'Brien. And both of the latest are. In I legislate. As well as critics are all one system. The files are up there, just errant. Files in one of the. Locations. But the files of Scott reference are up there and you upload. Them and reexport now to. But this the files have not changed since the. Due. Date which for the 22nd have any files. Okay. Well, okay. So I just wanted to clarify with our city attorney if if the public was not able to view them as Councilman Sandoval is raising, is there any legal issues with us proceeding tonight? Given that concern, I mean, I'm hearing you say they're there now. Or they will be there. But I just want to ask that question. Nate, would you mind addressing my question? Yeah. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. New research assistant city attorney. So it would not be an issue with counsel to starting this matter this evening, so long as all noticing requirements have been met. Then staff has met their notice obligations with the notice staff usually provides contact information. And so if members of the public were worried about viewing documents, always contact staff and request those documents or request how to view those documents. So I don't have any issues with counsel deciding this matter this evening. Okay. Thank you, Nate. Thank you, Zach. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilman Sandoval. Wanted to give you a little bit more time if you had a question. I'm almost done. Just a few more minutes. Thank you. All right. Councilman Flynn, we'll go ahead and go to you. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think I knew the answer to this, so I wasn't going to chime in. But just in the interest of filling the time here to give Councilwoman Sandoval time she needs. Could you, Scott, clarify for me or confirm for me that the essential point of this rezoning seems to be to allow the owner of the property to have a manager reside in the bed and breakfast rather than he or she as the owner. Because one of the requirements is that they have to be an owner. And the justification for it, as I read in the staff report on the mess or in the presentation, is that the underlying zoned district does allow for a non property owner to be the resident manager. Is that the I have that correct or did I get something wrong? The first part is correct. What you described the request is absolutely correct. It's to. Allow the resident manager, other than the. Owner to live. On the property and operate the. The reason that the sporting aspect of the criteria is because this is additional restrictions placed upon practices in the other three overlay and is not applicable in mixed use districts for the same breakfast use except things that are restricted. Otherwise the criterion transport and is looking to change that in the future in a future text amendment to allow this in all your three jump districts. So that's why staff is supporting it and thinks it meets the criteria. And it is this property a bed and breakfast at the moment? No. Okay. Thank you, Madam President. All right. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Hines. But thank you, Madam Chair. I was going to. To take a look what time looks like. Council Member Singapore is ready. So I just. Wanted to. Thank staff for all their hard work. Here's to you, Mr. Robertson. Thank you, Madam President. Or both, Madam. President and manager. Thank you, Councilman. Councilwoman Sandoval, go ahead with your questions. So thank you so much for the time to review this staff report. You have to tell me how to get to the backside of Grande in case I don't want it to shrink. So scar on the documents that I was sent. Did the manager of revision real estate end up signing the good the good neighbor agreement? Yes. Yeah, I think it should be. They're all on different sheets. Crikey. Yeah, I see. Most of are no signs, but the manager of of the mansion didn't sign. So I was just hoping that somewhere in the paper trail that there's a. Executed on the owner and the good neighbor and the the ah knows that that's executed. So that's that's that's simple. You can get back to me on that if you need. And then. Are there other areas are there. So if you wanted to do this, you all three. Is it like sports? Is it structure by structure? And the structure has to meet a certain type of criteria. Yeah. So the you oh three applies to a lot of properties, especially in this part of town. Um, if you look at the zoning back, you see the properties just to the east across Lafayette for all zone you have three. And for many of those properties you are three. Doesn't do anything for that because as you said, you have to meet additional criteria, one of which is being in a historic structure, either individually landmarked or a contributing structure to a historic district, which this property is. And then even beyond that, there are additional requirements relating to the size of the property, such as the structure that have to be necessary to be allowed. Okay. And then the i, i it's probably totally user error to make. What were the two letters of opposition that came in for this reason? Me. What concerns? Yes. So there's one that came in from a Christopher Love Joe that was concerned about. The impacts of a bed breakfast relating to traffic, parking and noise as they are considered. This person was then a party to the agreement, so presume their concerns have been satisfied by the conditions of the agreement. Then there was another one from a Julien Chalabi that was concerned about the structure being torn down and this being split into two properties and do question on it. And as they said, that's not the intent of this property or of this region with the storm structure on it. It couldn't be torn down without approval from written permission to build new structures. Okay, that's it. Thank you, Madam President, and thank you for your patience with this process. All right. Thank you. Councilman Sandoval. The public hearing for Council Bill 20 20794 is closed.

We're now going to move on to the first item of business that we mentioned here, which is going to be item 16, which is an item about the Aquarium of the Pacific. Madam Clerk. Report from City Manager Recommendation to approve payments to Aquarium of the Pacific for the $10.7 million balance of a $15 million aquarium challenge grant to be paid from Tidelands operating funds as part of the funding for the Pacific Visions Project. I think are we before we begin here, I think we have a staff report first. And so, Dr. Schubert, we're going to let the staff do the report and then we'll we'll begin. Doctor, you can say their doctor should be very, very brief. So council members and mayor, the Aquarium of the Pacific, the Long Beach Aquarium is facing a dilemma right now. They need to expand for the demand that they've created. If we I'm not comparing the aquarium to an amusement park, but if you look around us, you have Universal Studios had to add things like the Transformers. Disneyland continues to reinvent itself and add things. Knott's Berry Farm, of course, Ghost Town and Camp Snoopy. And with the economy of the Pacific, they're adding Pacific visions. And basically they're they're faced with an issue. And the experts and consultants that they brought on board are saying in order to meet your demand and increase your attendance and create new revenue, you need to expand and create a new opportunity for the public. So this is Pacific Visions. Dr. Schaeuble and his team are going to walk us through this in just a moment. It's a $53 million addition funded almost entirely by pledged donations, ours included. It'll meet their demand. It'll increase attendance, meet the demand of the region. It'll enhance the guest experience. It'll attract new visitors, not just new visitors, but donors as well. And it'll also maintain our position as America's premier aquarium. So we the big deal for the council to look at tonight is we have a challenge grant of $15 million that we were providing to the aquarium through Tidelands 100% through Tidelands throughout a 10 to 15 year period. We've already provided approximately $4.3 million. But in order to go forward, we were providing that as funds accumulated through Tidelands. In order to go forward, the aquarium needs to make a firm commitment on approximately the $10 million that's left. So we have it's in your packet, a scenario on how we're going to fund that. We're actually funding in fiscal year 17, $1.5 million of that that's already been approved. Dr. Schaeuble, the check is released tomorrow. And then we also have refunded our Rainbow Harbor bonds. And with the dollars that have come free from that, that'll take care of us for the last couple of years and at least $500,000 throughout the next six years. And we're not looking at any capital projects in Tidelands that this will be backed up against basically operations. And quite honestly, during the past decade or so, we've always had a surplus of about $700,000 in operations and title. And so that's the money that we would be utilizing to commit to this challenge. Grant So that Dr. Schaeuble and the team could go to the bank and know that it's coming. So with that, I'd like to answer any questions anybody has or turn it over to. The good doctor. I'm going I'm going to turn this over to Dr. Schaeuble in just a minute. Let me just also just to add to what the city manager said. So I just want to just, you know, take a little bit different also of of comments and just say that the aquarium is a, first of all, world class institution. And we are incredibly proud to have this not just a tourist attraction, but this is an educational center. This is an academic center. It's a a place that is rescuing teaching. It is a leading, leading place for science when it comes to climate change. And I just really proud of all the work, Dr. Schaeuble, that you and the board and Dr. Molina and just the whole board have been involved with on this incredible project. And so we're very excited about this project. We're very supportive of the work you've already done. And just look forward to the future of this partner. Incredible partnership and the, you know, the millions of of young minds that you continue to teach every single day to learn about our planet and to learn about being a good stewards of our environment. And so thank you for your incredible work. Dr. SCHAEUBLE. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Anibal Maria Garcia, members of the City Council and senior city staff and city manager. We appreciate this opportunity to be here. I'm Jerry Schauble, president of the aquarium, and I'm joined this evening by the immediate past chair of our board of board of Directors, Dr. Mario Molina, who chairs the Pacific Visions campaign and is a charter member and by a charter member of the board, Ross Hill, who service goes back to 1998 before the aquarium ever opened. And we're joined by a number of of our staff over here to my left. And later, we'll be joined by a penguin and a talking bird. And that should be entertaining. Tonight, you as as the mayor has said, you're going to vote on a measure to approve the final 10.7 million of the city's $15 million pledge to the $53 million expansion of the aquarium. Lola, our talking bird is programed, but she can be unpredictable and she probably has two responses depending upon how the vote goes. One One of them may be R-rated. So before you take your vote, my colleagues and I would like to make just a few remarks about the aquarium to remind you of a number. Of things about about it. We're coming to the end of the most successful year in our history. We will have 1.7 million visitors. We have 113,000 members. 13,000 from Long Beach. 3.1 million website users. 140,000 people who follow us on social media and 730,000 YouTube views. 500 million. Our reach through PR and advertising. We reach 1.6 million visitors teachers, rather, on the online PBS Learning Media, and we reach 110 museums, science centers and aquariums through our science on a sphere network. And we also have forums, lectures, workshops, and we broadcast a lot of these online to reach a very large audience. Financially, this has been a, again, the best year in our history, $37 million in unrestricted revenue. We're on track to have the strongest year ever. Annual economic impact is more than $60 million for Long Beach and 160 million for Los Angeles and Orange counties. And in the past decade, we've been able to invest more than $25 million back into the facility, and none of those dollars were city dollars. They were from the successful operation of the aquarium. And over that decade, we've been able to contribute $22 million toward the city's debt service and the aquarium. Within the Long Beach community itself, we have 1500 volunteers, 25% of whom live in Long Beach and those. Volunteers contribute about 160000 hours every year. We have climate resiliency programs for the city. We have a live program with Miller Children's Hospitals Hospital where they can talk to our vet when he's doing checkups on animals. We engage local artists, performers and cultural groups at the Aquarium of Cultural Festivals, and the operating company has never missed a covenant from the implementation agreement, which I'm going to ask Ross Hill to comment on in just a minute, because over the years he's been the primary architect of all of that. So we've never missed a rent payment of $2.2 million, and we've never failed to reinvest at least 6% of the operating revenue in enhancing the city's facility this year. We will exceed that by a couple of million, and since June of 1998, this has become the most distinctive aquarium in the country and perhaps in the world. And to give a little bit of context, I want Ross Hill to make a few comments. He served as chair of the board on four different occasions. Ross. Thank you, Jerry. It shows I'm not a very good. Recruiter that I kept operating as the chair. But actually some of you may know, some of you may not know that the choir was originally formed as a strong partnership between a private, not for profit operating corporation in the city. And that has been really, really important because that's what's allowed us to raise private capital to help build the city's aquarium. We couldn't have done that otherwise. And in this project, as Jerry mentioned, it's $53 million with 15 million coming from the city. We've been through several iterations in financing, and I think most of that predates this board, but it's called an implementation agreement because it is the document that allows us to work together but still meet the bond covenants. And that's a very complicated document indeed. As Jerry said, we've never missed a covenant and we pay the rent to the city and the operating expenses. So I believe it's become the most distinctive aquarium in the country with a combination of superb animal husbandry, our use of media technology and convening and in participating with groups , talking about the environment and about cultural issues, as the mayor indicated before. I'd like Jerry to show. You some more highlights of that. And so some of the. Strength of that partnership with the community is shown on this slide. We have a huge number of partnerships. Mola, Queen, Mary, Long Beach Airport. I'll let you look at these. I won't read them all, but the list grows every year. We also have partnerships with local businesses, restaurants through our Future Seafood for the Future program that includes Parker's Lighthouse, King Seafood and Gladstone's. And we also partner with Molina Health Care and Boeing. One of the challenges is to make the aquarium accessible, since we have a lot of people in Long Beach who can't afford to come to the aquarium, even though we are much less expensive than going to Universal Studios or to Disneyland. So we have a number of programs. We send 50% off coupons to all the residents. We have passes at Long Beach public libraries that people can go check them out and take a family of four to the aquarium. We have the free nights that are hosted by the mayor and the city council. Every Friday night we have free Shrek Lagoon nights and we we participate as an institution in many parades and festivals across the city. And we support local charities through ticket donations, coupons and venue use educational programs. The mayor mentioned we are an educational institution and we are we're an informal educational institution and we specialize in lifelong learning. We have programs all the way from pre-K up through retired people. We get more than up to 200,000 educational visits every year, more than 10,000 from Long Beach. 35,867 are free. 30,000 get served by our aquarium on wheels. If people can't come to the aquarium, we take the aquarium on wheels to them. We have the most extensive and diverse lecture system anywhere in Southern California that includes all the universities and colleges. This year will end up with 42 lectures that are all streamed live. We have Aquatic Academy courses. The one we'll be giving in the spring has to do with sustainability. It will build on the strength of what the city is doing and focus the spotlight on the city of Long Beach. And we will have the National Academy of Sciences here to underscore the importance of what this city is doing. We have programs and events for teachers and homeschool families, and we do a lot with the visual and the performing arts. That's another thing that makes us distinctive. The use of media technology in combining the arts and the sciences are among our signature programs. Pacific Visions When It Opens. It will increase the number of visitors by at least 200,000 in the first year. The majority of those will come from outside of the city, but they will spend money here. They'll spend money not only on parking, and that will yield at least a half a million dollars to the city since the city receives those revenues. They will eat in our restaurants, and we hope many of them will also stay overnight when it's when we expand. This new building will be an architectural icon that will attract people to Long Beach just to see the building. It will serve as a world class, educational and arts institution that will engage the public like never before, and it will tackle the planet's most pressing issues. It will be the most powerful platform in the world outside of the military, that allows the public to explore alternative pathways to the future and determine how our actions collectively will determine the future. We actually have. And now I would like to turn it over to Mario Molina. Thank you. So, first of all, I would like to thank the city and thank all of you for your support. None of what the aquarium has done would be possible without the city's support. This slide shows you what the expansion will look like. It will be a glass covered building. It will be iconic. And I think people will come just to see the building itself, frankly. I'm very excited about this. You know, Jerry talked to you about our attendance. We are bursting at the seams. This gives us additional capacity, and it will bring more visitors. More visitors means more parking revenue. It means more people visiting restaurants and local businesses. So I think this is going to be very good for the local economy. Can I get the next. Yes, go ahead. I just. Press. Yeah. We have a short video we want to show you. It's about 90 seconds now. And there's no guarantee that you. Get somebody in with the trigger. This there's no green arrow for us. Okay. Our world has been a place of creation. Devastation. And regeneration. For 4.6. Billion years. The only constant. Has been change in the past few thousand years. Our ingenuity has led to incredible progress. But we've accelerated the pace of change. The impact on our natural world. His profound nature can no longer keep up. To solve these challenges. The Aquarium of the Pacific invites you to join us in creating a thriving planet.

And we have a couple of visitors we want. To bring out bring out our visitors. And while we're bringing them out, I also I want to thank you personally. This wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the support of the city. And it wouldn't be possible, though, if we to create this kind of an institution in most cities. We're very fortunate to be in Long Beach, and in spite of what you hear sometimes and read in the media, it is not hopeless. We have the knowledge, the tools and the technology to create a glorious future, and that's what we're all about. So if you would like to will be happy to answer any questions from any of you on the council and if you'd like to have your picture taken with any of these animals. No. Did we ever get to it? Did you ever teach Lola to say thank you? No. He says it, but not. Well. What is Lola do if it sees a shark? What do. You do? You see a shark? Thank you, Dr. Schaeuble. I have some some councilmembers that have some some comments in question. So let me get through those and then we'll go to get to the vote and. Then we'll take some pictures. So. Absolutely. Thank you. You guys are saying, all right, that's great. Let me go and get through this. I know. Council woman Pierce, you made the motion. Yes. I am very excited to have you guys here today. I remember one of my first briefings I had after stepping into office was on this project and kind of that question of what do we want to do? And and this is something we as a city want to invest in. And I think your team and your staff really have demonstrated partnership and vision and every aspect we've made along the way around partnering in our parks or along our beaches to expand the great work that you guys are already doing. You guys are your whole team is right there. And I just really want to say your team is are some of my favorite people to meet with and give them a round of applause for all of their hard work that they do. And I think you guys did a great job of laying out the numbers, the economic impact. What is it going to mean for tourism? What is it going to mean for the city? I've had the privilege of getting to know a penguin and getting to know Molly and of course, Betty, two of our otters that you guys have. And one thing that was really exciting to hear is one of our orders that we have, the typical lifespan, guys of an otter in captivity is around 10 to 12 years. We have an order in Long Beach that is the oldest living otter in the world in captivity. That doesn't tell you it's about to be 20. That doesn't tell you how much people in our aquarium really care. It's we should be really proud to have a great facility like this. My mother brought me behind the scenes at places like aquariums and SeaWorld to try to enlighten me on what did it mean to be compassionate , to care for those that couldn't fight for themselves. And it was really animals that did that in spaces like yours. And so I wholeheartedly support this investment in one of our city structures. And I really think that the city staff are doing the hard work to try to get to the numbers that made sense for everybody. And I think that Long Beach is just going to be better for all the work that you guys have done. So thank you very much. Thank you. The second of the motion was Councilwoman Price. Do I echo the comments of my colleague? And I want to thank you for your excellent work and the presentation tonight. I will say my my favorite part of the proposal and the budget aspect of it is that it will not impact any existing or future projects out of the Tidelands area. That's a real concern for those of us who fund many city assets through that that particular budget. I think it's a great added benefit to the city. And again, I'm very much looking forward to being a continued partner with the aquarium, seeing the great work that you do and seeing the facility open. And thank you so much for bringing in our special guests. The Girl Scouts are here tonight and they were so excited, I asked them to stay so that they could see the live penguin and bird. So thank you very much for being here. And again, we look forward to a continued partnership. Thank you. Thank you. Next up, we have Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you. And I just want to say what amazing presentation that was. I can tell you that, you know, community is clear, your commitment to community. It was clear in that presentation and it's clear in terms of what you do in your partnership in the community from, you know, the the free knights of the curiam to the sponsorship of local events, the mobile aquarium. I think it's really clear people are proud that this aquarium is ours. And, you know, I you know, the part that struck me differently now than before was the part in the video when it showed the young person walking along the beach and said, we have to think about the future . You know, my you know, my daughter loves fish. We only have one little fish, just one. We got a 70 gallon saltwater aquarium with one fish. And and I've got to protect that fish, because if that fish comes up missing, I'm going to be accountable for it. So I totally get it. But I'm a you know, I just think it's amazing to have an asset. And I would say to the level of, you know, Knott's Berry Farm at Disney, like, we have that level of stature in our region to have that here is a real asset and we should invest in it and we should protect it because it's a community asset and it adds real value to Long Beach. So keep up the good work. You obviously have my support here and let's keep an open door. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Mongo. I want to thank you for being here, and I want to thank you for the partnership that you have in the community. I received a couple of calls today from some misinformation that was out there about what the council item was tonight. And so I want you to know that your supporters are out there following what's going on and ensuring that this great asset that we do have will be held in perpetuity and that the city council, along with the city staff, know and understand what's what's moving forward and what that information is. So thank you for what you do. Thank you for those at home who said they would be watching to ensure that this was exactly what I said it would be. And thank you for for holding true to what you've promised the community and your donors, because that's very important as well. Thank you. Councilman Gonzales. Much of what I wanted to say already has been said. But I also want to thank you and congratulations for all your hard work at the aquarium and really your commitment to sustainability and environmentalism. I know that's really important for the aquarium and certainly I appreciate it. So thank you very much. Councilman Andrews. I think you may also like to echoed the sentiments which are said here on the diocese, because the aquarium, you know, the Pacific is very visible and successful, you know, in our nonprofit organization I City. But also, I'd like to mention you that the addition to this specific vision, you know, is going to be a wonderful and a magnet to be attracted to everyone visit to the city of Long Beach. And that would be one big way we can afford to pay for it. So you guys continue to do what you're doing. Thank you very much. And that one visit a week is very important to my district. And I want to thank you so much for allowing us to do that. Thank you again. Thank you. Council member Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. I, too, are supporting this this motion. Your aquarium on wheels was absolutely amazing. You did the first one at Hudson Elementary School and West Long Beach. We're very proud of that, that we were the first and continue the good work. And I hope that you can expand that program to include bigger and better displays. Take them out to maybe a shark or a mobile shark tank. I wasn't scared. The bird. Thank you very much. Thank you. Councilmember Pierce. Yeah. I just wanted to take a second while we have everybody's attention on the aquarium to say that our aquarium night is on the 19th and that the team here, David, and everybody, have been great. We are stepping it up and we're going to be doing a pledge drive for sustainability because you guys are making that such a a key part of your work. And so we'll have the city departments at the aquarium getting people that are showing up for free night to sign up and pledge to be sustainable on a number of different issues. And so just wanted to highlight that while everyone was, you know, thinking about these cute guys. We'll see on the 19th. Thank you. And as we go to a to a vote, I just want to obviously, Mario, Russ, Jerry and the whole team, thank you. And I think it's important for everyone to note that everything you've heard today is amazing. It's wonderful. It's the right thing to do. But at the same time, the work that I'm always most proud of is that the aquarium is leading our efforts on the climate change conversation in the city of Long Beach right now, and that is so critical for the future of our planet and sea level rise. This community and I want to thank you, Jerry. You've brought together scientists from across the country to advise us, counsel and advise me on what's happening, what the issues are. And it's that kind of work that you can't put a price on that you're doing every day. And I just just thank you for for your efforts there. Very important work. So thank you. Members, please go ahead and cast their votes. Motion carries. Great. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Would anyone like a picture with one of them? Yeah, we're going to we're going to come over here right now. Let's all do a picture. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Really? I've heard that. I'm going to do it right here. I just. I don't have my glasses. Tell me where to sign. Right here. Signature in my name. Okay. Yeah. Real quick. Just a quick announcement. I think in. All the. Real quick and all the penguin excitement, we didn't do public comment. So if there. Is public comment, if there is public comment, we should do it now. And if there is any interest, we could we could we can just vote one more time, but that we need to do public comment. Is there any public comment? Please come forward on this item on the aquarium? Yes. Okay. Certainly a commendable project. And I think we should also take hats off to former mayors Tom Clark and Ernie Kell. That champion had the vision had the vision back then to see the value of this and push this thing forward. Before there was the aquarium and so forth. Without that. Initial push, it would never would have gotten off the ground. Thank you. Any other public comment? I see no other public comment. We're going to take the vote one more time just to be extra sure. We don't want to have to do it again. So just checking in with the city attorney. We don't have to do a motion to reconsider just a revote. Correct. Okay. So no other public comment. CNN members, please go out and cast your cash for votes. There's a motion and a second there. Motion carries. Thank you. That's what this penguin studio sometimes. Okay. Thank you. We're going to move on to the next the next item, which is our 1% for the arts program item. I'm going to have the cork with the item number 17. Please report from city manager recommendation to receive and file a report on the feasibility and recommendations for establishing a percent for the Arts Program City. Thank you. I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and make some opening comments and then I'm going to turn this over to our staff to devote go through. By the way, I still see it on here.

Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-352 is open. May we have the staff report, please? Thank you. Council President Gilmore and good evening. Members of the City Council. My name is Lily Jones. I'm with CPD Planning Services and today I'll be presenting the Farnworth Area Plan Amendment. My presentation is about 10 to 15 minutes long, and I will briefly cover the existing 2019 adopted plan, followed by a quick reminder on what initiated the plan amendment. And then I will wrap up with the summary of the staff report. So some of you were part of the vote that adopted what was then the very first neighborhood plan amendment or the very first Neighborhood Planning Initiative, which was the part of these area plans back in June of 2019. The adoption went through a 24 month planning process, which I was heavily involved with as a part of program project management team. And between 2017 and 2019, Community Planning and Development worked closely with the far northeast community to put together a really comprehensive plan that provides great guidance from and below Gateway, Green Valley Ranch and the DIA neighborhoods. And this great plan will continue to serve the far northeast community for years to come. The framework of the plan, which was adopted in 2019, address land use in built form, mobility and quality of life and infrastructure. And as you recognize, these are three elements of the complete neighborhood as prescribed by or in the blueprint Denver. The original 2019 plan adoption went through 20 steering committee meetings, five public meetings, one design charrette, and over 50 participations and community events attended by CPD staff, including myself. But today we're presenting to you a focus area upon amendment to the, ironically, the far northeast corner of the neighborhood. And the boundary of the plan amendment was predefined by their large development review, which is bounded by the future 72nd Avenue to the North Himalaya street to the east, the existing High Point Boulevard to the south, and then Argonne Street here to the to the on the western edge. An amendment to the recently adopted plan was needed in order to accommodate the relocation of Pepsi Bottling plant from its current location on Pruyn Avenue to the DIA neighborhood. There are four main components that were addressed or rather amended in this plan. The first is that we amended the land use designation to the specific area which was previously identified as a community center. And a community center is a place type that is intended to support a variety of mixed uses but doesn't support light, industrial or manufacturing uses. Therefore, to support a use like Pepsi Bottling Company, this area had to change its place type designation to value manufacturing, as you see identified here and on the map in Violet. The reason we had previously identified this as a mixed use is that we have we had anticipated that a light rail stop, I'm just going to call it out right here at the intersection of 72nd and Avenue and Himalaya was going to be developed. But since the adoption of this plan, we've learned that there are no plans to develop the light rail in the next 20 years. And so a mixed use would be difficult to support here without this light red light rail station. I should also remind you that the dark diagonal lines that we see indicated on the map, that's just to show us that residential isn't allowed north of 64th Avenue due to the disease influence area overlay. And so the change in place type from a community center to valley manufacturing is also needed to support the rezoning which my colleague Scott Robinson will present after me. The second change in the plan amendment is the change that had to be heard to be made to the Mobility Network in this area. Roads and mobility networks are highly dependent on the land use designations. And so with the changes of land use. We we don't need as many roads to connect across this this portion of the. The third man component amended in this plan is the transformative project in the DA neighborhood. This was previously called out as a line station at 72nd and Himalaya Street. But again, as I've already mentioned, this is no longer within the horizon of this plan. We have amended the transformative project to be Employment Center north of 64th Avenue. I do want to point out that there's still some language here and actually all throughout the plan that support the light rail stop in this area in case anything changes. And lastly, there are additional red lines throughout the plant that speak to either design quality, mobility, placemaking aspects, community outreach or just specific to the development of new manufacturing or light industrial uses in the far northeast community. We also facilitated market analysis for this area, which reported to which reported that the greenfield sites north of 64th Avenue where residential is restricted due to the the airport overlay. What's what was shown is that what's appropriate is light, industrial and manufacturing growth in this area. So this report also pointed out that industrial jobs have significantly higher wages when compared to hospitality. And hospitality is what we have previously seen develop in this area. So with hospitality jobs paying on average 1260 per hour versus $30 per hour, which is what the industrial wages are paying. So the market analysis also reported that the hotel corridor will remain strong along Tower Road. But again, the greenfield sites on the western and eastern ends of tower would be more appropriate to support light, industrial or manufacturing uses. There are three main criteria there are laid out in our plan 2044 evaluating area plants and plant amendments, and they are to assure that an inclusive community process was used to develop the kind of amendment that the plan amendment is consistent with the vision, goals and strategies of the plan. And then the plan amendments demonstrates a long term view. The pre-planning for the amendment started late in the summer of 2021, and we had our first steering committee meeting in October of last year, followed by a public meeting in December. We had a second steering committee meeting in February and we also sent out multiple email blasts and put out to a two week public review draft. I have three slides that touch on the most common themes that we heard throughout the public outreach process. The forerunner of these community asks for a community engagement strategy. And so we added recommendations in the plan that speak to building and establishing partnerships not just with Pepsi, but with any future employment uses, especially when it comes to job recruitment in the community and providing scholarships for certificate training and professional development for the far northeast community . We've also heard the community ask for transit access to the new employment centers, and we've included language that support shuttle services, for example, that connect people from transit stops to employment centers. An exemplar could be of that could be a shuttle from the existing 61st and Pena Boulevard to the Pepsi facility. We've also heard the community feedback regarding anticipated truck traffic along town roads and the impact it will have on road maintenance in. Well, Tower Road was designed to accommodate freight and large volumes of traffic. We did language into the plan that speak to developing road maintenance for Tower Road. Pepsi has also expressed their commitment to changing their fleet to all electrical vehicles by 2030, which will mitigate noise and air pollution due to truck. Truck traffic. The community also expressed that they wanted to make sure that benefits that were integrated into the hypo in general development plan for this area were not lost in the amendment process . And we have language of the plan that supports that specific to this property as it regards to open space trail networks, bridges and roadway connections. And those are all being carried over in the GDP update. Finally, the staff finds that the Foreign Office Area Plan Amendment was developed through an inclusive public process. So in regards to plan consistency specific to the comprehensive plan 2014, the far Northeast Area Plan Amendment is consistent with 31 individual goals and 67 strategies covering the topics of affordable housing, international intentional growth and development, supporting culturally rich and inclusive communities. Multi-Modal connectivity. Parks and open space. Health and safety and economic vitality. With regards to Blueprint Denver, the Farnworth area plan amendments address 22 individual policies and 53 individual strategies that cover topics such as land use and build form. Housing and transportation. Mobility and quality of life. The Map amendment stayed consistent with the previously adopted plan, and changes to these maps were only made within the amendment boundary. Steph therefore finds that the far north these area upon amendment is consistent with the comprehensive plan 2040 as well as the blueprint Denver. Lastly, SAP finds that the far northeast area plan amendment was developed with a long term vision and view building on the originally adopted 2019 plan. And so upon conclusion of this analysis, staff recommends approval of the in area plan amendment with conditions that the document would be edited for clarity and correctness. And with that, I thank you for your time. Attention. All right. Thank you, Lily, for the staff report. And we have five individuals signed up to speak this evening. And our first speaker is Steve Lawrence. Joining us here in chambers. Oh, okay. I will. Mr. Lawrence is attending, but is declining to speak. And so we'll go ahead and move on. Martin Wallace, who's joining us via Zoom. Go ahead, please, Martin. You'll have to unmute yourself. I. Good evening. Hello. Go ahead, please. Martin. You can go ahead and start. All right. We're going to see if we can get. MARTIN, you're the only I think we've got one other virtual. We'll go ahead and see if we can get. Martin back in the queue. All right. Well, we're trying to get Martin. We'll go in chambers. John Bennett is. We're in the public comment portion. The public speaker portion. You'll have 3 minutes to speak, sir. Thank you. Members of the City Council. My name is John Benitez. I have the privilege of being a resident of the city in county of Denver with my wife for 42 years. I'm here today. To discuss. The impact of the decision you are about to make. And I'm hoping that I can draw your attention, your focus on the importance of it in relation to a building that is in the path of progress here at 6850 argon. Eight years ago, I formed a company called BD Omni. We purchased a building in 68, 50, 68, 60 and 68, 90 Garden Street. I was hoping to be able to show you where it is on this map. But we are at the intersection of Oregon Street and 69th Avenue. Right now that property by the Army leases all of its space to seven tenants, one of which is the Denver Public Schools. We have a full fledged high school called Legacy Options High School with 125 students. We have administrative staff, a cafeteria, a gymnasium, principal's office. It's a full fledged high school. We have a church. We have five other tenants that are in the buildings. There are three buildings. The Church and a TV production company are situated. In the property that is and there. Premises are about 50 feet, which is almost the length of this dais for the city council members. From 69th Avenue. What we've learned and why am I here? I'm here not to promote my property. I'm here because there has been a lack of information given to us concerning a very pivotal decision made by Dottie. And I understand the accolades and I support them with respect to what Dotty has done for the city and county of Denver. What a decision that was made and indicates that the primary ingress and egress for 300 to 400. To up to I have read 900 tractor trailer trucks will be going past our building within 55 feet of it every day. Every day to go to the Pepsi Bottling plant. The Pepsi Bottling plant. Let's be clear about it is a 1.2 million square foot facility that will grow to 1.7 million. It'll start with 500 employees, which is terrific. They purportedly will come in from a different angle, but we will have 300 to 400 to 900 trucks a day. We have a lot of speakers. Everybody gets 3 minutes. And so we're going to go ahead and transition to the next speaker. Thank you for being here. And folks can ask you to come up for any questions that they might have. Next, we're going to Jesse Perez online. Yes. Members of council may be. Yes. Yes. Oh, good evening. My name is Justice for Black Star Action, Movement for Self Defense, Positive Action, Comment for Social Change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado, the East Denver Residents Council, front line Black News. And I'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023. And I live in District eight. And Councilman Hern, this district I'm in favor of this amendment to the far northeast plan for the green bill, a greenfield site to accommodate market demand since the plan's adoption. My question is, what exactly is going to be put here? I keep hearing it's either going to be a Pepsi facility or a community center. If someone please answer that question, I would greatly appreciate it. It meets. The three criteria consistency with the Northeast Denver plan consistency with Blueprint Denver and the long term view. Or efficient. So I'm in favor of the three amendments excuse me, to the Far East or Northeast plan. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Brian Conley. Good evening, Madam President, and members of Council. My name is Brian Connolly. I am with the firm of Otten, Johnson, Robinson, Neff and Ragan Eddy here in Denver. And I have the privilege of representing PepsiCo Beverages North America on the two matters that are before you this evening. As Lilly explained also, I should thank Lilly. She's done an excellent job of processing this area. Plant Amendment. As Lilly explained through the large development review process, we received feedback that an area plan amendment would be required, and we submitted a letter on March 9th of this year before the Planning Board hearing explaining our position in support of this area plant amendment. That's before you this evening. I would like to take this time to just mention three things, which I think underline Pepsi's support of the area plant amendment and why we think it's important to the city. First, manufacturing is really important to our community. We need to support its continued development. Manufacturing offers good paying jobs to people across the income spectrum, and economists have long agreed that communities that have manufacturing jobs have less income stratification and provide more upward mobility for residents. Denver has been losing manufacturing space and has lost manufacturing jobs as a share of our total employment for many years. And that's in part because we've set aside fairly little plant, little room in our plans for these types of uses, but the demand for them is high. This amendment and the Pepsi project that this will support presents an opportunity for our entire community to add manufacturing employment here in the city and for our city to become a model for sustainable advanced manufacturing. And on a related point, second point, this plant amendment will support significant developments in sustainability and technology. Pepsi's proposed bottling facility is intended to be industry, leading both in its sustainability and its technology. On the sustainability front, the company is anticipating the use of solar energy to power the plant with a goal of the entire facility being net zero. It is anticipating electrification of the company's truck fleet in the hopefully relatively near future and using the most advanced technology for wastewater recovery and recycling in the entire industry and the technology front. The plant will feature automated storage and retrieval systems, automated guided vehicles and advanced diagnostics and beverage manufacturing. The third thing is that this has great has several community benefits for the far northeast community. Pepsi looks at community benefits through four major ways workforce development, educational partnerships, community partnerships, and infrastructure improvements and workforce. This project will provide community members with access to jobs and training. On the educational side, Pepsi is looking at partnerships with local high schools and community colleges to encourage building technical skills and the community side. Pepsi will continue with strong philanthropic support of community organizations citywide as well as in the far northeast area. And our infrastructure improvements will include streets and parks and recreational facilities for community use. So with that, we do encourage you to support this a plan amendment. We'll be happy to answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to go ahead and try to get Martin Wallace back in the queue, our final speaker for this public hearing. And I see you're unmuted. Martin, go ahead, please. I am. And sincere apologies. We have storms in New York. So happy to answer any questions. All right. Wonderful. Thank you. All right. That concludes our speakers for this hearing. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 358. CNN. I knew as soon as I saw that. Councilmember Flynn. Go ahead, please. Thank you, Madam President. It was taking a while after clicking the button for it to appear. The gentleman from the church. Mr. Benitez. Could you come up? I don't get out there very often. So I'm relying on Google which. Maybe isn't the best thing on the planet, but it appears that the church is like a commercial warehouse structure or some kind of a light industrial structure is. Are there plans to build a church structure somewhere nearby? Is this a temporary home for the church? To my knowledge, no. It's not a temporary home. They are an active church that I built out. It looks like a warehouse, but it honestly is a church on the inside. Similarly, it looks like a warehouse with respect to the high school. It looks like a warehouse. But when you walk inside, it is. A high school. Okay. So is this. This will be then the permanent home for Saint Gianna Beretta, Molla Parish. It is to my knowledge that they have signed a long term lease with me. Yes. And they are there and they're active, not just on Sundays at seven days a week. Okay. Generally speaking, the. Is this an archdiocesan church? Yes, it is. It's affiliated with the Denver Archdiocese. Yes, it is. It's not one of those sort of breakaway Pius the 10th. No. The lease is actually referenced in the Archdiocese of Denver for the benefit of. Okay. That's okay. Because generally the archdiocese owns the real estate where it's churches are built. So I'm just curious. That's why I was finding it hard to believe that this was the permanent location in many ways to sell this to the archdiocese. No plans right now. They lease part of one of the buildings, and they're a great tenant. Mm hmm. And part of why I'm here is because the 300 to 400 to 900 trucks are going to go within 55 feet of their back door. Okay. Thank you. Was that basically the the tenor of the remainder of your remarks that you were not able to make? I appreciate you asking that question because no, I actually had other remarks to make, and I'd be glad to supplement, if I may. Madam Chairman. Madam President, can I ask him that? Go ahead. Thank you for allowing me to do this. God forbid I should not panic. I say, God forbid. I should not. The reason that I'm suggesting that the council consider this issue of whether or not. This area plan amendment should be approved is for the simple reason that there was a decision made. There were options in front of the Department of Transportation, also in front of Pepsi Bottling Company, as to where all of these trucks and how they should go into and out of their facility. A decision not easy to make, but there were three options 69th Avenue, which abuts my property. 70th just north of it. And 71st. Just north of that. The decision ultimately made, to the best of my knowledge, after participating in the process and I filed objections or I filed our comments just as Pepsi did for the Denver Planning Board. But the decision was ultimately made without, to my knowledge, taken into consideration whether there was an impact on our building or on the hotels that are on 69th Avenue, those properties and the guests in those properties. There's going to be a lot of traffic no one has requested. We're asked whether or not this would impact our property at all. I have filed comments saying it will impact our property somewhere within the Department of Transportation, perhaps CPD. It's hard to say where the ultimate decision finally was made, but it was made to do it on 69th Avenue, which will severely impact the operations of my property . If the decision had been made after the city and county of Denver through its departments had actually. Gone in and understood. Is this going to impact you? Tell us what it will do. Having all these trucks every day. It's not just a NIMBY thing. It's this is what's going to impact our property. And I have 125 high school students and our high school. That are right there in DPS. I talked to them today. They are considering possibly expanding. There's a lot going on. But my point for the council to consider is that as this decision was made, it was made, I would characterize in a vacuum without having those of us, whether it's in an industrial site, whether it's a hotel, really talked to and allowed to voice their concerns. To me, it didn't happen. I wished it had. If the decision had been made, once that knowledge was shared, then I would accept the decision. I don't think it's there. I just do not think that process was undertaken. One of the things that I and I'm going to just say this is I truly, sincerely believe it. After 42 years here, many, many, many years that I've lived here, I have been thankful and very proud of this city and the state, quite frankly, of the decisions that we have made as a city and as a state . And what I'm challenging this city council is please. Please use best practices. Let us make the best decisions we can. We are smart. We can come up with solutions to issues and but let's hear people out and understand truly what impacts are. So I really appreciate the open question. Thank you. Thank you. That's all. Thank you, Madam President. All right. Thank you, Mr. Barnabas and Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sawyer. Thanks, Madam President. Just had a couple of, I guess, quick clarifying questions for CPD. So we haven't approved the amend the amendment yet and we haven't approved the rezoning yet. So those things have to happen legally speaking, before a site plan happens. Can we? In which case things like locations in and out. Of. And access to for trucks. Would. Be made. So I'm just a little confused about kind of where we are in the process in the background. Good evening, sir. My name is Steven Wilson. I'm with Community Planning and Development and in the large development review group. So I have worked with the applicant team and the different divisions in the city since the beginning of 2021 on this project. And to specifically answer your question, so there's a general development plan amendment and that has not yet been approved. That general development plan was presented to the Planning Board for feedback, and then the ultimate approval authority is the Development Review Committee. So you're correct that approval would be contingent on this evening's approval of the Area Plan Amendment and the rezoning. Okay, great. So, so the reason I ask that is because then that would suggest that there is still potentially time to, you know, discuss other options. Or. Consider. Impacts to surrounding businesses that maybe were unanticipated. That is correct. And if I may, I could give a little bit of background to that right now. So, again, thank you for the opportunity. So in the process of evaluating, there are actually four potential options at 69, 70, near 71st and 72nd. And through a process with Dottie community planning, development and the applicant in their plan, it was determined that 69th was the best option for safety reasons, that there is a streetlight already planned for 69. It allows for connections to the east. It allows for stacking of vehicles. And it again, it was overall the safest connection that we could do for the project based on the context. And to Mr. Benitez's point, there will be impacts to adjacent properties, but each of those other options has adjacent properties as well. Okay. And I think you mentioned, Brian, maybe you mentioned electrification of the the fleet. So. That could mean a lot of different things. Does that mean, then, that Pepsi's fleet will. Be quieter. And less impactful on the environment as a whole because they're electric? I mean, I used to have an electric car and people used to walk out in front of me all the time because they couldn't hear me coming. So I can attest to that. But I just wanted to kind of walk through that. I actually had a law school professor almost ran over me with an electric budget. Yeah, it's a thing. Yes. So if the if if the cab, you know, if you're an electric cab on the front of a truck, it's not going to have all the diesel noise that would come with a usual truck cab. There's still maybe noise from braking. There may still be, you know, noises associated with, you know, tire tires running along the pavement. But it would it would be quieter than a diesel cab. Okay. I really appreciate that. And I think that covers all my question. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Sawyer. Councilwoman Black. I'm just going to further clarify what Councilman Sawyer said. Whoa. Lily. By approving this amendment to the plan, are we approving that 69th Avenue will be the road that is accessed by the Pepsi trucks? So the the plan isn't the right tool for whether the 69th or 71st. In fact, the plan as you can. Well, I don't I can't share the screen now, but if I could, you'll see that the the deck there's no actual language in the plan that says 69th versus 71st or anything like that. It is graphical, it is diagrammatic in terms of sheer the potential connections that we can have. And then there's a legend there that's attached that says, you know what, one is a priority versus another one is as a second option. And so we facilitated that. There's a69 connection, and we also have an arrow that shows 71st connection as a potential potential network. So the. To to answer. You know, in order for this plan to be approved or in order for zoning rezoning to be approved, the plan is to be approved. But then it would kick in the GDP approval as well. Right. But by approving the plan amendment tonight, we are not approving the GDP. No, you're not. I just wanted to be clear on that. Thank you, Councilmember Black. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to ask how many lanes are anticipated on 69th Avenue? Is it anticipated to be widened from what it is today? Would. How many lanes are there right now? Again. Stephen Wilson, thank you for the question. So although I'm not an engineer, I think I have the answer to your question, which is that right away would ultimately support four lanes. To start with, I believe it will be two lanes with turn lanes that go with that. Okay. And that's a planner answering him or engineering questions. And how does that differ from 56th Avenue that runs in front of or is this GBR in front of the B Dennis campus? I believe it's 56th Avenue that runs in front of the Sandoval campus as well, which has a significant amount more of students in both of those campuses. Are you familiar with the the width of the roads in front of those two high schools? I apologize. I'm not. Okay. Councilwoman Gilmore, could you answer that question? So could you please your question again? I'm just asking, how many lanes of traffic are on 56th Avenue and is it GBR or 56 that runs in front of every Dennis campus? So it's Green Valley Ranch Boulevard runs perpendicular to every great Dennis campus. Telluride runs in front of it. But 15/6 Avenue is currently I mean, it's ultimately planned for six lanes, but we are getting an additional two lanes on 56th Avenue from Pena all the way to Peoria. So really the Montebello side in Green Valley Ranch, it's more so built out for the six lanes already on 56th Avenue. Okay. And that one is the one that runs parallel to the Sandoval campus. Right. Which has middle school and high school. Correct. I just wanted to sort of make that distinction between those locations, which I do know, on 56th Avenue between Pena Boulevard and Quebec Street, actually all the way down to I-25. As you go to the west, there's a lot of heavy truck traffic that travels on that particular corridor. That's normally the route I take when I come from the airport. So I don't have to, you know, sit with me. But I just wanted to point that out because I. Insensitive to Mr. Benitez's concerns. But as we have seen this part of our city grow, we have had to figure out how to address moving people back and forth, and particularly where we have some of the industrial businesses that happen to exist out in this area. So I think those are the only questions I had. So appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. And I'm going to go ahead and pose a couple of my questions and then we'll bring Councilman Flynn back into the queue. Lily. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. So when we had brought folks together for the far northeast area plan, we had great representation by both community organizations and residents in Green Valley Ranch . We got folks in Parkfield, High Point and Montebello. And could you talk a little bit about how we reconvened those steering committee members? Yeah. So we we had a fantastic steering committee that was really engaged in the original 2019 adoption process. And so we reached out to them again and we pulled community members from each one of those areas and asked them to rejoin. So we weren't starting that process from scratch. It wasn't people who, in terms of steering committee members who weren't involved in that in the original plan since this was so recently adopted, it felt like we just came back together and got back to work and really concentrated on the small area. So it was a really great process. Great. Thank you. And how many meetings? I know you talked about that. We had our kickoff meeting in October of last year. And could you talk a little bit about the attendance by committee, by steering committee members? And then we also had some wide scale public meetings as well. Could you talk a little bit more about the the participation and the conversation of folks? Yeah, well, certainly, given the fact that we are in a pandemic right now, the public meeting structure, which was previously done in in the Foreign Office, communities, community centers, high schools, and, you know, in a place where people really felt comfortable right. As part of their community, we this time around, we were meeting online. Right. And that was a completely different experience. We didn't get to connect in the same way in with the steering committee. We met twice. We exchanged a lot of emails back and forth, and one of the ways that I convinced everybody to come back together is I promised that I wasn't going to exhaust them with a lot of steering committee meetings. And so they were really engaged. They were really present. And then with the I think on average, we would get about 45 people showing up online. Again, that's that could be said, that's a lot in a COVID environment to an online participation, especially for an area that's, you know, there's no permanent residential community here. So it's all greenfields. Great. Thank you. And in those meetings with the community, I know a lot of times we talked about, you know, having a specific idea of what the truck routine would be so that there was consistency for community members. And so we talked about the free traffic scholarships and educational support that the community would want. Could you also talk a little bit about the workforce development and what was important to the community through having a large scale employer literally in the back yard, back yard or front yard of District 11? Yeah, we and that's one of the things that we reached out to the or we use the market analysis that we facilitated. Right. We weren't just thinking as we developed this with, with the community, but we weren't just thinking of Pepsi as the sole user like this. We anticipate similar type of in light industrial users like that facilitating. I wish I could pull the map up again because if you remember, it's hotel row along tower and greenfield sites all along. And so there's a lot of language that we included into the plan that spoke to building those partnerships, specifically with these kind of employment centers that are coming in, incorporating partnerships and creating neighborhood agreements that would foster those kind of, you know, relationships that we would we could anticipate the scholarships, we could anticipate job training. We could anticipate employing people from the community. Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate that, Lily, and your leadership through this process. And I would like to invite Mr. Benitez up for a couple of questions, please. Hello. Thank you for being here, sir. If you wouldn't mind what I. If I recalling which of the steering committee, the community meetings. Were you able to attend? I attended the February 24th of this year. Community meeting. Yes, I did. I attended and spoke at the Denver Planning Board. Hearing that consider this issue and we submitted comments to that. So, yes, I did do that. Okay, great. Thank you. So you were at one of the meetings and then you attended the planning board. From the the conversation with your high school, how long has the high school been located in this facility? They've been there approximately five years and they have about another four or five left. Okay. With renewals that are available. Great. And I know that in one of the meetings, we had talked quite extensively about the educational and also employment and career options that this might pose for students at your high school. And it sounded like from that meeting that it was something that you might be interested in pursuing, knowing that this far Northeast Amendment is separate from the rezoning hearing that we'll have after this. Great point. Let me let me add a comment. The company that owns this real estate. It's a small, limited liability company. We have seven members. We do not we do not object to the development that Pepsi wants to do. We're strong supporters of that. The objection that we have goes to one thing, and it is a decision that was made, and I don't know whether that decision was communicated during the other public hearings that Lilly described and perhaps you were referring to back in 21. And whether the attendees of those hearings truly understood there's going to be 300 to 400 to 600 to 900 trucks going on this particular street, because for the members of the council, there was a mobility study completed December 15th of last year. And that mobility study focused on 71st Avenue as the way to get the trucks in and out. And that mobility study concluded that that was the best route in and it did not address. 69th Avenue and decide the 69th was the best way in. That decision was made sometime in January or February or March this year. And it was made and I wonder whether that decision was truly communicated to members of the public particularly. The company I'm referring to be the Army. The hotels on 69th Avenue truly today understand that there's going to be this much traffic going by their hotels. And I question whether that that was truly made clear or not. So we do not object to the development. And should we support it? We support the jobs. Great, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. And then I don't know if this question is perhaps for Lilly, because when we were working with the community members, they did want something documented around. A. Truck reading agreement. And so the council office had worked closely before this rezoning was filed. That's right. To negotiate and to work with an adjacent property owner to assure that, because that was the recommendation from the members of the steering committee and community members, that they wanted a bit more reliability on removing trucks from Tower Road and actually rerouting those trucks onto Panya Boulevard more. So is that accurate? That's correct, yeah. So the good neighborhood agreement and the reason I didn't bring it up because these are usually not tied to the plan, the plans themselves, they're associate usually with the rezoning, which my my colleague Scott was going to refer to. But Brian, do you want to speak to the development agreement? Great. Thank you. And Brian, if you could, go ahead and introduce yourself for the record. Yes. Brian Connolly, again, I'm representing Pepsi Bottling Company, North America. So the agreement that you're referencing, Council President Gilmore, is a it's a truck routing agreement between Pepsi and the surrounding master association that controls all of High Point the development out there, because those are the most affected owners. Those are the ones that would be affected by truck routing and through the course of conversations. So so I want to just take one step back, which is the community meetings on this project actually started with the large development review process. So the community meetings actually started before the far Northeast Area Plan Amendment even was was discussed or came about. It started before the rezoning was was the application was filed. And in those community meetings we, we were required to notice properties all around the subject property. And so those notices went out to the entire hotel community up and down Tower Road. There were hotel owners that actually attended even that first community meeting on the large development review process. And one thing that we consistently heard was we don't want truck traffic going into the residential areas that are south of this property. As Lily mentioned, there is residential south of 64th Avenue. And so I think the feedback that we received from Green Valley Ranch, from Monticello, from people who live in the community, was we don't want truck traffic in our residential areas. Obviously, truck traffic in residential areas is also bad for Pepsi because that's certainly the slowest path by which you can transport goods out of the the proposed plant. So in working with the community immediately around this property, we we developed a truck routing agreement which provides for trucks to be routed west out of the facility to Tower Road, where they will then access Pena Boulevard and would actually then likely go on to E for 70. So so even keeping them sort of out of central Denver to the extent they're going westbound. So that's what the truck routing agreement provides and it's a binding contractual commitment. I would also just add the truck traffic piece. I would also just make one more clarifying point because I want to make sure we're operating on a consistent set of facts. There is no plan to have 900 trucks a day with this facility. This facility, as we've said consistently throughout the process, is anticipated when it when it opens to have approximately 12 trucks an hour, which comes out to about 280, 290 trucks per day. That number certainly could increase as production increases, but there is really no way that there would ever be 900 trucks a day. And I'm not really sure where Mr. Benitez got that information. Great. Thank you, Brian. Appreciate that. All right. That wraps up my questions for now. And we'll go it looks like Councilman Flynn, you're up next. Thank you, Madam President. You stole my thunder with the truck routing agreement. I was wanting to go into the background of why that was. That's not a city requirement. Lilly Correct. The truck routing agreement is in our packet and I was reading through it and I was just curious why 69th Avenue was chosen. I guess the city is not part of that, is it? Because it's between the High Point Master Association and Bottling Group? I'm not sure if I'm following your question. Does the did the city. Did we ask Pepsi and the. Joint. Master Association to come up with this truck routing agreement? We are not a party to it. That's right. So do we have anything to do with the do we ask for it? Well, we suggested that that might be the route to take. When we heard the the feedback from the community during planning meetings. Obviously we're not insisting on. No. Well. Or is this a disgusting thing? Brian, could you could you respond? I'm just really curious, because when Mr. Benedetti was talking about 71st Avenue, 71st Avenue was two blocks closer to Pioneer Boulevard, and it would mean two fewer blocks. My wife is not listening, so she can't correct my grammar. I think it's two fewer blocks traveling on Tower Road. Why? Why was 71st Avenue not chosen for this? I mean, because it goes right into the ACM High Point site. That it does actually. So 71st Avenue was the access point to the site that was initially proposed by Pepsi. Right. So if you can and again, if if we had the map up, it would be helpful. But if you can envision the geography out there, 71st Avenue and Oregon meet each other at what is essentially an L intersection. So 71st Avenue ends at Argonne right now. Right. The original proposal from Pepsi was to just extend 71st Avenue into the site that Pepsi is purchasing. Right. And feedback that we received from Dottie, we actually heard a few pieces of feedback from Dottie, which I think are important to this analysis. The first is that if if 71st were extended into the Pepsi site, you'd have a dead end street. We don't usually do dead end streets in Denver. It complicates things like snow removal and street maintenance and whatnot. Secondly, Dottie wanted a through connection to the East to improve connectivity in the area and so 69th allows for that. If you if you had 71st be that through connection through that property, you would you would basically preclude the construction of a manufacturing plant because it would be right in the middle of the property. The third reason that Dottie was concerned about that approach is that 71st Avenue, if it were used as the access point to the plant, it would result in trucks stacking or backing up westward from the plant entrance, which I mean, again, it's sort of anticipated that there would be 12 trucks an hour, a truck every five or 6 minutes. But if you had a stacking situation, the trucks might actually back up to the Tower Road intersection. The 69th Avenue alignment allows for a thru connection from High Point Boulevard over to Tower Road. It then also allows for what will ultimately be a long North-South driveway from 69th Avenue into the Pepsi facility so that you really don't run the risk of trucks stacking or backing up out under the public streets. Any of that stacking would occur internal to the property. And then the final reason, the fourth reason that Dottie, as I understand it, rejected the 71st Avenue proposal is that 71st Avenue, there is not enough stacking room for trucks that would be turning left off of Tower Road onto 74. So if you can imagine driving south from Panya Boulevard into where the hotel district is, you've got left hand turn lanes. There would not be enough room for trucks to to back up sort of backward north from 71st. And that would then impact the bridge that the bridge overpass where the line goes over Tower Road 69th Avenue, again allows for that through connectivity. It avoids the stacking issues. It will be a signalized intersection at Tower Road. And I'd also just point out that as part of the GDP amendment process, there is discussion about the applicant actually making transportation improvements to the intersections at 69th and Argonne, as well as at 69th and Tower Road to improve safety. Okay. Thank you. At. I guess I'm looking at the subdivision map and I. I just don't see I guess I don't see the sense of that. The 71st 69th Avenue being a thru route. Are we? We're going to punch it through to Aurora. Because it connects to High Point Boulevard at the Aurora city line. It would be no longer or shorter than 71st. So I'm a little befuddled. The left turn stacking cutout on Tower Road, it looks to be the same length turning left from tower to 71st as it is tower to 69th. So I guess I'm a little befuddled in the long run that this is not something that I would base, you know, a decision on. It's a it's an agreement between two private parties. It's not involving the city. But I just find befuddled by. So if you can shed light on it. Really, that's great. If not, we should move on. I just. Is there an option to share the screen? Again. Thank you so much. I just want to clarify to what Brian was speaking to. Here's the 69th Avenue connection. And these were really I mean, we spent hours and hours and hours with daddy trying to understand how to move traffic along here. Obviously, I'm not a traffic engineer either. I'm a planner. And so I'm going to do my best to explain and reiterate what Brian, which was speaking to you. But essentially what you get on 71st Avenue is a private roadway, right? That's just servicing Pepsi and Daddy's priority. One of their priorities was to make that through connection, that it wasn't going to be just in and out. But there was an opportunity to navigate traffic, not only for Pepsi to use, but for to connect across to what potentially would be 71st Avenue or 70 I'm sorry, 73rd Avenue across into Adams County as well. And then the intersection here, this is where Brian was speaking to you. The way that the the trucks lining up as they're coming down, pioneer would just cause too much of a congestion here and the ability to to make those left turns versus the ability to take a left turns here. And then again, as Steven Wilson mentioned, there's going to be a signaling that's going to be in place and that's already plan at 69. And that also created that as a priority over 71st. And lastly, the stacking of vehicles. This allows for the stacking vehicles, the length of that within Pepsi's property as they as they wrap as the trucks would wrap around here, which didn't didn't given just sort of the footprint and the layout of the building as proposed, which is very strict, as I as I learn, based on their operational needs, it wouldn't been a lot like they wouldn't have had enough room to do that on 71st. Okay. I. I guess I'm still scratching my head 69th as I'm looking I'm looking at that on my screen here and 69 Wiggles and whines to High Point Boulevard and then it goes up. I know that's Dunkirk. And then over again on 70th and then up on Himalaya, seems to be 71st, goes right into the plant and that would be where you want the trucks to go rather than winding through 69th and High Point. Yeah. And as Brian mentioned, that was that was our first and initial consideration. But it just no matter how much we tried it, it wasn't working. Okay, technically. Thank you, Madam President. Driven out there lately or had to go down Tower Road or once you get off Penn Yan Boulevard, it is a very short stretch of road and you could see very quickly how the trucks would start to stack up. That's right. Coming off and then impede traffic both on Tower Road. That's right in on Pena Boulevard as well, trying to get off on that off of that off ramp that definitely. I'm glad you're asking the questions. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Ortega. Thanks, Ben and President Lilly, I wanted to ask a question about you had mentioned that. Pitney Boulevard was one of the preferred routes to take to sort of keep that traffic out of the neighborhood. Mm hmm. And I don't know if we have anybody here from the airport. But I think we do. I remember we are going through a process of adding additional lanes because of concerns that traffic that's not going to the airport. We actually had to pay some fines to FAA because that road was built with airport dollars. And I'm just wondering how we're encouraging people to use Pinners that are not airport traffic. Right. That would would be using that corridor to then, you know, come into this area. And I get we want to keep traffic out of neighborhoods. But at the same time, I don't want to make I don't want to create more planes for the airport either. So is there anyone that can speak to this issue? I think Brian or Jen. I will I will do my best to answer it. And if I do something incorrect, then somebody behind me is going to kick me. So. We had discussions with the airport about the use of Panya and about the funding question and improvements to Panya. Ultimately, how those discussions were resolved is that because of the planning process that the city is going through right now, it was not the appropriate time to decide whether or how Pepsi or any other property owner along Panya would contribute to resolving that situation. The reality is that Panya was built with interchanges that serve the properties around it, and it's a public highway. And so that, you know, in working with through the airport and the city attorney's office, it was determined that this was the best approach to take with both truck routing and with addressing the issues of hand. So I think this is something that warrants having some input from the airport attorneys to make sure that we're not putting the airport in a in a box, if you will, as we encourage more and more development out in this area. I know it has been anticipated that we have airport development, and it may be that, you know, if this facility is going to be shipping out product to other cities, other states, it may be somehow deemed as an airport related operation. So that's where I think having that clarity from our our city attorneys from the airport may be helpful because I know that we don't want to get in trouble with FAA as as we've seen in the past, where we had to pay fines. And I'll go ahead and unless Brian. You I was gonna say I mean I've spoken to airport attorneys about this I don't know if any member of the city attorney's office who's present here would like to weigh in on it. But yeah, I did. I mean, so I've had extensive conversations with Josh in the mayor's office about this, and I'm blanking on Josh's name. Lepley Yes. And so, you know, in talking with Josh right now, we have traffic on Penna that is not sitting in county related, it is not airport related, it is commerce traffic. We're not currently it's not a toll road. We're not restricting Adams County, Arapahoe County Commerce City, Aurora from utilizing Pena Boulevard. And I would hate to see us restrict a large scale workforce development employment center in the far north east by holding ourselves to a different standard than what the airport is currently holding other municipalities to. And that hasn't been a conversation, I believe, that long ago when we explored the conversation about a toll road, we knew that that was going to restrict growth in the far northeast, and that wasn't anything that the airport wanted to do either. And so the airport has been well aware of this process as it's been going through, you know, the different channels. Are they going to come forward and publicly say, yes, we want you to do that? No, they're not. They're going to stay silent on it. But unless you've got new information that that's where we had left the conversation, I don't have near. And for me, I've just been struggling with trying to figure out how to answer your question. And I know I should have an answer. I was the transportation commissioner that involved in the project office, but I don't have the specific correct answer to your question. The more general answer to the question is that application. Of user fees have been evaluated for Pepsi Center, as you know, in. The for the for Pena Boulevard in general. But there isn't going to be a move to apply user fees for one specific user. So there could in the future be. A reevaluation of whether there. Should be user fees for for Penn. Boulevard. For all commercial uses or for commercial uses of a particular type. But the airport is not going to institute. Specific restrictions for one specific user. I get. That. Yeah. But I guess as we continue to encourage more development on airport property. It appears as though this is something that we're going to need to figure out how to tackle as as we attract more and more commercial or industrial development. I'm I think this is a great project for our city. I think it's a great project for the far northeast area. But I think we we just have to be really clear that, you know, we've we've crossed all the T's and dot it all the I's. And Shannon, I understand you have that. Expertize that you bring to the table. Having worked with CDOT and being involved with a lot of our big projects that we have in the city. But I just know that in the past we've had to pay fines because people driving on the airport on Pioneer Boulevard that were not going to the airport, we got dinged for it. We the airport. And so I just hope there's some way as as we encourage more development out there, that I heard you very loud and clear that there would be fees attached to the project. Is it you made reference to fees. That there are. Not user fees currently for the use of any boulevard. That there could be a general. Reevaluation of that in the future? The Chip Projects Office. Actually has a regular check in meeting with the airport administration to talk about sort of all the issues about real estate development. I will put that on the agenda for our next meeting, just to ask if, you know, if they're considering. This. In the future. I guess the other question to ask is, as we're moving forward to add more lanes of traffic to Pioneer Boulevard that. As I understood it would otherwise accommodate. Traffic that is not going to the airport. How? You know, like, what's the timing of that? And then how do we see that getting us out from, you know, being fined by FAA? So anyway, that would be part of those conversations with the mayor's office. But I appreciate everyone attempting to answer my questions. Thank you. Sorry, I can't be more specific. Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, for those questions. And I hope we get to that point that we have more development in the far northeast, that we have to entertain some of those fees for the use of our roadways. That would be great. Not seen any other questions. The word we're within our meeting right now, sir, and the public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 352. I want to go ahead and I'll make my comments first about that. This is in the far northeast and this has been a long time coming. We had great community engagement with the Far Northeast plan when we went through that initial process. We reconvened the same community members because they were very well versed in what the far northeast area plan and the intent was. And we reconvened those co-chairs and they did a really great job of through Montebello 2020, through Montebello Organizing Committee, through Girls Trek, through Montebello, walks through the Green Valley Ranch Citizens Advisory Board, through a variety of civic minded and community based organizations, came together and really made recommendations that we held Pepsi to a high standard. We held the the potential use. We vetted all of the different options and talked through it with the community. And we wanted to be cognizant that we didn't want truck traffic going through the residential areas. Now, do schools change do churches change locations? Yes, they do. We know in Denver public schools that they're currently closing schools because they're not seeing the enrollment numbers that they used to have. And I would ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this far Northeast Amendment, because it will bring almost 500 high paying jobs to the district. And we have a plan in place to reduce the negative effects of that development in the community. And I would ask my colleagues to support this far northeast area plan amendment this evening. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22. Council members say to Barker, You're a little late on the queue, but go ahead and get your comments in, please. Thank you very much. I am currently housing Pepsi in my district and currently live in a neighborhood surrounded by these job providers like Purina, Manna, Pro and Pepsi and Coke. And the list goes on of people or companies that we've sacrificed our communities to. This is it feels incomplete. It feels like we're prioritizing the business over. The bike impaired experience in these neighborhoods, the residential experience. I have a camera outside my home that captures how many semi-trucks go down my street. They're not allowed to go down. And every day I count hundreds of them. And so I'm very concerned about this and definitely don't think we have enough information about the agreements, about the stakeholders who are affected at the schools in this location. And so for tonight, I'll have to abstain, but wanted to make sure that I explained on record why I don't feel like this is complete and why I feel like there is potential harm or unintended consequences of not fully fleshing this out before we support it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman CdeBaca. And I'll go ahead and close out the comments. I'm going to tonight vote on my vote with my community and that there is no residential community of Denver residents in the area. And I'm carrying forward the will of the district 11 residents who fully vetted this process. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 22, Dash 352, please. Black. I set about to abstain. Clark. I.

I've got the annual numbers right here, Councilman. Great. We'll start with CDBG. Last year, CDBG was 6,531,000. This year at 6 million 602. So it's actually up just a slight bit. Keep in mind, however, that the historic trend has been significantly. Down. From 2011. We're down about 17%. On the home funds, which are exclusively, of course, for housing. Last year's numbers were 2 million 363 638. This year's numbers are 2 million 362 617. So down very slightly, a few nickels and dimes. But again, for historical. Context. Since 2011, the home funds are down 38%. And lastly on Hopper, a little bit more encouraging news. Those numbers are much more stable. It's a relatively small grant. Last year was 1 million 562 737. This year it's 1,000,007, 86, 90. So it's actually up 12% this year. All right. So thank you for that information. You're welcome to sort of be aware of how the funding has changed over time.

An Ordinance relating to a Public Safety Bill of Rights for the Seattle public. Remembering Subchapter Six as Subchapter Five and creating a new subchapter six. In Chapter 3.28 of the Seattle Municipal Code, the committee recommends a bill passed as amended. Thank you, Councilmember Herbal. Thank you. The Observer Bill of Rights passed out of Committee four zero week before last, and I introduced it. We heard it first, last in August, and there was a lot of work that needed to be done between our first hearing of the bill and our committee vote a week before last. But in a nutshell, the bill was introduced in recognition that observation of police activity has always been an important element of police accountability. Here in Seattle, Mothers for Account Mothers for Accountability has for decades trained community observers to watch the actions of police in detaining suspects. The majority of police interactions with the public are fair and professional, but the observation of police actions is just one way to reduce the chances that people are treated unfairly in their interactions with police. And, you know, when people are not treated fairly or force is used inappropriately, observation ensures that there's a witness today. Actual recording of observed police activity is an element of accountability that is growing in importance. The bill itself would establish that by law, the public has the right to observe police activity consistent with existing police department policy. It states that officers may not use physical force to punish or retaliate against observers and must seek to minimize harm to bystanders when using less lethal tools like pepper spray or tear gas. In addition, if a person brings a claim the law was violated, the Office of Professional Accountability must be notified. Across the country, recordings of police activity by the police have increased the public's ability to hold police accountable. However, sometimes this has led to arrests, which have in turn have generated First Amendment legal challenges to these arrests. Here in Seattle, the auditor in 2008 reviewed police incidents where people were arrested and charged with obstruction only and without any other charge. Resulting one third of the cases involved arrests of bystanders, and over half of these were African-American. That that study in 2008 was when I first became interested in this issue subsequently two that the Washington State Supreme Court recognized the First Amendment right of the public to observe and criticize law enforcement in the case of the state of Washington versus E.J. in Seattle. In the case Seattle officers had responded to a call about a fight between the complainant, sister and mother. There was a heated verbal exchange between the officers, and. E.J. refused to leave the. Open doorway of the house and closed the door because he was observing the interaction. He was a 17 year old black man. He was arrested for obstructing a law enforcement officer. Laws like this have been passed in other states, including California, Oregon and Colorado. And at a time when we have an increasing reliance on cameras that police officers wear or have in their cars, I believe we need to remind the public that the police activity that they observe is still important. A Washington Post article from March noted that in a shooting of an A in a shooting in Albuquerque, there were seven body cameras present. The camera of the police officer who fired the shot. Was it recording three missed the crucial moment and three were either blurred or contained. No record. So in this time of moving towards more reliance on police worn cameras, I think the public statement that the the observations of members of the public in the recordings of the members of public are not only important to police accountability, but the rights of individuals engaging in in that activity will be observed. By the city of Seattle. Thank you. Questions or comments? Please call the role on the passage of the bill. Gonzales. I. Herbold, i. JOHNSON Whereas I. O'BRIEN Hi, Sergeant Bagshaw. BURGESS Hi, Aiden.

Thank you, Councilman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Chief, I was hoping that you can give us an update on the positions that we already have budgeted that remain vacant for traffic enforcement. And speak to a little bit about where we are with our traffic enforcement team and your efforts to build that back up. Because obviously, as you know and I know all of my council colleagues know traffic enforcement and traffic safety is a huge, huge issue citywide. It affects every single district and every single resident. So I'd love to have an update about where we are and how we're going to fill these positions that are funded but vacant. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. So can you give an overview of the budgeted numbers? And as I mentioned earlier on the other topic, historically we don't have definitive actual numbers because of injuries and deployments and that type of thing. So that's just that, the caveat to that. But we are budgeted for 24 years to our motor unit. We were budgeted for two sergeants to our motor unit. We currently have six available motor officers and one available sergeant. So we have officers who are either out on injuries or have been deployed within those numbers. But we have vacancies that we need to fill in. A big part of filling those vacancies involves recruitment and retention and the ability to hire more police officers so we can get them trained and deployed and allow opportunities for existing officers to go to those motor units. So that's what we're working on right now to address the traffic enforcement issues. Okay. So the the reason I think that this item is timely is, as we just heard, the city manager has presented his budget to the mayor for review. And I know that these positions, it looks like we have 14 positions that we could potentially fill for our traffic enforcement unit that are budgeted already. Those dollars are in the budget. So I want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to retain existing officers, the existing six that we have. But also, if we're able to offer any sort of a recruitment or signing bonus to hire for those 14 positions that we have open, is that something that's contemplated in the budget? And if not, is that something that the city manager can look towards, including. So Councilwoman, I can talk about what exists now and motor officers do receive additional pay for that assignment. As far as I'll ask Mr. Modica, regarding the budget discussion and the ability to include that within the budget. So we can do the same thing. On the other item, we can bring back some suggestions on how to get to where the council wants to go on this. We do have the ability to do hiring bonuses. That was something that we just got through. I mean, confer and the council very much supported. So we can certainly look at making sure we have enough officers in our upcoming class. We are doing back to back to back academies. So we have one coming on in August and then we'll be following up right after that with another one and one after that. So the plan is to get stepped up and if we need to use bonuses to be able to bring officers in. What we don't have right now is a program to pay people to stay in a certain slot or position that they're currently in our programs or to attract new individuals into the city. Okay. Well, I think that having some sort of a retention bonus, our retention option is really important for our traffic officers. How many diaries do we have in the agency right now? Councilwoman We currently have six certified diaries with, I believe, one in the process of being certified in two additional officers that are scheduled for training and certification for the degree program. Okay. One of the things I would like to suggest, and I know we're going through negotiations and I think this is something I've talked about it in the past, but I would like to see us consider a stipend for degrees. Certified degrees. I mean, we've we saw so many traffic fatalities last year. I think they were on pace with the number of non traffic murders that we saw in on traffic fatalities, that the numbers were incredibly high. And I want to see to make sure that our traffic enforcement team, our motor unit, is built back up. Six officers is not enough to serve a city of this size with one sergeant. And of course, having six certified degrees is great. But given the increase we're seeing in impaired driving, that includes combination cases of drugs and alcohol. I think it's important that we invest in more degrees. And if that involves giving the degrees a stipend as part of their contract, I think that's something we should be open to considering. But I'd ask my colleagues to support this item. Again, it's it's it's doing everything we can to fill the current vacancies that we have so that we can build our traffic enforcement team, our motor unit back up. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. Thank you. While this is supercritical critical, I want to say that it's even more critical that it's really up and running as soon as the funds are available. I know back to school time is a critical time for our community and our traffic issues. Youth crossing the street and the condition of our roads these days, people are just not paying attention. And the number one thing that I know comes up at our side of town community meetings is not just the petty theft, but the other number one idea that's very co-leaders in the fight is really the traffic issues in our city and how we've worked really hard with the traffic engineer to design changes that that make that difference. But until we're out there enforcing the law on a regular basis, we just don't have the compliance that we really need from both anyone driving in our city. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Sir. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Councilmember Price, for bringing this item forward. I think we've talked about traffic as well as pedestrian safety quite a number of time in our public safety committee. And while I do agree that we do need enforcement, we've also talk about doing education. So we do prevention around various impaired driving to making sure that our roads are safer by working with public works, to ensuring that we're just getting people to slow down and not drive so fast as well as on our Health and Human Services Department side. And how are we making sure to educate pedestrians as drivers about how best to walk or proceed accordingly? And also in the end, it's reducing just collisions and injury. So it's taking a less told our not our fire department as well. So I just wanted to make sure to acknowledge that, that while I do think we do need enforcement, we also need kind of a collaborative effort with our other departments, too. And so I think that we also have received some grants recently around doing education as well. Right, Chief? Yes, Councilwoman. We have the OTS grant where some of that funding goes to not only the police department, but the health department to provide educational campaigns and efforts for the community. How much was that? I don't have the exact funding number, but I can report back on that for you. Thank you. Thank you. Come from Boston. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And I'm happy to second this motion. Obviously, we have a mission as a city to be a Vision zero city and reduce traffic fatalities and accidents across our city. But these are daily realities that we deal with in our communities. And there are major corridors that impact many people, particularly pedestrians and businesses. So I'm happy to support this as I want to be consistent and just make a friendly request to the maker of the motion to allow us to to look at this a little closer to the budget oversight process. That is the appropriate place for this item to be. We're talking this close to the budget season, and I think it's important for us to, you know, really, really dig in, see process and look at these proposals. And so I'm happy to support this. This is headed in the right direction. It's good to hear the data, but like I said, I'd like to get into it a little deeper in terms of understanding personnel numbers and and, you know, how we can we can we can help improve traffic enforcement in the city of Long Beach. I can tell you that I am already prepared for the first week of school. Right, for school year. Usually, you know, there's a dramatic demand for traffic enforcement around our schools, in our neighborhoods. That never changes year after year after year. So obviously, I like to be in a position to move an item, but also be in a position to to be prepared for the demand that we're going to have during the school season, school year, because there is opportunity as number provision to educate parents, educate the public about, you know, the hazards of driving behavior, particularly in school zones. So I'm happy to support this and hope to see a further Barbie AOC. Thank you. That concludes your public comment. I'm sorry on this item. If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on item 38 in person, please sign up at the podium in Zoom. Please use the race cam feature or dial star nine. See none. That concludes public comment. Thank you. There is a motion and I just want to clarify that. I know that he he queued on hybrid, but Councilor Austin wanted to be the second to the motion councilman Mongo. Okay, so the motion and a second member's piece couldn't catch your votes. The Mayor I had some questions as well. I cued up. You're. I'm so. I'm sorry. You're right. You did keep up, and I'd have you on here, so call Councilman Allen. All right? No worries. No worries. I know it's tough with this hybrid. And so I'm. Thank you, Mayor. And again, I support this full valley. Wholeheartedly support this. I think this is great. I do have a question, Chief, if you were there. So Councilwoman Pryce brought up the the drugs. And so I have a question regarding that myself being a former degree. And I know how much time and effort goes into that. Is there a need for us to do that anymore? And the reason I'm asking that is, you know, we don't really prosecute for 1150 anymore. I mean, drugs have pretty much been decriminalized. So is the juice of a of a degree even worth, you know, the squeeze on our budget? So I just I know we need them for maybe felony DUIs, but is that necessary as we beef up the traffic division to actually have certified drugs? So. Thank you, Councilwoman. The DRC training is essential and it's important. And the reason being is that, you know what you're referring to for the 1155, those are under the influence, although that might not be the primary mission of a drug recognition expert. And even with the changes in legislation, driving under the influence is still an issue. And so having a drug that can recognize when substances beyond just alcohol are on board with a driver involved in a traffic collision or a fatality is very important. So it is additional training that just enhances an officer's ability to address impaired driving. Okay. So are you using then diaries and sorry, because I've been gone for so long. I'm just. Just. Are you using drugs? Do they go to respond to all traffic collisions or is that just depending on availability? So thank you, Councilwoman. That's depending on availability. If they are available, they they are called for and respond. However, officers are still able to articulate symptoms and symptomology to make arrests related to impaired driving, even if they are not diaries. The DRI program just provides an enhanced level of training and certification that helps with the prosecution. Okay, good. So so these programs, which are like traffic programs all throughout the city, are really important, I think, to everyone in every district. So this would still be beefed up regardless of DUI certifications, is that correct? I'm sorry, Councilwoman. I don't know if I understand the question correctly. The dairy program would still be increased. Is that what you're talking? Yes. I mean, we're we're still going to increase, but. But is the beefing up? Yes. The traffic division. Is that dependent on getting those officers certified? No, ma'am. That those are the traffic vacancies that I currently have that I would like to fill. Okay, great. Okay. Thank you so much, Chief. I appreciate all your good work. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Councilman Fischer. Thank you. You're quite up again, correct? Yes. It's just real quick. So I love the questions that Councilman Allen asked. So spot on. Right now, the only way that we can prosecute the misdemeanor DUI offense is a vehicle code sections 23, 152, C, D, E and S. Those are the drug or combo DUIs. They're misdemeanor offenses. So the drugs are really necessary to prosecute those cases because in California, there's no per se level of impairment like there is with alcohol at a point. There's no four sigma level for drugs. So the only expert that can come to court and opine that someone was impaired for the purposes of driving really is a degree and the chief is right. Other officers can opine, but the testimony of a degree in court in terms of whether drugs were a factor or a combination factor in someone's impairment, can really only be done by a degree. That's why the California Office of Traffic Safety, OTS, provides so many different grants related to drugs. And that's why CHP has really been trying to push a DRP stipend for different agencies. And CHP is willing to assist law enforcement agencies with that kind of a stipend because we saw a huge increase in DUI drug cases from DUI alcohol cases since the passage of Prop 64 and some other legislation that changed the number of DUI cases that we had that were either combination or drugs only. So drugs are huge. And the item that I brought specifically talks not just about DUIs, but street takeovers, loud pipes and speeding and running of spot stoplights stop lights and stop signs. So the traffic enforcement team hopefully can address all of those things. DUIs were just one of the items that I enumerated in my item. And and to Councilman Austin's point, yes, absolutely. They should come back to The O.C. for further discussion. But I just want to highlight that my item tonight talks about existing budgeted positions, not budgeting more. So thank you. Thank you. We are going to go ahead and go to a vote. Let me let me just two announcements here. We go to a vote. The city one city attorney has asked me just to remind folks to keep their cameras on just for the council rules. I mean, we're doing the remote. And then secondly, Vice Mayor Richardson believes this anniversary tonight. So he wanted to make sure that we announce that he was he had headed out for his wedding anniversary. And then Mr. City attorney, the director of the announcement. Right. Okay. Thank you. There's been a motion and a second members. Fusco and Castro votes. We'll call District one. District to you. I disagree. I. District five. I. District six i. District seven i. District eight II. District nine. Motion is carried. Thank you.

Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Black, will you please put council bills? 33, 85 and four or 542 on the floor. Sorry about that. Yes, I move that council bills 385 and 542 be ordered published in a block. All right. It has been moved. I need a second. Great. It has been moved in. Segment questions coming from members of Council Council on assessment. Thank you, Mr. President. The administration has asked that these two bills be voted down. Concerning Council Bill 385, it's a partnership with urban drainage and flood control, and funding comes from a variety of sources, including federal grants, cost sharing, cost sharing with urban drainage and city funds. But the numbers in the actual ordinance aren't the correct ones. And so they wish we would need to vote this down tonight, and then they would refile it with the correct numbers at another time. At the same as the IS refers to the Council Bill 542. It again is a partnership with urban drainage and the funding comes from a variety of sources and they have most of it correct, except they don't have the actual the correct numbers for Denver's piece of the project. So I'm asking my fellow council people to vote these down as a block. Okay. Councilman Ortega. I just want to remind you all that we have shortened our process to expedite the contracts. So we we gave up one week of us being able to look at contracts. We now call them resolutions. And so we get to see them for for a whole week. And, you know, typically the agencies have months and months and months that they work on things. They get filed. We get the details the Thursday before the Monday night meeting, and sometimes the details are always there. I did not support that change. And this is just one more example of us being expected to you know, I get that we want to make sure we got accurate information and that is important. But I am concerned that there was so much to do made about the contracting process and the need to make the change on our end. And we're the ones that had the least amount of time to get to review them. And I'm just expressing, I guess, just frustration in the process and how it works. So I just couldn't let it pass without saying that. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Espinosa. Wow. My thoughts? Exactly, Councilwoman Ortega. So I just. Not that I need to spell this out, but this is precisely what I was talking about in my comments about we don't vote these things down unless the administration tells us. So, yeah, I will be rubberstamping this request from the administration. Yeah. Despite what we're saying that we don't do because it's going it's at least getting us. It's going to come back in the Q and I would like to have ample amount of time to review the final product. Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm just unclear as to what is. What are the bad numbers? Those are the dollar amounts, and. They're incorrect numbers. The dollar amounts. There's there is somebody in the audience that could speak to it, if you'd like. Yeah, that'd be great. I'd be interested to hear where the problem is. Thomas Blackman or John McGrath. Hi. My name is Thomas Blackman. I'm an engineer supervisor in public works. So the the numbers in the agreements are correct. But they're we wanted to make sure that we represented the contractual obligations of the city. It wasn't clear in this summary. So that's why we wanted to redo this summary to to represent the numbers so you could see the actual contractual obligations of the city. And Kay. There were a. Lot confused me even more so. I'll definitely support a little more time. There is no and I shouldn't read this as any indication that we're not supporting the deal itself. It's just details. Yes. Is that correct? Yes. We when we put together the information. We were more focused on urban drainage. His contribution to the two projects versus the city's obligation that we are. We are going to Sanderson Gulch, for example. Urban drainage is putting $1,000,000 towards the project, and that's the primary primary purpose of this amendment. But we do have to put in the total project costs. So we want to make sure that the Council is aware that we are committing the city per this amendment to $7 million, which is going to be you guys looked at the grants that are coming from federal governments are going to cover that portion. But when would you expect to refile this? We are short order. Yeah. Where are you going? To read. Redo him. Work with John McGrath in the Attorney's Office and make sure that we represent. Just so that's very clear on what the city is committed to. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilman Cashman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. I suppose we could send a message to the administration by approving this over their objection. But I'll. I'll. I'll refrain from suggesting that in lieu of perhaps 30 more seconds, explaining what it is in the language that was submitted, that is at fault. Yeah. I'm John McGrath, the city attorney. So. There are two of them. And I'll describe sort of overall what the issue is, and then we can get okay with each of them. But Sanderson Gulch is one of the two, and what happened is that these are somewhat complicated funding agreements where two or in some cases three different governmental entities are contributing funds to a project. These are projects that were already in existence and are sort of moving on to the next phase where additional funding is coming in. So what happened is in the original bill request, all of that detailed information was laid out. But somewhere in the process between there and coming up with the short blurb that you see in the agenda, information was omitted. So the description in the agenda is accurate but not complete. Okay. Information was omitted. And so we're not really under the underlying contracts aren't changing. It's just that we wanted to make sure that council and the public have the opportunity to see what's actually happening. That's the whole picture. That's good. In other words, the contract that was filed that we have in the system here is not changing. It's not change. It's just the way we're describing it here. Thank you. That's very good. I appreciate that. Okay. Councilwoman Ortega, do. You just. I just wanted to ask, you mentioned something about $7 million is the that's the remainder of the total cost. Is all of that coming in grant funding or is there additional general fund money that needs to sort of fill that gap? We are we are receiving grant funds from who are receiving each MGP grant from the feds and CDBG grant from the state. That's going to cover the majority of that. And then anything else, we're currently in design and working on cost estimates and everything else would would have to be come from Wastewater Wastewater Enterprise Fund. Okay. And the did want to see these are going on ordinance. Hold on real quick. Uh, David Brower is the city attorney. David Bravo, Assistant City Attorney. Let me just add this clarification for everybody's benefit to this is not an example of where the fix is just going to be coming back with a new bill next week. It's because the bill. Request needs. To be. Corrected and clarified. So you all will see this. As a new bill request that you'll have the opportunity to ask questions about pull off consent or or having a committee or consent process. So I just want to be clear about that. This is just going to be refiled next week. It's going all the way back to a new and clarified bill request to jive with the proper what should have been the proper description of the contract. So just know that that's what that's what's going to play out next. Great. Thank you, Dave. Mr. Broadwell. Well, Councilwoman Ortega, do you have another question? I was just clarifying whether or not, you know, there were additional there would be additional hits to the city budget if that wasn't covered by the grants. And I think you you clarified clarified it. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa, are you back up? No. Okay, great. It's been moved. And secondly, you guys can have a seat. Thanks for coming up. It's moved and seconded. The committee and the administration has asked us to vote this down, obviously to be refiled. So. 385 Madam Secretary, roll call. It also includes 542 and 542. Thank you. What will we do without you? Assessment? No. Black? No. Espinosa. Flynn? No. Gilmore? No. Herndon? No. Cashman? No. Kenny Lopez? No. New Ortega? No. Mr. President. No. I'm sorry. I was just proven to counsel Councilman Espinosa. It wasn't a, uh. Anyway, please close the voting. Announce the results. Zero ice, 12 nays. Zero ise, 12 nays comfortable. 385 and 542 have been killed. All right. Let's see. Are we. Are we done, Madam Secretary? Yes, Mr. President. Okay, great. All other bills for introductions are order published. We are now ready for the black vote on resolutions and bills for front of consideration. Council members remember this is a consent or bloc vote and you will need to vote. Otherwise, this is your last chance to call an item for a separate vote. Councilwoman Black, will you put the resolutions for adoption and bills for final consideration for final passage on the floor? Yes, I move that resolutions be adopted in bills and final consideration be placed upon final consideration and do pass in a block for the following items. 17 Dash 055205530554055505560557055805600561057705790588058905900591059204610471053405800583058505860291056205660569058105820390057205310530053205360537.

Expressing concerns for the Northwest testing and training proposal of the United States Department of the Navy for Puget Sound, coastal waters from Northern California through Washington State and for Alaska. The committee recommends the resolution be adopted. Customer Brian. Thank you. So the Navy is considering additional tests of their sonar and explosive devices in the waters off Puget Sound and up and down the coast. As the bill describes as part of that proposal, they've been required to do a supplemental environmental impact statement. I believe no is actually conducted. And through that, what we've seen is that the work they're proposing to do would have significant impacts on marine mammals who use various methods for navigating and communicating, including the orca population in Puget Sound. We know that the massive amounts of sonar that can potentially be put in water or explosives have had sometimes debilitating and occasionally life threatening impacts on these marine mammals. And this resolution asks the Navy to reconsider their proposal in light of the science and come back with some ideas of how they can conduct their tests in a way that sensitive to the population, particularly highlighting the plight of the orcas in Puget Sound. The reality is that those three pods that make their home in Puget Sound waters and the Greater Salish Sea are on the brink of extinction, and the death of just one or two of them could jeopardize their ability to sustain those populations . Also, we will be sharing this with our federal delegation as my colleagues and others, to highlight this for our federal delegation so that they can have a similar conversation with the Navy to try to adjust their proposal. Thank you, Councilmember O'Brien. Any other questions or comments on the resolution? Or the orchestra? No. No closing words. Okay.

Next item is item number 13, please. Communication from Councilwoman Price. Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilwoman Allen. Recommendation to evaluate the feasibility of including a third party vendor as part of the future electric scooter program. Agreements with operators. Thank you, Councilman Price. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So scooters being deposited all throughout our district continues to be a major problem in the third district. And I appreciate our mobility team with whom I've had an opportunity to speak about this issue. It appears that council districts one, two and three are the ones that are primarily impacted by this problem. Scooters are dropped off in roundabouts in the middle of landscaping. They're dropped off in the middle of the street. They're dropped off on the bike path at the beach. They're dropped off on sidewalks, making it nearly impossible for ADA accessibility. And it's just not okay. And this was one of the concerns that was raised when we entered into our contracts with the scooter companies. We were assured that there would be mechanisms and technology in place to make sure that this debris isn't deposited all over the city, or at least in the three districts that are the primary users of these these technologies. And unfortunately, it just it continues to be a problem. So I'm hoping that city staff can explore the feasibility of putting into the new contracts a third party vendor that can assist the scooter companies, who clearly appear to be overwhelmed with the fundamental responsibility of making sure dump scooters are picked up, and that clearly they're not able to meet that burden that they committed to meeting. So perhaps working with a third party might assist them in fulfilling that obligation and commitment to the city that they have made as part of their contract. And hopefully that is an alternative that can be made available to the scooter companies to ensure mitigated quality of life impacts for our residents and certainly mitigated accessibility issues for our residents who are operating on the sidewalks, in wheelchairs. And I ask for my colleagues support on this. Thank you, Councilman Allen. Thank you, Mayor. And thank you, Councilwoman Price, for bringing this item forward. I too regularly hear from my residents and city CD2 about the issues of having the scooters parked and laying against the ride away. I'm concerned about the impacts. Also with disabilities, people with strollers. I've seen the UPS guy have to pick them up. I mean, this is just a roll, a real issue. I'm also excited to hear from staff about my prior request to incorporate the SCOOTER compliance into our excellent Go on Beach app. So thank you very much and I'll be supporting this. Thank you, Councilman. And they have. Thank you, Mayor, and thank you very much, Councilmember Price, for bringing this forward. This is very, very important to me as well. And as a councilwoman, it is not only on, you know, my goal to make our transportation options more accessible to all, but also in expanding and redefining what safe, reliable, agreeable public transportation can look like in our city. I am a huge supporter of the Shared Micromobility program because it gives us the opportunity to create more transportation options that are not only good for the environment, but that are also convenient for residents as well. However, we still have a long way to go on this, so I am very thankful for this item and for us to be able to look at this and find a better word, a better way to work together and really include different kinds of programs in. And having a third party company come in and help us out, I think would be very, very efficient and very good for all of us. I would also like to when we're doing this may be that our we take a good look at what kind of third party companies are out there and really try to seek out companies that bring us the most to our city.

Recommendation to receive and filed the fact finding report issued by the fact finding panel as part of the impact process and adopt resolution authorizing implementations of the terms of the city's last, best and final offer to the IAM. Regarding the Long Beach Civic Center Project City Cape. Mr. West or Mr. City Attorney, I'm not sure who's doing that. Mr. WEST. Yes, I'm going to introduce our H.R. director, Alex Vasquez, who's going to give this report with support from our legal counsel, Ed Moyes. Thanks. Honorable Mayor and members of city council. The city determined that. That substantial renovations were needed for. The new City Hall. Main Library and other public facilities. Given the substantial. Costs of renovating these city facilities. The city opted to explore private public partnership to finance. The. Construction of the new civic center. The city selected plenary as its development partner. During negotiations with plenary. The city learned that Plenary required a subcontractor to perform various security, maintenance and operational services, which are currently performed by city employees. The city had determined that this model was most cost effective to ensure that the city would. Obtain a building. In like new. Condition over the term of its use. As a result of this proposal. As I indicated, city employees would no longer perform these custodial. Maintenance of supplemental security work. When the new civic center would be completed in 2019, the city had engaged in the process with I and the management Labor representatives over the proposed positions that would be contracted out. The Long Beach Management Association bargaining unit. Did not object to the city's proposal. The city engaged in meet confer process with I am and negotiated in good faith. However, we were not able to reach an agreement with IAM over contracting out the 11.97 FTE Iam representing employees. We had been negotiating with IBM since September of 2015 over contracting out. This bargaining unit work. After several months of negotiations. And an exchange of proposals, the city and an. Imam are now at impasse. The city presented its last, best final offer to I am on February 17th. Upon I am's rejection of the city's last best final offer. The city declared impasse and provided a written notification to IAM on February 26. As part of the public. Sector negotiation process. Once the. Impasse has been declared, unions have the option. To request fact finding before an agency can impose its last, best final offer. AM did in fact request fact. Finding on March 22nd. And the fact finding hearing was held on April 15th. The fact finding report. Was issued on May 9th, and it's attached to the counsel letter in Exhibit B. The fact finding process is advisory only, and it's basically an extension of the mean confer process and the fact finder attempts to assist the parties to reach a compromise. The Council retains the ability to make a final decision on the contracting out decision. And as such, the City Council is not obligated to accept or reject, but simply consider the recommendations. Its staff's recommendation that the Council receive and file the Fact Finders Families Panel's report and adopt a resolution authorizing the implementation of the terms of the city's last best final offer. In summary, the fact finder. Found that the city should. Move forward or recommend that the city move forward with contracting out certain positions. Specifically the. Building maintenance, the building services supervisor, the facilities administration management positions. And the fact finder also found that the city should not contract out the. Maintenance assistance, which is the custodial. Positions, and instead that the city should. Enter an agreement with. The union over allowing a. Contractor employee supervise and manage the city. Unionized employees. In addition, the fact finder also recommended that the city should. Not contract out the additional security positions. As we've indicated. Staff is recommending that the city council. Impose its last, best final offer. And basically the terms of the last, best final offer. Include the following basically a city commitment to continue to meet the mean confer process over any unforeseen impacts. And continue. To confer process. Prior to the occupancy in 2019 that the city would. Contract out the 11.97 FTE. And the positions would be restored back upon. Hand, back of the Civic Center, that no employees would be laid. Off or there would be no reduction in classification hours. Or pay for those employees that are impacted. And that the city would. Agree to preserve the existing security services and only contract out two additional security positions that would provide. Supplemental security work. The city had asked that we also have a provision. And that indicates that the city agrees not to contract out any other. I am represented bargaining unit work and that the city would take an action to effectuate these provisions. At this point, if there's any questions, we'd be happy to answer any questions. What we're recommending is, again, that the counsel received and filed a fact finding report and adopt a resolution authorizing the implementation of the last, best final offer. Mayor Councilmembers. I just want to reiterate the recommendation that our H.R. director just gave. I do want to point out to you that our initial compromise some time ago was to take the six security officers that we're proposing a contract out and not contract them out. We put that on the table and did that quite some time ago at a cost of about $450,000 a year to the city. In addition to that, we have made adamant. We've plans that no employees are going to be laid off, lose hours, lose classification. So that's in there. And the city council has been on record saying that as well as the city manager and H.R. team. So with that, we recommend you receive and file the Fact Finders report and adopt the resolution. Thank you very much. Okay. There's a motion in a second. Public comment, please. Good evening. The city manager is taking the city further down the wrong path. Remember that the city manager instructed staff to delay bargaining with the and the city had been preparing for a civic center project for years, but the city manager only reached out to the imam at the 11th hour, leaving no time to address differences through the meet and confer process. Remember that the same city manager advised this council to approve the project agreement on December 15th, 2015 that resulted in an unfair practice charge being filed against the city. Remember that the city manager executed the project agreement before the Fact Finders report was issued. That also resulted in yet another unfair practice charge being filed against the city. And tonight, the city manager asks you again to completely disregard the recommendations of the only neutral party to review the city's plans for the Civic Center project. The Neutral Fact Finder confirmed that what I've been reporting to you in this forum and through numerous letters and emails for well over six months, the Imam has been telling you all along to look after the welfare of your employees specifically. The fact finder found that the city should provide all custodial and all security services at the Civic Center. This is what the fact finder concluded after hearing Mr. Mike Conway testify for hours. In the final analysis, the neutral fact finder did not find credible. What the city manager has been telling you all along. I'm here to request two things. One, to direct the city to further meet and confer over the contracting out of the additional security work. The fact finder recommendation that all security be performed by the city employees is a reasonable one to to table this agenda item until probe has heard the imam's challenges to the decertification elections. As you may know, the imam has filed a request for injunctive relief and upwards of eight perp charges concerning the decertification elections. If the imam prevails that these certifications will either be dismissed or the elections will be rerun on May 24th of 2016. A letter submitted by H.R. Director Vasquez to the Council contains several important allies. They include that Mr. Vasquez wants you to believe that the plenary edge. Moore has insisted that it provide custodial maintenance and security services to the new civic center. However, it is the city that sort out the contracting work from the beginning, which is clear from the original RFP. Ms.. Basquiat states that employees shall not experience a reduction in hours, positions, duties or or compensation as a result of the Civic Center Project Agreement. The city attorney, Irma Rodriguez Meuser, however, confirmed that the city has never made such a guarantee. The city's lba pho only promises to protect the displaced employees specifically assigned to City Hall. It does not protect other employees who will be inevitably be displaced as a result of the reassignment of City Hall employees. Mr.. SUAREZ I'm going to let you actually continue because I think it's important that you finish even though the 3 minutes are up, so. Mr. MAYS I'm going to let him finish. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that, Mayor. Ms.. Basco stated that the AMM initially agreed to the city's proposal to contract out bargaining work unit. This is not true, and Ms.. Basquiat is well aware of that. And in closing, I'd just like to add that the city's course of conduct shows that it has no respect for its employees and their union. The and the city repeated illegal conduct in this matter is union busting, pure and simple. Union busting is morally repugnant and physically fiscally irresponsible, as evidenced by the fees paid to crony law firms and legal judgments against the city. Remember, history is replete with examples of good people who failed to speak against evil with catastrophic results. Please speak out against the injustice that's being repeated against the humble public servants, the employees of Long Beach. Thank you for your time, and I hope you've heard me too, this evening. Thank you, sir. Can we have a any other public comment? Larry, could you? What the previous Larry Good to cook has addressed. What the previous speaker has just intoned is goes to the issue, which I have long maintained. This City Council should take the requisite action. To dismiss the city manager. Take a vote of no confidence of the mayor and appoint a federal master to oversee the city until a new election is held. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. And the other public comment.

Plenary required subcontractors for security, maintenance, and operational services currently performed by city employees. After negotiations, an impasse was reached with IAM, leading to a fact-finding process. The fact-finder recommended contracting out certain positions, while preserving others. Staff recommends imposing the city's last, best, final offer, which includes provisions to continue meeting and conferring, preserving existing security services, and restoring contracted positions post-project completion without layoffs or reductions.

So if I can have the clerk, please read the. Perfect Report from Human Resources. Recommendation received file of fact finding report issued by the Fact Finding. Panel and adopt a resolution authorizing the implementation of the terms of the city's last, best and final offer. Described in the October. 24th, 2018 correspondence to the IAM detailing the scope of service on the Airport Security Division and the Long Beach Police Department and integration citywide. Thank you. Thank you very much. We are going to be opening up the next item, which is our 29. Appreciate that. I want to also just I know we're going to go into the item there. There are two parts of this item. So I just want to make sure that we're clear and it will require two separate votes as presented by the staff. The first part of the vote is to receive and file the fact finding report, which we will hear in a minute from staff as part of the this process. The second part, obviously, is actually adopting a resolution that would actual implement the terms of the city's last, best and final offer. It's there there has been a lot of discussion on this item, a lot of interest, rightly so, on an item that is important for us as a community. And so my recommendation is going to be that we hear the report as presented by staff. Then we allow the Council to ask all of its questions, which I think are important. There are a lot of questions that we also allow the public to comment so that the public is able to give their perspective on the report and their input, and so that the public the public process is out in the open. And then we receive and file the report as presented by staff. The second part of the motion, which is actually to implement the last, best and final offer, I'm going to recommend that we postpone the second part and to to a later date in May, a set by the city manager so that there could be some additional consideration by the council and some possible discussion. And so that is what will be my recommendation. Obviously, the Council will have an opportunity to to to look at that as we move forward. But I want to begin then the first part of this, which is the receive and file of the fact finding report. And and we'll go from there. So with that, Mr. West. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Council members. So our goal tonight, the action before you tonight will place our well, the action before you tonight. We'll place our police department in a supervisory capacity over all of our law enforcement officers at our Long Beach Airport. Currently, our 27 airport special security officers, all who carry firearms, are supervised by the airport director who has no public safety supervisory experience, not the police department. This is simply an organizational shift. All SOS will continue to carry weapons. All Eso's will continue to be. I am members. All Eso's will continue to work their regular duties at the airport. All Eso's will continue to maintain their classifications and salaries. This organization shift simply puts our eso's at the airport under police department supervision. There is precedent for this. In 2004, we had 30 Marine patrol officers. All of those officers carried weapons. They all reported to the Marine bureau manager who had no public safety experience. In 2004, we shifted our Marine patrol officers to the police department where they are supervised now by the police department. These Marine bureau patrol folk continue to carry firearms. They continue to be. I am members. They continue to be Marine patrol officers. They're simply now supervised by the police department as opposed to the Marine bureau manager who had no public safety experience. Just recently we removed we moved our park rangers from Parks and Recreation to the police department instead of being supervised by the Parks and Recreation director, again, who has no public safety supervisory experience. These park rangers are now supervised by the police department. They continue to carry firearms. They continue to be. I am members. They continue to be park rangers. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to our H.R. director and one of our managers. So Alex Vasquez and Dana Anderson will give the report. Good evening, mayor and council members. I want to introduce Dana Anderson. She's the bureau manager for labor relations and also Elmer Rodriguez Moosa, who's our outside counsel there, was involved in our negotiations on this. Particular item that went to a fact finding. So I'm going to turn over to Dana first and then we're happy to answer any questions. So that evening, Mayor and city council over the past year, representatives from city management and to enter in the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, also known as I am, have held a number of meet and confer sessions regarding the impacts of the integration of the Airport Security Division and the airport police detail into one section which would fall under the command and control of the Long Beach Police Department. The decision to integrate is to provide efficiencies through a better coordination of effort and one structural chain of command, both resources and personnel, including supervision, training and and deployment of staff to achieve consistency of public safety and maximize airport security efforts. The airport security division has been providing security and safety services for decades, and in response to increased security concerns following the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, the police department assigned an airport detail to augment the airport security division. In 2002, the city noticed the item in January 2015 of its intent to integrate the airport security division special services officers, also known as SOS and the Airport Police Division into one division to align their respective responsibilities, which was scheduled to move forward on April 1st, 2015, but was delayed. The purpose here is to have police in a supervisory capacity over law enforcement officers. At the airport on January 26, 2018, the city decided to proceed with the integration and again noticed I am of its intent to integrate the airport security division personnel and the airport police detail into the newly created airport police section. The reorganization was adopted by City Council for f y 19, contingent upon the completion of the ME to confer process with applicable unions. The reorganization does not impact employee salaries and would not result in additional police officer or CSO positions, and the requested action is not expected to require additional staff hours beyond the norm. The normal budget is scope of duties. After several months of negotiations and exchanges of proposals, the city declared impasse and provided written notification to. I am on October 24th, 2018 that we included the terms of the city's last, best and final offer, detailing the scope of service and items discussed as part of the public sector. Negotiation process. Once impasse has been declared, unions have the option to request a fact finding before an agency can impose their last, best and final offer. I am requested fact finding on November 21st, 2018, and the fact finding hearing was held on February 8th, 2019. The panel's report being issued on March 5th, 2019, which is attached to the council letter. The fact finding panel's report is advisory and provided the recommendation that the city implement its last, best and final offer for reasons stated in the fact finding panel's report. The city concurred with the recommendations of the fact finding panel and requests city's authorization to implement the terms of the city's last, best and final offer. This concludes the presentation and we are open to answer any questions. Great. I know we do have questions from council. I think there's been requests to do public comment and hear from the public first. So if you have public comment on this item, remember there's only one motion on the table right now which is to receive and file the report. So, please, any public comment, please come forward. The second part when we vote on the second part of the motion, which would be to to postpone the staff recommendation to implement that there would be public comment on that item as well, I believe. Right. Mr. City Attorney. Okay. Okay. So there's no I see no public comment on the receiving file of fact finding report. So let me go ahead and begin with Councilwoman Munger. Thank you. I have. Empathy for the police officers. Many of you know that I am a peace officer in the state of California, and so I empathize with the concerns of our USO's having lost some of their status. And it's my understanding that they have up to three years to join a general law enforcement agency. So one of the things that I think might be helpful is finding a way to get there. I don't think that that really happens in this process. And so with that, I'm open to hearing from my colleagues. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. And thank you. STAFF So I just wanted to to clarify a couple of things. You mentioned that. The officers would stay eso's. Yes. Correct. And that there would be no effect to their salaries. Correct. Is that indefinitely, or is there a time in the future that that could change? Would only change if there through a city council action there. Suppose we need them to be at the airport and we have no intention of changing their status at all. So the changes that they would be supervised by PD. It just who supervises them? Police department or the airport director. Or the airport director? Okay. Second question is and I know that there's some questions that we you know, just if you can answer this question, that'd be great. How many hours of training do officers do so officers currently have and how many would they be receiving if the supervision changed? I don't know how many they currently have. Perhaps someone else can answer that. I do know that by going to the police department with the training bureau, they'll have the opportunity. I think Post is going to offer, you know, 38 more training opportunities than they have today. So we expect the opportunity for much more training. I think we have the chief there. Chief, are you able to answer that question? Yes, ma'am. I'll do my best to try to answer that. So, Mayor. Members of the City Council. Any training moving forward would be proportional to the security officers duties. I believe under what we're proposing, the actual training would increase as we move forward as we have with. Please note that we have over 120 security officers that work for the police department now. Mr. West indicated some of the positions there and in all cases, when people were brought in under the brought to or under the umbrella of the police department, the training actually increased. That is obviously our field, whether we're talking about general law enforcement or security. And we're able to go out and look for the appropriate training classes so that all of our employees, whether sworn, civilian or otherwise, can participate in the best training to provide the best service to our community. Okay. Moving forward, I would love to to know some solid numbers moving forward, but for tonight, I'm okay. Um, I also wanted a point of clarification. I thought there was 27, as I said. Is that are airport. That's correct. There are currently 27 budgeted positions for security officers at the airport. And just to go back to your the previous question about training so we can complete that tonight, we are proposing that as we move the security officers from the airport under our family to Long Beach Police Department, that they're going to be attending a 30 hour Long Beach Police Department specific course designated to assimilate them into our organization and working environment. Beyond that, our department provides advanced officers training that we do provide to some of our security officers every year, and they would fall under that as well, which they do not currently receive in their current airport climate. Okay. And one other point of clarification. There's 27 budgeted positions. How many positions are actually filled right now? I believe it's 15. 15. I think there's 15 actually less than. Is there a reason why those positions aren't filled up to the full 27. Primarily because of a lot of what's going on here tonight. We've been going back and forth, would meet, confer and so on and so forth. And I think we in order to move forward and in order to fill those positions, we need to make sure that new employees coming in know exactly what they're going to be, what duties are going to be performing. Great. Thank you. I want to, you know, recognize that I asked some of these questions previously of you and of staff. And, you know, this is one of those areas that there's there's a lot of information that's available. And as a councilmember really trying to make the best decision and really trying to have all the facts in front of us so that we understand, obviously, an airport, you know, having 80% of the port in my district, safety is an utmost concern for me. And thinking about our airport the same. And so the question that I had asked before was, have there been issues, have there been situations outside of fact finding that we can do this? Have there been situations that cause concern for yourself or for our city manager on making this shift? I will do my best to answer that as well as your police chief. I have put this proposal to integrate forward as part of a team with the city manager under the direction of the city manager and in conjunction with the Human Resource Department and the City Attorney's Office. I would not be putting my name to anything that I didn't think was going to be advantageous to our entire community as far as safety goes. We're talking about the Long Beach Airport. The Long Beach Airport is ours and it is our intent to keep that safe. 24 seven. I know there's been a lot of comments made recently in the media, which I think are absolutely ridiculous that we're not going to be keeping an eye on our airport 24 seven which does cause citizens to call in and say, What the heck is going on? I'm not in the business of scaring people. I'm in the business of protecting people. And I assure our community that we are going to this plan will make our airport safer. So to continue with that, if you look at and again, the security officers that we have at the airport, great people, every single one of them. I can't wait if all of you approve to have them as part of our organizational family. But we've got to think about liability. And as we move forward in this current security and law enforcement environment, there has never been a time when law enforcement or security is being questioned more about what we do on an everyday basis . Everybody we stop. Everybody that we deal with constantly questions our policies. They question the level of accountability that we have. So when we're talking about use of force, foot pursuits, vehicle pursuits, all those things, those are things that we considered as we looked at the current policies that either exist or don't exist to make sure that we were going to, one, make this airport and community safer and allow this body to be as free of of risk or liability as we possibly could. So at the end of the day, that's why I'm recommending to you that recommending to you as a chief of police, that I'm I get held accountable, putting my name on the bottom of the paper when I am reviewing a use of force or something, God forbid, something more significant that your chief of police should be handling. And I think this community expects their chief of police to handle those type of challenges. Councilor, I'd like to point out, too, that a lot of this is coming from me as your city manager. Basically, it's just a personal promise that I have that I personally don't have law enforcement supervisor experience, so I shouldn't be supervising department that carries weapons, carries firearms, carrying lethal weapons. Additionally, our airport director, interim director Claudia Lewis, currently right now, she is the supervisor of 27 people at the airport that that carry weapons. And and clearly, Claudia doesn't have that supervisory experience either. So we just feel, as we did with the Marine bureau, as you do with the park rangers, if you're carrying lethal weapons, you should be under the police department's purview and not the not a department head. So I appreciate the response. And I think for all the reasons, Chief, that you laid out is probably why we have some community concerns coming up. And I just want to be honest, because I know that we've had lots of these conversations. And and so that's why it's taken me a step back today to be able to. Making the right decision. And if we haven't had those situations yet, that we really are thoughtful about this next step. So I want to hear from my colleagues. You know, I appreciate the 30 extra hour offer. I don't know what they currently got. And want to just clarify that there's 1527 currently there. But I look forward to hearing from my colleagues. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor Andrews. Yes, thank you, Mayor. Before I get started here and some of my questions I will be asking can be done with the yes or no. Before I get started, I just want to state that the Long Beach, you know, has a great police department and a great airport, which has a great group of security officers who have the primary responsibility for securing the safety of the airport. I understand the efficiency that can occur by placing so under the police department control. However, I want to fully understand the potential impact to safety and security as well as working conditions of Esso. My questions are and they can be done with the yes or no with the number of positions sold at the airport be maintained. Yes. Well, the hours of deployment be maintained 24, seven and through and 65 days a year. Yes. What is the status of the so? Chief. I'm sorry, Councilman. Can you please or. I'm sorry, Vice Mayor, can you please repeat the question? What is the status of an as? Oh, would that be maintained or if not, well. Well, if it not maintaining with the SS. Oh. Have the equivalent of training. You are posturing. Yes. I'm sorry, sir. The status will remain the same. Okay. And will it be maintained? You're saying? Yes. Or if not will to maintain be the CSO have the equivalent of the training that the others have. I'm sorry. Are you asking about that? The post training? Yes. What is the status of that for the ASOS? Okay. I'm sorry, sir. I didn't understand you. That was my fault. On the first one regarding the post training. Post is a state organization and initially there were several officers who attained post certificates. And when Post went back to review the information, they found that they incorrectly issued those certificates. And so that is a state of California post issue that does not have anything to do with the city of Long Beach. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, uh, another question. Will this move affect any representation by the I am training status in a direction that people are under? No. I think because of that, I really think this is kind of confusion and I don't think we should have really ever gotten to this point. But I'm going be willing to listen to my other colleagues and I'll move on from there. Thank you. Thank you. Vice Mayor Andrews, Councilmember Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So my colleagues have asked some good questions, and so I won't try to dove into the weeds here. So. Mr. City Manager so we've been in negotiation for a period of time. It's come to a point where a fact finding was requested. That fact finding report we received today, that fact finding report summed up, essentially said that that the chief has the authority to make this make this change. Correct. The city manager has the authority. Okay. And so the city manager certainly now, I guess there's a sentiment in the community that there if the council voted to if we had voted to do that, there's an unintended consequence of somehow the security circumstances that at the airport would somehow be diminished. And there's also a concern about not being federally compliant or not having a federal law enforcement official on site 24 hours. So my question is, can you, Mr. Chief, can you just speak to whether there's. I know that there's a perception, but is there anything to this? And and have you have you done any thinking about this this federal issue? Have you heard about this issue of this federal standard of a law enforcement official needing to be on site 24 hours? Councilmember Before we answer the first part, let's get to the second one. I'm going to turn it over to Gary perhaps to have that discussion. Actually, Marion, councilmembers are going to have outside counsel Irma. Rodriguez addressed the federal issue that you just raised about. Sure. The quality of it. Good evening, Mayor, and members of the council. This issue, with respect to the legality of the proposal under the homeland security regulations was first raised at the Fact-Finding Panel stage by IAM. I have carefully reviewed the cited regulations and I'm here to opine that the proposal with respect to the integration complies with those regulations. And I'll explain why the regulations generally set forth that the city or the operate in which the airport operates has a discretion to determine for itself the appropriate security program. And what it is required to do is to have an appropriate number and manner of security program that is adequate to support our security at an airport here . The city has is not changing the program. It is changing the reporting of where the ESOS currently report. There is no plan to change the number of individuals, change the number of hours and in fact has been previously testified. The program is intended to enhance security by allowing the CISOs to focus on security duties at the airport as opposed to on near the airport premises. Second, the regulations also require that those individuals who are providing these security services have to meet certain minimum qualifications and have certain training programs as to the minimum qualification they have to have the authority to arrest. Nothing in this proposal changes that authority. They will continue to meet the minimum qualification of having the authority to arrest. With respect to the training program, what the regulations provide is, again, discretion to the local agency to provide a training program that it believes satisfies its security program detail. And it says, quite frankly, that it can either be state regulations or guidelines or local agency or guidelines. The reason it is my opinion that the state regulations are satisfied is that the state agency post has determined that the CISOs do not need to be a post certified to in order to do their position. Second, our local agency, our police department, has developed a training program that they believe is best tailored to provide the training that the security officers need to provide the security services. So that is my assessment of the legal homeland security regulations. Thank you. And then the second part, someone will respond to me. I'm sorry. Could you repeat the first question? Sure. So he so much for that that explanation on. So I see some diligence have been done to that that issue. The second piece is that there's a perception that there's an unintended consequence to making this change, that somehow there is the airport is less safe. And if there is and my interest is simply if we take the bargaining process to the side, you know, and separate that because that has its own processes and it appears that's being followed, if there's an unintended consequence, consequence for safety, then I'd just like to sort of narrow the conversation and see if there's a gap. How do we just fill the gap and ensure that that the presence of safety is still there? So I guess the question is, is there a lack of service? Is there going to be a period of time where there will be no, you know, no security at the airport? Any gaps in service whatsoever? Councilman Richardson? No, the simple answer to that is no. Okay. As we move forward, the plan, the proposed integration plan that we put together utilizes the expertize of the airport security officers that we have. The airport police officers that we have, puts them under one chain of command under a police lieutenant, which was an out there before. Improves communication and coordination. Maintains regulatory compliance. And at the end of the day, when we're talking about safety, it's not only community safety but officer safety. And so we're mitigating liability. At the same time, we believe that our organizational values, our training programs, our equipment, our resources and our discipline will improve safety for everybody involved out there and make it much better than what it has been. Thank you. Love to hear from the public. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember. Councilor appears. I had first the question were at 12 or 15 oiseaux at the airport. We also have new flights coming and going. So I'm assume that we're going to have more people coming and going. And so can we get a timeline on when we expect all 27 positions to be filled regardless of this process or not? We'll be able to get you something right away, perhaps in a day or two. Okay. And then my next one is more of a comment and not a question because we're kind of dancing around it. The question of airport security for me is, one, the number of hours of training. And I appreciate the number of hours that our police chief has told us. I look forward to hearing from IAM on how many hours of training they provide. And two is just the reality that some folks, people of color, Latinos, friends just don't feel comfortable around. PD So the question for me is, are these officers going to be in security clothes? Are they going to be in PD clothes if they were to switch over? I absolutely respect the fact about the people of color, which I am one of. About the way they feel about police. That's the way I grew up in regards to uniforms. And just going back to the training. In the last several years, our police officers have received many hours in training with implicit bias, procedural justice. And I could go on and on. You know, I know you have that. We've had in regards to the uniform that the airport security officers will be wearing, the uniform itself will not change. Thank you. Look forward to public comment. Councilwoman Mungo. I just want to ask another question. Is our airport safe? Currently are we meeting the standards and is our airport safe? Because I'm it's just really frustrating and irresponsible to lead the public to believe otherwise, unless it is factually. I'm going to answer that first. I'll leave it I'll leave it to the chief in a moment. And I'm looking to our interim director, Claudia Lewis. If we do not have a safe airport, we will not have an airport. Our airport would be shut down so fast if we didn't have a if we didn't have an ability to provide safety with our fire department. There are police department there working with TSA and FFA. So I just want to assure you that there is no such thing as a as an unsafe airport. If you have an unsafe airport, the airport's gone. You don't have an airport. I appreciate that. I think that it's really important to just be clear that it is still safe to travel out of Long Beach Airport. No flights have been added since 2000 and maybe 16. When we added the nine slots, we're still at 50 slots a day in and out of the airport. And so the passenger ratio and the flights and all of that has been maintained. Many of you know what the airport is in my district. Many of you also know that I am a PC a32 certified. I'm a PC eight 30.2 certified peace officer in the state of California. I'm very familiar with the training requirements. I've had extensive discussions about these changes and I had a wish we wouldn't be where we are right now. But I. I hope that in listening to the public, we can hear from them potential solutions to to make sure that we can find a way to get through this tonight. Councilman Gonzales. Yes. Thank you so much. And I'm of the same mindset. I think we're all here for the similar purpose, consistency and safety. First, of course. Just a couple clarifying questions, I think, to Councilman Richardson's point. You know, we did receive a letter from our Congressmember Alan Lowenthal, and I just wanted to make sure I was getting clear as to what is currently. Who currently has the authority now to arrest on in the airport. I'm just get I need to get that clear in my head as to if there's any changes once if this were to move forward what type of training. I know we've gone over it, but I need to just get that super crystal clear as to where we're at now and what this would. There would be no changes to arrests or how it operates. None whatsoever. None whatsoever. They're just BS. You would still be supervised by the police department instead of Miss Louis, so they would basically be exactly the same, except you've got someone to you differently and there will be other training opportunities. So there's no difference in authority versus PD or ESSOS right now. Well, the authority the authority would go through the police department instead of Ms.. Lewis. Right. Okay. Okay. Second question. Maybe, councilman, to stand to partly answer that question, maybe you were alluding to this. And I mean, I'm not sure if everyone is aware. So currently as it exists right now, Palm Beach PD operates out of the airport. And so currently we both have both Eso's and we have also the Long Beach Police Department. And they actually work together concurrently on airport security, along with other federal agencies, airport staff and a variety of of security measures. Of course, that's necessary with both the federal level and the local level to make security happen. And so just also want to clarify that I think there's a misconception about PD being there or not being there. And Lombard PD is on site as of course, are the the S.O. team. Aps-C trackers, 15 police officers assigned to the airport. There's 27 eso's assigned to the airport. There's. I think that's why I'm mentioning this, because I think there is a lot of confusion around that. And you're seeing we're seeing it out in the press as well. So I just want to make sure we're I know it's difficult, but, you know, just to make sure we're super clear on that, because I don't think everyone understands that necessarily. And then the second question is. Also the proposed I mean, there's a proposed schedule that would include gaps, you know, between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.. So we're saying there would not be any gaps. Again, I'm just want to make sure we're clear because it is out there. And I know, Chief, you've mentioned that that is not the case. So if you can just can continue responding to that. Councilwoman again, Councilwoman Gonzalez, thank you for that question. And it's something that keeps on coming up. Again, there were misstatements made in the press rhetoric. They're not factual. Our airport is covered 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And for our citizens or anyone that intends to travel through the Long Beach Airport or Long Beach Airport is absolutely safe. Are we always looking for ways to improve? Absolutely we are. But for anybody who either read or heard on the radio that we don't have any coverage between 10 p.m., 11 p.m. and 5 p.m.. If anybody out there is listening to me, watching me on television, you try to commit a crime at the Long Beach Airport. During those hours, you're going to get arrested. There's going to be consequences. That airport is safe. It's covered. It has been and it will be. Thank you. And I think, again, I'm we're going to capture that and put it somewhere, because I think everyone needs to understand that that's very important. So with that, I would just say thank you for this. I'm looking forward to hearing more as well. I needed to clarify a few things on my end because it did get a little bit hazy on on my end in understanding where we're currently at. And then what brought this forward even after, you know, we've had a lot of catastrophes in the past and now it's, you know, some time later and we want to make sure we're keeping the airport as safe as possible here in Long Beach. Those are my questions and we will move forward. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Councilman Austin. Thank you. I'll be brief. This is a while. It seems like it's more complicated than it needs to be, in my opinion. I think I did have a couple of questions just to kind of summarize how we got here. The meeting confirmed process, whenever there is a change in policy or duties or wages and benefits, there's there's an obligation to meet and confer. Is that correct? Yes. Can you explain to the public and those listening what the meeting confer actually consist of? Sure. So the meeting of our process basically consist of the well, actually in this particular instance, this was a managerial decision whenever the city has the authority to make management decisions. But whenever we do so, we have to me to confer over the impacts of that actual decision. So in this particular instance that the media confer comprised of the impact of the changes as a result of PD taking oversight of the airport security officers. Okay. So during the meeting for process, obviously you met and confer with the bargaining representatives. I am. Correct. That is correct. Both I am in. And. How many meetings that you have in over or over what period of time? There were ten meetings, approximately eight and a half months. How long did each meeting last? Approximately about an hour and a half. Okay. And where? A proposal was exchanged. The city presented a, I believe, a total of seven. And we received one from I am. I wanted to to also discuss the existing chain of command at the airport with as a source. We've heard that they report to the airport director. But in terms of strategic security protocols and things of that nature, who do they report to now? What is the chain of command for? So currently the chain of command at the airport. The CEOs report directly to the deputy director, Mr. Juan Rios Lopez. Mr. Lopez. Well, welcome. Okay. And does he have any sort of security? No, he does not. He does not have. No, he does not have any security background or specialty or certifications. Okay. So that brings me to my next point. In terms of training existing, what type of existing training like for the skills today? What type of training do they receive to do their job and to keep our air ports safe? So currently there was a policy established in 2016 which afforded the opposed to go to post post training. Up until when it started? Well, I think they have been doing it prior to, but I believe there were varying levels between Poles wanting to. But as of 2016, they established an actual policy stating. So let me go back to the is there a supervisor, is there a a. A. Like a lieutenant? Is there a chain of command for the officials existing? Currently there's the SS. So low levels they have three and then they have for which the fourth act as supervisors. But they report directly to Mr. Lopez Rios. It's a supervisor position, not a lead position. Correct. Okay. And so the existing training you said is it was was Porte Post or is post. Correct. Currently, because we haven't we haven't moved forward in the integration. So currently it is post. And it was since 2015, there's been no training. So there haven't been any new souls to be sent to training. Okay. And if they were to go under the direction of the Long Beach PD and the chief of police, I heard the chief say that there would be more training opportunities. And that kind of concerns me a little bit because to me there it doesn't sound like there has been a whole lot of emphasis on training and perhaps the chief could answer this question should this this integration happen? What type of training would you be able to provide these employees to keep our airports safe beyond what they have already received and what they're receiving now? So one thing I'd like to clarify. So one of the things that will happen with this integration is that. Or. As we were going through the mean confer process. We also recognized that it was necessary to evaluate what type of training is appropriate for the duties that the CISOs perform. And I think that's one of the. Key things that came out. Of this process is just identifying what level of training is appropriate, and then also identifying other post certified training that could be made available to the employees. And that's what we outlined in the report. But I'll go ahead. To the chief. Sorry. You don't have to get. Councilman Austin and try and answer your questions. So in regards to the opportunities for post training, there are at least I mean, look at my notes. I don't want to get the number incorrect. There are 36 courses in the post catalog that are hopefully new employees will have an opportunity to go to in the future. And they they range from and there's a lot of really cool training. So just like our employees do, they, they, they can go into a catalog for post and look at what's proportionate to their duties and then through a supervisor approving it, we can go there. And I do want to clarify, you asked a very good question earlier and it was in regards to post training, to give you an example. A Long Beach police officer, like the ones you see sitting behind you, they get about 3000 hours of training, which is divided from a six month academy to a six month fill training officer certified program through post and then another six months of a probationary period. We do have individuals. I'd have to look at the entire background as to how it happened. I don't know how we got there, but individuals were allowed to go to post certified training. And then what ends up happening is in order to be classified by post as a peace officer, you have to enter a department that does general law enforcement to be certified with that FTO program and that probationary period. Unfortunately for our airport security officers, that's not available because they weren't part of a general law enforcement police department. So in a sense and I can fill I think I could fill with that. They're saying, man, I feel like I got cheated here. But coming if this integration gets approved, what we're going to be able to do is not only train them in perishable skills training that we afford our own employees, but we're able to identify other courses through post because they are now part of the Long Beach Police Department where their training will be enhanced. So would their in-service training be enhanced because they are part of Long Beach PD? Their training is absolutely going to improve from what they have now. Okay. And then the the other piece is the post training. Who pays for that? What we do as a police department. So that will be a I'm sorry I cut you off. That will be afforded to to these fellows as well, should they choose to, to go to various post training that may be afforded to them, that may be within the the scope of their duties. Every employee will get a piece of the pie. Okay. I have no further questions. Thank you for the clarification. And, Mr. Mayor, I'm a I'm okay with with what? Postponing the other vote. But I do think that hopefully there is some some opportunity between now and when this comes back for the I am the employee group as well as our union. I want to talk about hopefully some some amicable solutions that we can move this forward on this. This is obviously safety and airport and consistency is number one. And to the to the employees, I'll just tell you, I've taken this issue very seriously. I've talked to your leaders. Sal Vasquez is, you know, one of my favorites. I appreciate always the conversations with you. I've read your email, you section six, a memo. You is very clear. And and I do understand that that we're where the city is trying to go in terms of streamlining the operation. And so hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement. Thank you, Councilman. Councilmember Ringa. Thank you. For purposes of transparency, I did have meetings with the IAM, with the city manager, with the chief of police to talk about and H.R. to talk about this very issue. And I think during all those conversations, there was no question about the integrity and the dedication that our souls have to the airport and what value they have in the security. But is it safe? But and Councilmember Austin brought up something about the meeting code, a process which also included in the remaining code for process is a change in working conditions. And I think this is what this is. Basically, it's a whole issue about working conditions, changing basically the authority or the oversight of vessels in the airport from the airport director to the chief of police. I see that as a basic premise here in terms of what the issues are. We went through fact finding because of the fact that that wasn't able to be resolved in terms of what that transition or that change would bring to the systems in the airport and the integration, if you will, of police officers into also incorporating the airport as part of their responsibilities as well. So the overall overlying issue that I see here is not so much that there's going to be a loss of pay or change of hours or a change in in in responsibilities and most importantly, a a decline or a lessening of safety for the public at our airports. I don't see that at all. This is a management problem. The management issue, it's it's one that management has a right to manage. I can understand that. I think all three of the four of the bodies that i talked to in terms of the iam and h.r. Police and city manager, we all they all understand that we all we all know that. However, it's the transition and the integration integration of PD and s so into the into one that is the issue here and that has not been resolved. So I would support going, receiving and filing this report as we have it now. As Mayor said, however, on the second motion, I think that we I also would support that as well. Give it some time. I think that the all of the by all the all the authorities concerned here need to work that out. You need to get into a point of. Yes. Where we can all get together and agree. And at one point there's going to be an agree to disagree. But I feel more comfortable knowing that you all had have have had that very focused discussion about the actual integration and what it really means in regards to the CIOs and their change in working conditions, because that's what it comes down to as far as as I see it. So just one question. What does the receiver of file motion do right now for this integration plan and follow that up with the the motion to to put it up for to sometime in May. By taking a bow tonight just to receive in follow. You're just accepting the fact that you had the final report from the venue panel and you're receiving it. You're accepting it. You're taking no further action other than that. Okay. The second vote will come later tonight. If you wish to postpone, I'm taking some formal action. Okay. I'm good. And customer super anon. Thank you. I'd also like to hear public comment. But I just had one thought on when Councilman Gonzales was asking, like, can we memorialize the fact that we have security there? I just look to the year 2017 when JetBlue violated our late night noise ordinance 676 times. So that's on average, 1.85 operations per night. Guess what? Not only was there security, there we were. The airport was open by all practical purposes. So that to airport. Impacted council districts like like I represent that. That was very unnerving to hear that the airport had no security. So I'm glad to put that myth to rest. And the other question I have, and this is related to the noise ordinance. When we looked. At reworking that. We look to. Other best practices and other airports. And did the fact finding group ever do that? You know, what scenario is that Orange County or other airports? Was that part of the study? The noise. Ordinance. Can you repeat the question, please? I brought up the noise ordinance because we don't want to revisit 2017 and staff and our city attorney is looking at different systems to improve our to reduce the number of late night violations. They looked at other airports and practices at other airports regarding noise violations or rules. Did the fact finding group look at best case scenarios at other airports on the security issue and whatnot or was not not part of the study? So the fact finding panel didn't look at particularly noise ordinance, but they did look at other security initiatives. I'm sorry. I guess I misspoke. Okay. I brought up the noise ordinance because it's an analogy of how. We tackle one problem. We looked at other airports, okay, now we have a security issue or a security force issue. Did we look at other airports, how they operate, what they do? Thank you. So, yes, as part of this process, we did look at other agencies as part of the fact finding process and the media confer. And there. Are. I believe there was a total of 11 other agencies that have police over security of the airport. Okay. And would you happen to know if you know what. Airports are what. Are the practices in airports similar to our size, our our community and whatnot? So the airports that we that were reviewed were Burbank, San Jose International City of L.A. International. Oakland International. John Wayne Irvine. San Diego International. So on here. I only brought five with me. Oh, I'm sorry. So Oakland, Ontario, Palm Springs International. Sacramento International, Santa Barbara and San Jose International. Okay. And the findings there are are what exactly? So the findings that all of those airports operate under the same manner in which we're proposing in which the police department have or has oversight. Okay. Thank you for that. I'm going to go ahead and support the motion to postpone the decision and move on to a date. Not certain, but possibly in May. Mayor, I just one clarification, please. When I said there would be one change of physical for the service, would not be allowed to make traffic stops as we go forward. They continue to be allowed to make arrests, but not traffic stops. Okay. Well, let's we have a motion in a second to receive and file the the report. So there is a motion in a second to do that. We've taken public comment on that item already, so please cast your votes. Motion carries. We have a second we have a second item here, which is to the recommended motion is that I'm making is to postpone the staff recommendation to a date in May as set by the city manager. And so there is a motion any second on that. Is there a public comment on that motion? Very good. You certainly support. Any safety measures that will ensure the safety of our airport. But I think one of the most inane. Facts. We were presented here today. Oh, it. Is. We have an. Individual whose. Will be voting on this, the security issue, who the public records indicate. Almost every week demonstrates manifest. Mental instability in addition to mental instability certified. In the Long Beach police records relative to the individual arrest and have a person like that. Weighing in. On any aspect of. Safety at an airport. Is simply. Inane. And needs to be addressed by this council. Either tonight or in the future. Thank you. Speaker, please. Good evening, mayors, members of the council. I had some prepared remarks, but I must admit I'm somewhat confused and shocked by some of the allegations that were made here this this evening. Let's set some facts straight. The reports in the media as of late only addressed the situation if this proposal went through. If this proposal went through, the police department's proposal is to not have L-A. Excuse me. Long Beach police officers assigned to the airport between the hours, approximately, of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.. That's what was stated in the media, and that is what is stated in the proposal. It's somewhat confusing if they believe that proper security isn't available during business hours, if you will. Those would be hours between 7 a.m. and 10:59 p.m.. But after 11:00, I suppose that if somebody called 911a police unit that's traveling the the the area of the airport would respond. So that's what was stated in the media. Someone suggested that the reason that we're not up to 27 is because of this meet and confer that has been taking place for about a year. I've been here six years and we have never been north of 15 PSOs for the past six years. So it hasn't been the past few months that we have been in a meeting confer. Mr. West has an issue apparently with management not having a law enforcement background. Well, the fact is that for 35. Years there hasn't been a law enforcement overseer of the Long Beach Eso's at the airport. This has been quite well. And the reason we're here today is not because the union negotiated post training for the eso's. This was as a direct result of management. The city manager at that time, the city attorney at that time, and the person in charge of the airport over a quarter century ago coming to the union through a meet and confer process and asking us if it would be okay to send these folks to post training. Now let's talk about training. I believe that statements were made to the council that somehow training is going to be between 30 and 60 hours. This is a deficiency of the current training. The current post one training is a minimum of 660 hours. This is a training that was imposed by this city for these tests. Taking that away. Taking the authority away is an injustice. And that, we believe, will be a weakness of security. I am speaking going forward. I am not speaking currently. I also believe that the airport is safe today. I don't believe that the L4 will be safe if you reduce training from 660 hours to 30 to 60 hours. They also want to take away arrest powers, even though it was just said that they will continue arrest powers. No, they will continue arrest powers if they call 911. And if they call the police person, the red and the red lights will be transferred to amber lights. So there's a significant amount of information that's being withheld from this council, and I think it needs to be explored. I urge and recommend that an independent study of this proposal be made so that we can make an intelligent decision. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And I can fe six districts stand here in support of my union brothers and sisters. I don't believe that the chain of command to be streamlined into more centralized power with the language police department. This the last time we've seen something sizable to this level was when chief of police in L.A., Mr. Bratton and then Mayor James Hahn were trying to do the same thing with the World LAX International Airport, which is not it's autonomous. It's an autonomous division. It's not under the LAPD. In regards to the current handling of our airport here. I think this issue is unfavorably speaking against the great job that the current CSO officers are doing in securing our airport , and it's undermining public morale, which is unnecessary because we have had no issues. And I'm just here to support. I, as a member of the community, am a bit suspicious of any centralization of safety in regards to our police department going under our police department. And also wary of what could be a very sizable contract in the future. You know, because I like to believe that the numbers alone we should report will be a huge one in the next 10 to 20 years. So in the short term, I think a lot of the implications of what this fact finding report is, is not speaking on is what will this look like? You know, 20 years from now, where we're talking about 12, 12 jobs. Right now, we're actually 27. We're talking about maybe, you know, in ten years, you know, Alex, they employ over 600 people. So what if one day that's going to be 600, you know, 324 officers there? What about in 20 years, 20, 30 years from now, when it's not just JetBlue who's the hub here, it's five other hubs that are here. And then we're talking about at that time, you know, obligations towards the city budget and being thrice full to accommodate police officers on the campus of the airport. So against the city, along with the police department taking over this. And I'm here in support of our current. So brothers and sisters. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, these are the last two speakers. And then we're we've closed the speakers list. Hi. My name is Dan Gonzales. I'm president of Local Large 1930 representing the Special Services peace officers at the Long Beach Airport as well. My address is on file. I'm a city employee, been here almost 24 years. Currently, I'm serving as an associate with the Port of Long Beach Harbor Patrol, and my assignments are swing ship patrol as well as field training for my department. First of all, I'm going to deviate from my my thing here. I'm a little concerned about the the city manager saying that you have to be a peace officer, law enforcement, to supervise law enforcement. Isn't he the boss of the chief? But is it? It's just confusing to me. All right. Honorable Mayor Garcia and city council members. First of all, I want to express my appreciation for the complicated, complicated task you and the council have with this issue. I also want to mention my appreciation for Chief Luna and the task he has to help keep this city safe. With that said, it is my belief that the direction to lessen the training standards and duties of the so peace officers assigned to the airport is misguided. These decisions will add to city liability and require more Long Beach police officers and ultimately cost the taxpayers more. I've been part of the meet and confer process and I am deeply disturbed by what I've seen. I've seen the Long Beach PD use its influence to convince Poste to revoke certifications from our members. It wasn't an audit. They didn't just decide to audit what they were doing, and it only affected our members, not the folks that passed their FTO process and went on to other agencies. Somehow that magically didn't happen. So it has only only affected I am members. I thought that the you know, all this was done to further the political goal of the police department. I thought the police were supposed to do what's right, not what's easy. I've seen the police department use the argument that. Less training for my members will increase safety. As an instructor, I tell you. Officers do not rise to the occasion. They default to the level of their training. This is why. Your organization, Long Beach PD, has a SWAT team training weekly and not hoping that they'll just figure it out and rise to the occasion. My first eight years with the city, I proudly worked for the Long Beach Police Department as an S.O. not and I've had lots of I still have a lot of friends there. I'm really concerned about their management and the direction towards mediocrity. They're looking for the bare minimum and not not exceeding and not going higher and better. I asked the council not to approve the emotion, instead direct the management team to head in a logical, ethical and safe direction. That makes sense for everyone, including the community, we all think. Thank you very much. Thank you. Final speaker. Good evening, Mayor and city council members. My name is James Sweitzer. I am a third district resident and a proud member of the Democratic Socialists of America Long Beach chapter. So I'm also here and proud to stand in solidarity with the hardworking city employees with I Am 1930. So I am speaking tonight in opposition to this item. And the you know, we've heard it called multiple things, you know, labor dispute, management issue. But I want to make some observations today and call it what it is, which is a takeover, and that this is an orchestrated takeover of the airport by the Long Beach Police Department . And it's no secret that this has been an effort that has been going on for years and is the you know, I can't help but also wonder that we're talking about the excesses of the airport tonight. And I'm wondering about the CISOs here at City Hall. I'm also wondering about the Eso's, just as is mentioned at the harbor department or at the Port of Long Beach as well, and wondering what comes next. But I also believe that the track records of the airport and police department should speak for themselves. And the past two years, the city of Long Beach has actually done an amazing job at touting the airport's accolades and honors. And I feel like every month I'm opening up a new article in a city newsletter or in the local media about how it's the best airport. It's the safest airport. And I think that's something to celebrate that our Long Beach airport is a community asset and it's a source of pride for the city. But meanwhile, within the first seven months of receiving the Metro policing contract, for instance, and as somebody who regularly uses the blue line to travel to L.A., the Long Beach Police Department had already killed Cesar Rodriguez within those first seven months. And by 13 months into the contract, as the Long Beach Post reported, the Long Beach Police Department was responsible for more than half of all of the arrests in the metro system, despite only policing four miles of a 98 mile system. So I want to let that sink in, because I think that speaks for itself. And knowing all of this, I can't help but wonder why we are risking the reputation of our community asset and giving more authority to the city's biggest liability. So I want to put that out there as a question, and I urge you all to I appreciate postponing this, but I ultimately want to urge you to not allow this integration to happen. Thank you. Thank you. We have a we have a motion in a second. I want to as we as we take the vote, I just want to say something which I think is important, is that I want to reiterate something I think everyone agrees agrees on, and that is that the Long Beach Airport is a wonderful, safe place that people love to travel to. And it's because of the team that is currently in place. And I personally want to thank the Palm Beach police officers that are there working every day, work really hard to keep our airport safe. And I want to thank them, Chief, the entire team, the Sasso team that is there, that work in coordination with our Long Beach Police Department and that have been doing great work. I see our CSO officers when I'm traveling in and out of the Long Beach Airport and we appreciate their work and they work alongside the TSA , the FBI that is doing work at the airport on a regular basis, and a lot of other agencies to make sure that we have a world class airport. And so to the entire team that is there. I just want to thank them for making the Long Beach Airport a really great, safe place to fly. And I will add that I appreciate whenever I go seeing our Long Beach police officers are so officers, to be very honest, always friendly, always working with folks and I think providing excellent service to the community. So thank you for the work that's been that has been happening. And and I want to thank everyone for for their interest, of course, in this issue. So please. Councilmembers Castro votes. Motion carries. Great. Thank you very much. We're going to be moving on now to our next item here. On second. What's. Just. Yeah. Yeah. Let me let me just real briefly, if I can have. Hearing one.

Councilmember Lewis, you are the prime sponsor of Council Bill 119869 and are recognized in order to address this item. We may have lost council member Lewis, actually. All right. Sorry, folks. It looks like we lost Councilmember Lewis from the virtual meeting, so we're going to give it an opportunity to go ahead and see if we can get him logged back in. He's calling in now, is what I understand he is doing. But council bill 119869 folks was heard. I will I will fill the time here was heard in my committee on Friday, September 11th, this past Friday. We had an opportunity to be briefed by Katrina, as you heard Councilmember Lewis describe this morning. This ordinance really provides an enforcement mechanism for the city to actually create a system by which to enforce any potential violations of civil emergency orders that have been or will be issued now or in the future. As we know, during this COVID 19 economic crisis and public health crisis, we've had an opportunity to consider several civil emergency orders attempting to regulate private industries. This is an opportunity for us to create some civil mechanisms by which to create enforcement of those emergency orders. And and today we have an opportunity to consider this. It did pass unanimously and sorry, it was not considered in my committee for votes, since it was referred to full city council. But we did have an opportunity to have a full conversation and briefing on this council. Bill and I will now hand it over to Councilmember Lewis to provide any additional remarks he might want to add. He has joined us now via phone. Councilmember Lewis, please. Hey. Thank you, Madam President. Hopefully I'll be able to be back on in person in just a moment here. Appreciate your remarks. That was an excellent summary. I think I'll mostly stand by those remarks, given my comments last Friday in your committee, as well as my comments, the briefing this morning. And just look forward to voting on this and and updating the Seattle Municipal Code. Excellent. Are there any other comments on the bill? Councilmember Lewis, I mean, Councilmember Herbold.

I'm currently working on that councilmember verballed with the mayor's office. We we probably don't need to I mean, it goes without saying, and I don't know if this is the basis of your question, but the law cannot apply retroactively to violations that had already occurred if they had. But so I think going forward, you know, once these, you know, go into effect, you know, folks will be on notice that this is a potential impact. But, you know, we're seeing it maybe it makes sense to to reissue the orders or to to somehow modify them to be in compliance.

We actually voted on consent earlier. Okay, now we're on to the regular agenda. Regular agenda? All right. Would you read the item, please? Sure. Item ten Communication from Councilman Price, Councilmember Superdad, Councilwoman Mingo and Councilman Andrew's recommendation to request an update regarding where the city is at with the RFP process for consulting services related to updating the city's Gateway Signage Program. Councilwoman Price. Thank you. Is there a staff report on this item? Yes, there is. Mayor and City Council would be happy to give an update of where we are. If you recall in the budget that the Council passed in October, there was direction to start an effort to improve our gateway signage. Shortly thereafter, the city put the city staff put together a scope of work to put out for a consultant. We're actually looking at three different components within that study. One would be for gateway signage at our Gateway areas, and we've done some initial survey work to determine what we have at our gateway areas and provided that as part of the RFP. We're also looking at how to improve our parking signage in the downtown. That would be a second component as that's been a focus of the city and the city council to try to improve some of the parking wayfinding in downtown. And the third is we have a condition of approval for our beach projects to try to make our beach signage a little bit more easy to follow and how to direct people to the beach. That's a third component. We did a survey of all of our signs in the downtown area and did a survey of all of our beach signs and then released a request for proposals in December that closed the end of December. In January, we received proposals from from several firms. We have seven proposals that have been received. And staff are reviewing those and expect to do interviews of the top candidates in the next week or so. And then we'll get back to the city council with recommendation for an award for a selected firm. Once we know what the costs are and and what who the selected firm would be, we'd be back to the city council. And that concludes the staff report. So would the selected firm be in charge of all three of those components, Gateway Beach and Parking? Yes. We are asking a firm to be able to bid on all three of those. We'll see if they choose to bid on just one or so, but we expect them to choose to bid on all three. What's important is that there will be different timelines for all three. We want to be we've heard that the focus from the council really is on the gateway signage. And so we know that will be prioritized. And those are also going to be different funding sources. So we want to be able to separate those three different efforts. But it would be one firm so that there is a consistent standard and so that the beach signs look very similar to the parking signs look similar and complement our gateway signs. And are we going to have the recommendation from staff come back to council the same way we normally do when we have responses to proposals? Or will the Council have the opportunity to maybe hear from the the top two bidders? Let's say, because this is a very creative project and it really is is not something that we might be able to quantify so that the creativity of the company, the vision that they have for Long Beach, their connection to the city, the understanding of the need for us to have a brand and that kind of thing might all be factors above and beyond just what the cost of the project might be. So you're absolutely correct. In an RFP, cost is one of the factors, but it's not the sole factor. So we're not required to go with the low bidder. When we do a request for proposals, we are looking for a service and we're looking for something that complements and meets our goals and our objectives. So we would be going through a staff evaluation process of those seven proposals, we would be bringing back a recommendation. We certainly could bring back some additional information about some of the other vendors that were that were proposed and provide some additional detail on why we recommended one over the other and why we feel that they're the best fit. Given the Council's goals and given that creative aspect that you mentioned. And if Council wanted a presentation from the recommended bidder in terms of what was involved in the scope of their their response to the RFP, could we request that at that time or in advance of that? And so we'll talk a little bit with the city attorney with purchasing on on when you see that you're normally making an award. But we can certainly I think the intent is to try to get some information about what who they are and what they do and what their level of expertize is. So I think we'd certainly be able to find something to meet your needs there. Okay. I mean, the only concern that I have is this is a very creative process kind of, you know, certainly not at the at the level in terms of project costs as the Civic Center was, but certainly something that we want to reflect the spirit of the community. And so picking a vendor that we think gets what we're trying to do with this, with this concept is important. And I mean, I don't even know who sits on the committee that makes the recommendation, but I think council should have a say a little bit in terms of what direction we're headed with the company that we're going to partner with. This is a very long term partnership and whatever they come up with is going to last for many decades. So. So I think part of what is important tonight is hearing that passion from you and from the city council. If that really is something that you want us to focus on, we need to hear that and that know that that's important. And so as staff, as we go through our selection process, we definitely, you know, we'll keep that in mind that this is we're looking for somebody that really can embody who we are as a city and not just create a sign and walk away, but rather somebody that really understands this that we will certainly be looking for that. And that kind of input is helpful as we go through that, that interview process and brings forward a recommendation to the City Council. And have we identified a funding source for the actual gateway signs at this point or no? So in the city manager's recommended budget to the council, the mayor and council that was adopted, there was a $400,000 item for this, for it would it would be for the study and for the implementation. And so we don't have a cost yet for what the study would cost versus the versus the full implementation. And then we would be looking for some tidelands funds to be able to do the beaches and some of the parking funds for the parking study and the components. So that'll be part of our recommendation. When we come back is what are the different funding sources, what is the cost of the RFP? And we want to be able to do it in phases if if something is is bid and it's too high and we don't have the funds to do that, we would certainly go back and and try to negotiate something that's a little bit more palatable and and within our means. And if you could just remind me, I think when we were talking about the Gateway signage item, we were talking about signage at the gateway to the city from other cities. So where we border with another city, making it very clear that they've now entered the city of Long Beach and having some sort of a consistent signage throughout the city that indicates to the person that's driving into the city that they've now entered a new city. And that's what we're talking about when we're talking about gateway signage. Yes, that's correct. We've done a survey in off the top of my head. I believe it's about 27 sites that we've already identified. And we do have some signage out there already. So we do have signage that we've done in the past. We're looking to refresh that, to have a new image, to look at those sites, but then also to look at other sites that potentially have been missed or haven't had those improvements and get an inventory of what kinds of signs can go there. There is there's Caltrans rules, for example, on what types of signs can go where and what types and what monuments. And there's lots of different components, lighting, you know, what they should look like, how they should look like. So that's part of the effort that'll that the firm help us with. And what about branding? What are the signs going to say? Because I know in the third district they say we're the aquatic capital of the world right now. They say a lot of things. We have a number of different signs. And in the past, it's it's really been based on funding source rather than a consistent methodology. So we do have one or two that say aquatics capital of America, because they helped pay for those. Yes, we do have some that say the most bike friendly city because those were paid for by bike dollars. And that was part of our bike bike branding. We do have the international city is that we were the international city. We are the international city. So part of our charge to the consultant is look at and it's a it's different than a branding exercise that by itself can be several million dollars to create one brand for the city. But it's try to get a consistent feel and look and also look at those slogans. Should we have a slogan? If we do, what should it be? Should there not be a slogan? I look at best practices for these types of signs and give us some some examples of what the what that final word product could be . And is that going to involve any sort of community outreach? Because I can tell you that aquatics capital of America, as well as probably other organizations, are going to want to be involved in providing some input in regards to whether or not there are slogans and where those are place. So what kind of community outreach are we envisioning for this process. As we haven't gotten quite to that level of detail yet. We want to see what they're proposing and building through the process, but we can certainly look at some type of input, whether it's in meetings or whether it's some type of online input or some gathering. Part of their charge is going to be to look at all of the different ways that we brand ourselves. So there are lots of different stakeholders. There's Aquatics, Captain America, CVB has a very big interest in this, the DOJ and the downtown. Our beach groups are going to be very interested, so we want to basically get some information on kind of what what is important, but then really trust kind of this team who does this to try to figure out how to how to best give us a brand or assign a not a brand, but a sign that kind of reflects who we are as a community and and then know bring that, that recommendation. Great. Thank you. Councilwoman Mongo. As I appreciate the thorough staff report. Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Yes. Thank you for a lot of your questions, Councilman Price, and for bringing this forward. I, too, would like to, you know, just hear more information as we get closer to these seven potential business owners to see what type of branding. I know in the downtown area, we are creating a brand new sign that will be installed in May. So I'm wondering how that also affects branding in and around the city, and I'm sure that will be incorporated. Is that correct? So that design is actually still moving forward. And so that's kind of designed I think part of their challenge is going to be to look at things that are already existing like that sign and and find a way to get something that unifies a lot of those. So it may not be the exact sign because if we just picked one, you know that there's so many different things that that that show who we are as a community. But I think their challenge will be to look at all those existing things that when we do something in an uptown, we do something on Pine Avenue , kind of take the best elements and try to create something that, you know, that clearly says this is Long Beach when when you see that sign. Okay, great. And then I think on my other questions were answered. But final question is how much emphasis did we put on local businesses ensuring that, you know, someone? I think there was an agenda item we put forward. Well, Councilman Price may have put forward some time ago. And I had emphasized, especially when we go out to RFP, you know, creating some sort of local components and show we're getting that that business. So we do recognize that we have a lot of talent in our city. And so whenever we do have RFP is we we not only encourage people to sign up with RFP, but we also have a specific outreach to local firms. And so when the council letter comes back, whoever the item is that was selected, we will definitely make a point of showing, you know, what we did for that kind of local outreach to make sure that we've got that we at least made sure that everyone was aware of what we were doing before they before they had a chance to decide if they wanted to submit or not. Okay. Thank you. Council member your income. Many years ago when we created these gateways. Signage. Um. Um. Items that are out there. I was part of a committee at that time. I think it was put together by the by the Chamber of Commerce. They I was president of the Hispanic businesses at the time, so I was invited to participate in a review of of what types of signage we wanted to to create. And so I was I was a participant in that. And it was quite, quite a good process in terms of being able to review the types of signage that we wanted to come up with and create and then had a saying adopt it. So I do encourage the the participation of a lot of people out there who might be interested in in seeing what type of signage is being proposed and what type of signage we want. But I'm not sure at that time because obviously I was not on the city council this back in his mid-eighties or so early nineties when we did this. If the city council got an opportunity to review what the program was going to look like, I certainly would like to have that opportunity to review what's what's being proposed and perhaps have some input. When obviously, when I was a member of the Board of trustees, along with City College, we went through the same thing. We looked at different types of designs and different project. It was more of the branding type of effort at that point. But the board did review and look at different proposal, different propositions or proposals out there in terms of what would be. That would fit the vision and the mission of the college as well as as the trustees of what they wanted to see. So I would I would want to at least if if not a public display of what works or what might not work, maybe an opportunity for the city council to review what's out there, because it will be signage that's going to last for quite some time anyway after I'm gone and people are going to look at that . So it's going to be iconic. I would think I would want it to be anyway. So if we can have some kind of methodology to participate in that process, I would really welcome that as well. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Richardson. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. Tom, is there is there a way that our business districts can sort of piggyback on this and, you know, if they want to, for example, the Uptown Business District has been working for a while on a wayfinding sign concept for the Atlantic corridor. And it seems to me if the city is doing the same thing, maybe our business district can save a little money and maybe, you know, piggyback on this consultant and work out something else. Is it is is anything like that possible or can that be arranged? So I think we very much agree with that, is that we would want if somebody else in our city wants to use this service, whoever it is that we end up picking, that there are would not only be economies of scale, but I think it would also make creative and artistic sense so that we don't have someone starting with a completely different sign in one area. Even if it's not a city sign, we'd like them to to speak to that. So we'll be definitely as we go through the process of selecting somebody, asking them about that and if there's somebody ready to go right now, they can you know, they can talk to them. And if not, I think we'd encourage the firm to be open to, you know, seeing that this could be a larger effort. And my guess is most firms would be very open to that because it means additional work for them and and give a good price. Kate, thank you. Public comment on this item. Well, good evening again, Mayor. City Council. My name's Gary Shelton. I'm here representing West Gateway Community Association and other folks in the neighborhood that I live in. I need to throw myself at your feet in an act of contrition, because I do not know anything about the April 21st motion or action that was taken by city council to put this into into motion. I can see, or at least I glean from the staff report, that the August 10th memo was a to or from or whatever you call those things that that we typically don't see out here in the public. And so this has gotten to the point where I believe in understanding some of the conversation that the business community, one or two, at least neighborhood communities who have been working on signage for some time may be at the point where they need to say, Hey, we've done a lot of work on this. Can our design be included in this somehow? Can you include can we include you in our design? Something like that. There's been some hiccup, perhaps in public awareness of what's going on, but here we are today and that's just fine. One of the things I mentioned, West Gateway Community Association. I wanted to let you know that we have and we're very proud of our our new and it's proprietary our new logo. And I think you might recognize some of the imagery on it. We're the West Gateway to downtown Long Beach and have been recognized by the downtown Long Beach Associates. That neighborhood called West Gateway for quite some time. Sometimes it's confused with West End, but it's West Gateway. Nevertheless, we're one of the 27, I assume, areas which do have current existing signage. We have some signage up across the street from the courthouse on Broadway and so on. And I would recommend or would have recommended had we had the opportunity. And maybe now is the time. The only time I have to suggest that neighborhood logos such as ours could be included on the citywide branding, something like Welcome to Long Beach, the International City. You've arrived to West Gateway or something of that nature. The reason I suggest that is because we all have done so much work. We all do identify closely with our neighborhoods in the city and would really appreciate the opportunity to go forward even early on in this process. It seems like there's evidently seven responses to the RFP that have been received but not looked at. Mr. Modica suggested he didn't know if they were bidding on one, two or all three of the components. The gateway component is the one that we're most interested in. Thank you and appreciate any way you can come back to us for our additional feedback. Any other public comment, please come forward. Or you do click as the address. I want to again suggest, but when this did first come up that we take a look at it and a paradigm that would come with some funding from the state and the feds. These are the is the roundabout or traffic circle, which, as I pointed out at the time. Is has really a very interesting and you should Google it if people have not done a Google roundabout or Long Beach traffic circle and that we could get state and federal monies, I believe on that. I've already talked to the state. We can certainly get some city state money on it. That has a link to a direct link to a federal highway called Route six, which prior to for the two thirds of the first century, was the major East-West route. It had a auspicious name, I think. Grand Army of the Republic, because it was used by the Union Army during the Civil War. And at the end of that route, sex is at the end of Cape Cod. And if you go Google it, you'll see there's a sign there that says references route sex and it's historic aspect and says it's 363,652 miles west to Long Beach, California. And it's got the sign of that was paid for by the feds or the the historic society and on the in. Massachusetts. So I think those federal funds are there and also the state funds. And that also would tie in to this cannon that's been floating around. It's connected to the Civil War. Another suggestion, sort of. Off the wall. That would go set national if not international recognition, recognition on the side. Long Beach, California. We're bankrupt. We need your money. Please come spend. Bail us out. Something along the lines of take it to the comic level. Although. It certainly isn't a you know, it's the truth. Tell the truth. We put that out there, see what the reaction is. We'd certainly get media attention. Think. Any other suggestions or comment on this item saying Nonmembers, please cast your votes. Motion carries.

Please close voting. Announce the results. 1212 I Council will 19 US 0055 has passed. Desmond Brooks, will you please put Council Bill 79 on the floor? Yes. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that council bill 79 be placed upon the upon final consideration to pass. It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for council will 19 0079 is open. May we have the staff report? Thank you. Good evening. I'm Courtney Livingston with Community Planning and Development. This application is a request to rezone property at 901 Irving Street in Council District three in the Villa Park statistical neighborhood at the northwest corner of Irving and Ninth Avenue. The proposal to rezone two Eastside one is to allow for an accessory dwelling unit. The current district, the IS ESD and the ESU d one district allows for ADAS use sites with a 6000 square foot minimum existing zoning. The current subject property is zoned Eastside and the surrounding properties are also zoned Eastside. We do have a bit of Eastside one to the west starting at the alley in between King Street and Linden Court and the existing land use. Currently the subject property is use single use residential and there is a good abundance of single unit residential surrounding. There is some two unit and multi-unit residential interspersed to the west and north. There's also Eagleton Elementary School, just to the southwest. So here are some photos of the site North taken from Irving Street in the south is the view from West Ninth Avenue. These are additional photos of the surrounding contract context. The yellow arrows indicate the subject property. In terms of process, the sub, the application was noticed according to code requirements. The Villa Park R.A. voted to approve the rezoning and provided the form in that is attached to your staff report. Review Criteria. There are five review criteria that we review applications against for consistency. The first one is consistency with adopted plans. There are four adopted plans that we have that apply to this property. The Comprehensive Plan 2000 Blueprint. Denver. The Villa Park Plan and Housing Inclusive Denver. First, the Comprehensive Plan 2000 there are. That's a citywide vision and there are a number of strategies from the comprehensive plan that we found the application is consistent with. Secondly, we're looking at Blueprint Denver that was adopted in 2002 and sets a city wide integrated land use and transportation vision. The area is shown as having a concept. Land use of single family residential single family homes are the predominant residential types and densities are fewer than ten to use per acre. ADAS are recommended in Blueprint 22 in residential areas. The subject property is also in an area stability. The goal of area stability is to maintain the character while accommodating some new development in the three classifications. Both Irving and West Ninth are both on designated locals. Those are tailored to provide local access rather than through movements. We reviewed the rezoning application and found that was consistent with with Blueprint Denver recommendations as the addition of an 80 U provides for small scale compatible infill improvements in density and maintains the overall character of the neighborhood. Next, we'll move to the Villa Park plan that was adopted by council in 1991. There are various strategies to discourage development that is incompatible with the scale and quality of the neighborhood and has a housing vision of sound management and a mix of income levels in. Excuse me. Sorry. In rental single family homes and apartments, the proposed district helps protect residential character in the compatible low skill residential district and allows for reasonable small scale increase in density while creating additional quality housing stock, supporting affordability and contributing to a of income levels, which is consistent with the Ville Park Plan recommendations and in housing the inclusive Denver that was adopted in 2018. The plan recommends expanding the development of Adus as they incentivize affordable and mixed income housing and also promotes the development to use as a wealth building tool for low and moderate income homeowners. The proposed MAP amendment is consistent with these recommendations, as will expand the availability and allow for the development of an accessory dwelling unit. The next two criteria Uniformity of district regulations. We've reviewed the criteria, and the proposed rezoning will result in uniform application of the ESU, D1 zoned district, and it will further public health, safety and welfare , primarily through the adoption of implementing plans. And it also recommends preserving the character of Denver's existing neighborhoods while allowing for some small scale reinvestment for justifying circumstances. There has been change in the area and the city adopted the Housing Inclusive Denver plan. And that plan notes the the cost of living has outpaced incomes creating affordable housing shortage. It specifically calls out the Villa Park neighborhood and notes that there's been a 30% increase in assessed property values over the last two assessment cycles, some of the highest in Denver. While housing affordability is a citywide challenge impacting Villa Park and other neighborhoods, there's documented increases in this neighborhood specifically, and this changing condition helps justify the rezoning to allow an ADU, which is an affordability strategy. But on top of that, there has been a lot of physical changes which also justify the rezoning for the criteria. Two new light rail stations on the alliance. We have the NOx indicator stations which are less than a half a mile from the subject property of the Federal Boulevard Improvement Projects. So those are the safe, the pedestrian safety improvements. And then in 2018 we saw the opening of Denver Parks and Recreation's Reimagined playground at Paco Sanchez Park. That's a regional scale playground, and that's less than a half a mile from the subject property. So there's been a lot of physical changes that justify this rezoning in terms of the last review criteria, consistency with neighborhood context. So in district perfect purpose and in statements, the subject property is in the urban edge neighborhood context. That is a mix of the urban and suburban neighborhoods. The urban edge neighborhood context consists of single and two unit residential units. Buildings are generally low in scale and the intent of the Eastside one district is a single unit district allowing only urban houses and detached accessory dwelling units with a minimum zone lot area of 6000 square feet. This meets that requirement. In conclusion, CPD recommends approval of this rezoning, finding that all review criteria have been met. Thank you. Thank you very much. We have three people signed up to speak this evening. First up is Ryan Parish. Hello. My name is Ryan British. Myself and my wife are the owners of the property and the applicants for the zoning change. Thank you very much for considering it. Didn't really have too much to say. It was more so if you guys have any specific questions. One thing that I will add is the ADU that if our zoning change is approved, we would be building it as a passive ADU, so it would be as environmentally friendly as possible, hopefully producing more energy than than we'd be using. Thank you. Next up, Jesse Paris. Jesse Pierce represented for Denver Home a sellout Black Star action moment for self defense and Positive Action Commitment for Social Change now reside at Albert Brooks District of District nine, and I am at top of the ballot for at large for the May 2019 election. I was against this. But after further deliberation, I'm actually in favor of this rezoning for a sensible dwelling unit. We have a housing crisis, so the more homeowners can offer their spaces up for accessible dwelling units, that might actually put a dent in this crisis, since the current council does not care one bit about it. So we're in favor of this. Thank you. Thank you. And next up, Nicole Bush. I'm Nicole Barrish. I'm also the owner of the home with Ryan and Joanie back there. And I also don't have much to say. Just wanted to ask if you have any questions we're here to answer. Thank you. Thank you very much. That concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of Council on this one? Guzman-Lopez Yeah, really quick, Nicole, if you can, you can come to the microphone real quick. Are you where is the front door facing on the 80? Towards the alley or towards the, the, the street side basically. For the our current house. Yeah. Street side. Okay. So in the 80 you if you were to build the idea is that a garage conversion or are you building straight up from the ground up? Straight from the ground up? Are you is it facing the alley? No. So the front door would face 10/69 Street. Okay. And that's all I wanted to say. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Councilman Lopez, seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 79 is closed. Other comments by members of Council Councilor Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. You know, this is a this is an area where, to be quite honest, a lot of abuse exists without proper zoning or designation. And there some of them are some of are there because they are converted garages. This area in 2010 when we did the citywide rezoning was an area that I think in some places was are two, in some places are one. And in when we had the conversations in a community. Sorry. What do you know about Notorious B.I.G. Just kidding. I don't like it. I've seen it in the. In this area. It's an area that I think a lot of folks have really been looking at. Designating free to use, as a matter of fact. The old ah. The old ah. One area is adu accessible. There's a lot of places where it kind of cuts in. And now in the more and more we have conversations with folks in the neighborhood, these are lots that are pretty big. These are homes that are relatively small for the main the main home. And then and they do make sense. So it's unfortunate that you had to come to council to actually reason for the to you and hopefully with with a new update. And this is something that we've been considering in the new update and folks have been chiming in and I hope you all do the same thing, is that throughout these areas that are just within a stone throws distance to each light rail station on Federal Boulevard in Knox cor even on a Perry in some of these areas and be a park they should all be if there's enough space on the property they should all be of use or at least eligible for a to use. So and that's another way to create affordable housing, right? So with that, I mean, I, I don't see why we would oppose this. It, it meets all the criteria. It's so close to the, to the area. And also it's my neighborhood, too. So it I drive it every single day. I'm very familiar. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilman Brooks. Yeah. I think this meets all the criteria and I'll be supporting it. I just want to make a couple statements real quick. Number one, it's amazing to have your young child in here. So even though they're crying, I just think it's awesome to have young constituents to a to use are incredibly important cities are doing innovative initiatives like waiving tap fees CPD you know to make it easier for residents to build a to use for an incentive to offer a matter of affordable price. And so I think we need to do much more as a city. It's really interesting reading other what other cities are doing all over the country to make it incentive based to do this. But I think we also need to be careful because we don't want all of our aid used to be short term rentals, right? We do want them to be used at an affordable level. And so really glad that you guys are doing this. And I guess this is more of a signal to CBD that, you know, I want to work with you all on. I want to see some innovative steps for us to allow this to be done. There are many people in my district and throughout the city who pay a lot of money to get an ADU, and most people don't do it because there's so many hoops to jump through. So I'll be supporting this. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilwoman Ortega. Mr. President, I think we have a new community activist in the room, and I didn't hear her crying. I heard her wanting to make sure her voice was being heard. Right. So that's what I heard her chiming in saying, yes, we need this for my neighbor. Anyway, I just want to say that we are hearing this conversation all across the city, not just in one community, about the the desire to have the opportunity where a lot has the space and can accommodate an additional attached dwelling unit to be able to do that. We have lots of families in our city where, you know, people are doubling and tripling up in terms of family size. You got three generations living in one household, number one, because of the cost. And number two, just a lot of it's very cultural and it's a way for people to be able to afford to live close together. You know, it's a great way to make sure you've got your support system close by, especially when you have small children. I know my mom lived close to me when I was raising my daughter as a single mom, and I couldn't have done it without her. So I think that the more we can look at this word, they're not having to be brought forward as a one off in every, you know, location. It gets very costly. But where we can look at doing this across the board and and look at where that need exists, I think we should be doing that. And. Working with our planning department to make that happen. So I'll be supporting this tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Ortega. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President, on this. I had to smile this morning when I was going over these hearings for tonight's theme to accessory dwelling units. On the same night in two different neighborhoods and just had to take the opportunity to bring up the name of your constituent, your late constituent, my friend Bob Sperling, who was a community activist who for years was screaming into the darkness about the importance of aid use in Denver and couldn't get an ear. And I firmly believe he was played an important role in the fact that your family will have the opportunity to to build that atyou you as with Mr. Falco who before. So I just wanted to say how happy I am I think to use one sided properly are as such a critical part of us answering the housing crisis in Denver. So I'll be looking forward to voting I on this one. Thank you, Councilman Cashman. And you're right, a great night to remember Bob Sperling, who is well ahead of the curve on this and many things. So with that, Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 19 0079. Lopez Hi. Black Eye. Brooks Hi. Flynn Hi. Gilmore I heard it. Hi. Cashman. Hi. Can each. I knew Ortega by assessment. All right. Mr. President. I am secretary. Please close the voting. Announce the results. 12 hours, 12 hours. Council Bill 19 0079 has passed.

Council President Steve Nally with community planning and development. We are now shifting gears and heading north in the neighborhood up to the Potter Highlands area. This is both a text and a map amendment for the Potter Highlands conservation overlay. So the intent of this overlay, similar to the other one, is to really reflect that 19th century, late 19th century character of the Potter Highlands. This image reflects the the type of homes that you'll find in Potter Highlands, where they're one and a half stories and they have side facing Dormers. And there are other types of kind of high style homes found in Potter Highlands. And but this is the predominant character, and the overlay reflects this character. So it's a very similar process to actually the same process as the other overlay. So I won't go through all the details, but I will say that public notification for planning board was sent to all Arnaud's and all council members and signs were posted throughout the Map Amendment area and then also for City Council. Public notification was sent to all our knows and to all city councils and signs where new signs were posted throughout the neighborhood, noticing that the public hearing was going to be held tonight. So the tech summit creating the CEO for the conservation overlay for there's a lot of detail in this conservation overlay for primary building form standards . There's a five foot minimum side interior set back for lots greater than 30 feet in width as opposed to a three feet on one side or ten foot combined. Also, the proposed language reduces the bulk height calibrated to the zone lot with. So instead of a 17 foot vertical bulk plain height before you have your spring point and go at an angle. And so instead of that 17 foot vertical boat point height, it plots 30 feet or less and with heavy 15 foot pole, clean height and lots greater than 30 feet in width have a 13 foot real voids . And the intent is to reduce the overall height allowed by the base zoning rooftop decks under the current zoning without the overlay are allowed on the on the top of any roof up to that second and a half storey. So this language would limit the rooftop decks to the roof of the ground storey so you could have it on the roof of the first floor. You could walk out from your second floor onto the ground. Storey I mean, it's limited to just the roof, the ground, sorry, and also limited. And this is by the basement district within that front, 65% flat roof structures. And these are found throughout the neighborhood. The historic oftentimes they're duplexes, but sometimes they're also single family where it's a flat roof structure. They don't sculpt at the bulk plan. So this overlay would limit the overall height of a flat roof structure to 25 feet. However, that structure would not be subject to the bulk plan. It could go straight up at the site. There's another book playing exception, and that's to allow side facing dormers. There are multiple limit limitations within the language, so the side facing dormer would be allowed to pierce that ball playing that it's coming in at an angle from both sides. And then for two unit dwelling users must have a minimum zone, lot of 5500 square feet and 50 feet of width, as opposed to the underlying zone district , which allows a 40 foot 500 square feet and 35 feet. So this is a lot of the duplexes, the majority of the duplexes in the neighborhood are found on larger lots. And so it's reflecting that character that exists. And then the detached accessory dwelling unit is similar to the previous overlay, but it's allowing a zero foot side interior setback to match the garage or other detached accessory structures. So the review criteria in the different zoning code for a conservation overlay and specifically a text amendment is found in section 943 to see. Also, Tex amendments must be consistent with adopted plans for the public health and safety of the general welfare and resulting regulations that are uniform within each zone district. So the proposed Potter Highland Conservation Overlay seal for create size, scale and mass standards to be more consistent with the existing and distinct building features by requiring a reduced size , scale and mass than the standards of the underlying zone district. There are three plans that apply COP21 blueprint Denver and the Highland Neighborhood Plan. Very similar recommendations. This is the previous overlay, but really trying to be consistent or right zoning and have zoning standards that are consistent with the character of the neighborhood. So the proposed section is consistent with many of the planning goals, the proposed six amendments, consistent with many blueprint Denver strategies, including the concept land use, which is single family and single family duplex area of stability. The proposed standards would further stabilize and meet the goals of Blueprint. Denver The Highland Neighborhood Plan process is consistent with the whole neighborhood plan strategies, including heightening the sense of neighborhood pride and revitalizing the housing stock and maintaining and stabilizing the character of the neighborhood. This tax amendment furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents as it provides for context sensitive and character reinforcing standards that further stabilize the established neighborhood. And this text amendment result will result in uniform regulations applicable to all new buildings within land mapped C0 four. So based on that, CB recommends approval, a finding that all criteria have been met. Now shifting to the MAP amendment, we are still in the Highland neighborhood and still in Council District nine, located in the Potter Highland area. There are few portions of the proposed area to be risen that are outside of the historic district. However, the majority that falls within that historic district in the zone districts to be re zoned or YouTube YouTube and a YouTube with you oh three which the use overlay so the review criteria and the zoning code for a map amendment any conservation overlay that the proposed water highland conservation overlay see or for create size, scale and map standards be more consistent with the existing existing building features by requiring a reduced size, scale and asset than the standards of the underlying zone districts. The proposed text amendment is consistent with Section 943 to see the three plans that apply to the site. The proposed MAP amendment is consistent with many compelling 2000 goals, including encouraging quality infill development that is consistent with the character of the neighborhood. Proposed map permit is consistent with many blueprint Denver strategies, including the concept land use, single family, single family duplex area of stability and the proposed map amendment is consistent with many Highland neighborhood plan strategies, including maintaining and stabilizing the character of the neighborhood. Here's the map. A blueprint majority of the Highlands area or the area to be zoned is in single family residential with the area to the southeast single family duplex. This map will result in uniform regulations applicable to all new buildings within land mapped C0 four. And this map furthers the public health, safety and general welfare of Denver residents as it provides for context sensitive and character reinforcing standards that further stabilize the established neighborhood. So CPD recommends approval based on finding that all criteria have been met. Thanks. Thank you. We have five speakers for 319 as amended or 3.1. I will call off five. You please feel free to make your way to the front pew Dick Farley, Mary Broderick, Jerry Gold Timbers and Brian Shirk Pinnick. I apologize if I mispronounced that, but you can make your way to the front pew. And, Mr. Farley, you can begin your comment. Thank you. Mr. President, members of council. My name is Richard Farley. I live at 2500 Walnut Street in Denver. I helped craft the the Potter Highlands overlay zone. It addresses the unforeseen consequence of a small third story and deck being fitted underneath the existing single family and duplex bulk planes. This results in a building type that is foreign to the neighborhood, both in form and in the encouragement of a second level and second level decks, which negatively affect privacy. The proposed overlay zone pulls the bulk plane down. While at the same time allows Dormers to penetrate the bulk plane. To maximize the usable second floor area. The Dormers also provide daylight into the second floor. In addition, they are found throughout the Potter Highlands neighborhood. Flat roof duplexes and houses are also found throughout the neighborhood. This overlay zone allows the full two storey houses and duplexes to occur without the ball playing, so long as they are limited to 25 feet in height. I believe that the Neighborhood Planning and Community Development Committee has worked hard to accommodate two storey houses and duplexes while eliminating three storey form, which is out of character with the neighborhood. I support this overlay zone and urge your approval. Thank you. Thank you, Mary Broderick. Hi, I'm Mary Broderick and I live at 2636 West 35th Avenue in Potter Highland. I moved into Potter Highlands in 1981 and bought my first house. I now live two houses away. I want to say I'm conflicted here because the overall work that Honey has done, CPD has done is really good for the neighborhood. The only issue that I'm having is the move from the combined side interior, which was a combined of ten feet, so that if you had seven foot, eight or seven foot on one side, you could have three foot on the other side for that combined ten and four lots like mine that are 30 a lot and a half, 38 feet wide. When you're building a potential addition, for instance, you can't line up with the existing building. They want some level of offset to show that it's it's an addition. At least Landmark has. Told me that. So what ends up happening is that you start fighting over to that side interior. So having the five foot requirement on both sides. In my particular situation, it was better to go with the combined setback. But so I really don't want this to sound like I'm opposing all the incredible work that's been done, but maybe offer a situation other than a variance. Because here's an example. My original house was 600 square feet and it was bounded by the East Valley. A developer bought it from the guy that I sold it to. And he. Was able to get a zero clearance right up against the alley. And he built this. Huge pop top, which was totally I mean, it's okay. But I guess my. Point is, is that. I think this is really good work. These design overlays, the conservation overlays are important. But if people can bypass it through a variance, then we're losing the work, all the work that you've done. And it seems to me. Sometimes that the developers know all the tricks and can afford to, you know, to file for those variances. So just some thoughts to consider. My biggest issue is, is maybe there's a way to grandfather the side. So that if you're in. The process and you already had drawings or whatever. That there. Might be some way to allow the combined. Set back to sunset. In six months or a year or something like that. So granted, this is a very selfish comment here, and I do agree with most all of the work that's been done. And I miss Broderick, I apologize. You 3 minutes is up. Thank you, Jerry Gold. Hi. My name is Jerry Gold and I live at. 2935 West 36th Avenue, once. In the Potter Highlands, and it's on the corner of West. 36th and federal. My partner and I, Frank, have lived in that house for 39 years. And we were privileged to be. Part of the original Potter Islands. Association that eventually, after we had moved in, got Potter Highlands designated as historic. And so it's always been so important to us what happens to that neighborhood. And we were very involved, both politically and socially for the first couple of years. Then we adopted four children and we kind of stepped aside for quite a few years, as most parents might understand. And just recently, though, our kids are somewhat on their own and I'm retired and I've jumped back in because we've had so many concerns about what is happening in the neighborhood. Our house, during those years that we had the kids, we still did a lot of work. We built a garage. We added a porch. We added a den on the back. 12 years ago, we had a. Third story attic that we remodeled and we got dormers because we had a variance. And that went really well. And all the time we did it. We were always so conscious of the character of the house and it was so important to us to do that. And our hope has always been that everybody else would do that. What's a bit scary now is, as you know, east of us in from Potter Highlands, the the building is becoming. Tremendous modern structures. That don't fit into our neighborhood. And as some of you know, some of them have over the past two years. And that is why people have become so concerned. And I think the overlays which I support completely are going to help people who are trying to remodel but want to do it in the character of the neighborhood and their house. But it will stop people from doing stuff that they shouldn't do. At least it will help in remodeling. It will also, I think, give direction to the people that want to come in. Not that they're scraping all of our houses, but any vacant lot. The corporations or the construction people are very excited about building in our neighborhood. And often, as some of you know, their modern boxes, it just don't fit in. And so our hope is with the overlays that we can control that and give them direction, but also keep them from destroying the character of our neighborhood. I support it completely. Thanks. Thank you, Timbers. Good evening. Tim verse 25, 58 West 32nd Avenue. Here to speak now about the Potter Highlands portion of the the overlays with we went through the same process here. I would say the biggest difference in the process for Potter Highlands was that midway through our journey, neighbors like Jerry and many others were becoming alarmed at what was going on with infill development within Potter Highlands and came to us and said, You've got to help, you've got to do something. Are the overlays going to help us? And we looked at the overlays we were thinking about at that time, said, Gee, these aren't doing everything they could do. And at the same time, the Landmark Preservation Commission of the city was developing new guidelines, updated guidelines, specifically district by district. And so we were able to see what they were coming up with and recognize where the current zoning code doesn't really coincide very well with the guidelines. And that's where a lot of the conflict was happening in Potter Highlands. And so what we've developed here and what you see tonight is really a great stride forward in getting the zoning to match up with Landmark so that those two entities within the city government can actually be working in the same direction instead of at odds with one another, as has sometimes occurred in the past. So I think that's really important. And I think you should also note that there are neighbors in Potter Highlands that have gone to great lengths way beyond what our committee could do, looking for what are the patterns that are typical in Potter Highlands. And the one that I would cite is the size of lots. The duplexes are go on. One of our neighbors spent I don't know how many days, but walked every face block twice looking for the duplexes and then mapping where they were in terms of the width of lots and prove to us because we asked him to that 75% of the duplexes, historic duplexes in Potter Highlands are on larger lots on a double lot. And so that's that's why you see this in here. We're able to support that with with real data. I think that's about all I need to say here. Obviously, I'm speaking in support. Thank you. Thank you. Brian Sicknick. Hi. I'm Brian Sicknick. I've lived at 2605 West 35th Avenue for the past two years, but I've been in the Highland neighborhood for five years now. I'm the current honey president. Just took over from Rebecca Hunt this year. I've sat on the board for the last four years, though, um, before I even started on the board. I actually attended one of these Pcdi meetings, the timbers ran, and the overlay discussion was one of those topics at that point, and the amount of detail that they went through to map this neighborhood and to figure out exactly what, what what really needed to happen to keep the character is really overwhelming that the pride that they have in the neighborhood is is something that we all really, really have to appreciate. And that word character has come up multiple times. You walk around that neighborhood and people people love it. People who visit us say what a beautiful neighborhood this is. And it's because of that character that that really makes it that way. You know, I. I plan to stay in the neighborhood. I plan to raise a family in the neighborhood. And I just wanted to see it remain the same. Remain a gem of Denver. So thank you. Thank you. And that concludes our speakers. Time for questions. Any questions from members of Council Councilman Moran? Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. I was thinking about the duplex piece that Tim addressed, and so I'm glad you addressed it, because I was thinking we talked a lot about how many units you can get on the various width of what during the zoning code update process, as you probably remember. And I'm thinking about the rest of the city. I don't know, Steve, if you can answer this, but I think it would be pretty common to say that the majority of 50 foot lots are two unit multi-unit. You know, with the flat roof rather than the three unit. I mean, how did we get to that? And is it something we should be looking at citywide? I'm just. You know, I think the the Potter Highlands, the characters, typically, you have this side by side duplexes. Sometimes they're they're stacked. But when you have the side by side, they're often on 50 foot lots throughout Denver. I think the duplex is a result of duplexes and triplexes as a result of our two zoning. The more land you have, the more units you could build. Our two is not just the two unit. And so it's an interesting question, having given a much thought as far as looking at this citywide and getting a sense of, you know, if duplexes are on larger lots, but there are areas of the city where we're encouraging more density and we're encouraging, you know, stacking. Yeah. So let me let me angle the question a little bit differently. I was thinking about that. I was thinking about the cost of housing in Denver right now, the cost of rentals or for sale, and that people are living in smaller and smaller spaces. And so I was thinking, should we be doing this? I guess one of the questions I have are a lot of the I mean, are our buildings being scraped over there or are these only vacant lots where we're trying to prevent this happening? I know it's landmarked, so I don't know how often a building is scraped. Tim, do you I mean, Tim, if you want to take a stab at being scraped. Yeah. Okay. How did they get scraped under Landmark? Is it easy? Potter Highlands is an interesting neighborhood in that portion of our neighborhood in that the development has happened over the last 140 years, and yet the Landmark District only recognizes houses as being historic up through 1943, I believe it is. And so anything newer than that, and there's a fair amount of housing stock that's been built since. Under the R2 zoning. It's not contributor. We have we have nine contributing what are considered non contributing structures. So there are duplexes and multiple unit terrace kinds of housing built in the fifties and sixties and those are being scraped just as fast as people can get the certificate of Noncommercial Conformance. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Robb. Councilman Monteiro. Thank you, Mr. President. Steve, can you come up to the podium? There you are and address Ms.. Broad Rick's concerns? Sure. So it's actually an interesting question. And Ms.. Browder was not the only one to bring up the topic as we work through the conservation overlay, specifically around shifting from a three or ten foot combines interior to five and five because, you know, there are the structures that exist in the neighborhood that may have that three foot on one side. So there is an administrative adjustment process and this is new to the Denver zoning code. It did not exist in the previous code previously. You'd have to go to the board for any adjustment. The administrative adjustment allows for the zoning administrator. If there's a finding that it's compatible with the neighborhood, that there is an adjustment that can be made for the 31 to 44. Lots related to the site interior setback. So I can only encourage Ms.. Bruder to submit plans, and we can start that conversation as to how to utilize that administrative adjustment. But that's different than the variance that Mr. was. Asking for, right? So a variance you'd have to go to the Board of Adjustment and approve a hardship. And the administrative adjustment is takes place administratively through the zoning administrator. And you don't have to go to the Board of adjustment. Okay. One more question, Mr. President. This is for Mr. Gold. Come up to the podium, please. Thank you for working on the designation of the Potter Highland Historic District. I lived there for quite some time and enjoyed it very much. I wanted to I wanted to ask you, at what point did you get involved with this whole process, with the text amendments and the map amendments, especially for Potter Highlands? Well, we moved in in 76 and started working on the house right away, and we had no kids then. And then the people that were part of the original association were starting to work on getting it designated. And I believe the year was 87 that it finally happened. And so we got really pulled in with that and in helping going around the neighborhood, talking to people and I can't say at all that we were the ones that did all the work, but we got involved then. And of course, as I said, working on our own house and everybody was concerned about their own houses at that time. And so then it became very social. And the the neighborhood did a lot of things to support its designation with all kinds of parties. And, and we had. Tours and stuff like that. So that's when we really got involved. And then I dropped out for a while. And then some of my neighbors, in a sense got me involved again recently. So maybe, maybe between you and Tim, you can answer this for me. But as we were going through this legislative process, Potter Highland did step up in a very vocal way, as was mentioned by by Mr. Burns. Can you just explain one more time publicly? What was it that escalated this conversation to include Potter Highland. To be better? That this is really important because we thought we were going forward and. Then we took another we took another curve because we had not covered Potter Highland. There were a number of vocal, very vocal neighbors in Potter Highlands who appeared to all of us and really raised the issues. They were they were observing new construction, things were being demolished. And, you know, 40 and 50 year old houses were coming down and being replaced by duplexes or single family houses on tighter lots than was typical. And so there was this this fear that somehow the Landmark Preservation Commission wasn't really being responsive to saving Potter Highlands and that something else had to be done. And and at first they thought we were the bad guys and we worked to convince them otherwise and then enlisted their help in figuring out what are the things that would would help and would be supportive of what Landmark Commission could be doing and how to how to save Potter Islands. And that's that's really the basis for this overlay. So is it accurate to say that basically some developers were finding loopholes in in the historic district that we had not anticipated? I think that's safe to say. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Monteiro. Captain Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. My first question is for Steve. Knowing where to go. Steve. So I guess on all of these, what would be the date that these changes would take effect? Sure. So assuming well, the Scottish village was passed, that would be effective July 10th if Potter Islands and the following are passed, it's also July 10th. Would it would be effective. Okay. My next question I'm going to ask you and Tim first to answer this question. So North Denver is a little unique because not every neighborhood in the city of Denver has carriage lots. So I'm curious how if they were looked at any differently for development within the carriage? Lots. I know we're seeing more and more of them being developed on. And I'd like to know, particularly in the Potter Highlands area, how they were dealt with. So I'm going to defer to Tim but I'll just stay. That cares less. We're not discussed or Tim did not discuss carefulness with me that much. I don't know if Tim you have something to add as to why the overlays do not address scares. Carriage lots. So you know carriage lots are a have been a quandary forever as many of us know in Potter Highlands the the carriage lots are owned by different individuals, sometimes by the city and then sold by the city to individuals. And sometimes given away to adjacent property owners. Sometimes, yes. And so we end up with some unusual lots and different sizes and shapes of lots as a result of all of that. And the zoning code doesn't really get down into the details of the shapes and sizes of lots. So we didn't find a compelling problem to try to solve on the carriage lots. But we do know that we end up seeing almost everything that goes on in carriage lots because there's always some problem to solve. But it seems to take a special case almost with each one. So Tim, I remember before the 2010 zoning code was changed, there were some changes to the old code that dealt with setbacks and mostly the side setbacks. And I remember asking the question about if somebody's home burned down and your home sits right on the zone lot. And this is very common in north Denver with homes that sit on the alleys. Does. The changes that you've made, do they look any differently at a scrape off in a rebuild versus, you know, somebody whose home may have burned down and they've got to replace part of it whether they can build back on the zero zone lot or not? You know, that's a question I think folks at the city staff would need to answer. That's kind of above my pay grade. I would hope that if my house, which is there a lot line on the side, burns down on a single lot that I could build back to that. But I think I think there being negotiations with with staff on that. Steve, do you have any insights on this one? I'm looking at Adam Hernandez. He has a code. But I think what you're talking about is involuntary demolition versus volunteer. Right. And we do have standards related to involuntary demolition. I just I'm not sure if it's related to these specific base zone districts. Yeah, I'm just I'm just curious, you know, if somebody can rebuild, if their home were to burn down or a portion of it were to burn down and they wanted to rebuild it back on that zero lot line if any of these changes prohibit that or or not. So the proposed language for the overlays has no impact on the existing language in the code related to involuntary or voluntary demolition. Okay. That's okay. Okay. That's helpful. But it would be good to know just the general answer to the question about whether someone could build on the zero light line. I think we're going to we're going to think we're going to get get back to counseling. I think what he's doing that the only other thing I wanted to know was whether or not there was any survey looking at. Maybe the number of carriage lots that have not yet been built upon. Where there's potential for more development activity on lease. So again, the carriage lots were not discussed much as part of the overlays. And so as part of this particular assignment, no, we did not do any sort of survey tied to the carriage lots. So the regular code would apply to any development that happens within those? That's correct. The based on district still applies. Okay. And I see Adam came over with the zoning code book, so I don't know if he has an answer to that question. Well, they're looking that up. Did you have another question? That was right, Councilman. Never did you want to ask a question? And we'll make sure we come back to get Councilman Ortega's question answered. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. I think my question would be pretty oh, no, it won't be brief, because Natalie is playing around with Hernandez. So it was for Mr. and Ali. We'll go ahead and ask and. I don't want to hold you up there or it may just take a second. I just wanted to close the loop on the broader question. Looks like you've been caught doing something. The the Mary Broderick question. So did you get where she was coming from and where the I mean, it's impressive that everyone here is in support of this and it makes perfect sense. But clearly the shoe pinches on her even though she's supportive of the overall enterprise. Did you understand how the shoe pinches and that her that pinch can be relieved with some administrative adjustment? That's correct. And and it's in 12, four or five of the Denver zoning code. And it's okay to administrative adjustments. For her particular issue, she was not the only one to bring it up. Okay. Got it. Great. Okay. Thank you. I feel reassured. And Steve, did you have an answer for or are we still searching? So we're still searching, but I think it's related to non-conforming structures through involuntary burns down then and it's non-conforming then. And if you're in certain commercial zone districts, I believe you can build it back as it was. But again, I'd like to look at the code to give you a specific answer. So the changes that were made before 2010, the citywide zoning code, allowed somebody to rebuild on the zero lot line. But I don't know if the 2010 code made the made changes to that. And that's what I'm trying to clarify. Yeah. And I'm sorry if I could just have some time with the code. I can give you the answer. I will say that the proposed overlays did not change any language associated with involuntary or. We don't need to hold this up. It would be helpful to get the answer to the question even after we vote on this, because actually that answer isn't going to change anything with this particular overlay. Thank you, Mr. President. Right. Any other questions on 319 as amended or re 21 scene none. Public area is now closed. Time for comments. Councilman Monteiro. Thank you, Mr. President. Again, I want to thank all of the neighbors that have come out to testify to Bill 319 and 321 as it relates to the Potter Highland Historic District. For many of us that live in northwest Denver, we've always wanted to protect and embrace Potter Highland. Even during times when it was distressed, people were working very hard and could see the the diamond in the rough. And so when this came up and people were very vocal and feeling like, if we're going to go forward with all of these changes in Highland, I was so happy that Potter Highland Historic District raised a fuss so that we could bring this forward. It is it is a historic district and it's very, very beautiful. It's got lots of queen ends and there's still some flagstone sidewalks left. And wanting to protect it is what I want to do as well. And the biggest thing is that it seems like there's a baby boom going on in Highland. And we want to be able to keep families in Highland and especially in Potter Highland historic district. And that's being able to enrich the neighborhood and allow for people to grow families. And your good example, Mr. Goal, live for kids that you raised and now they're off and maybe they'll come back to the neighborhood. But it's well worth protecting and it's well worth being able to bring this forward as a legislative sponsor so that we can begin to direct things so that they are in character with what people want in the neighborhood. So I'm very supportive and I encourage my colleagues to support me as well. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilwoman.

First, reason logically and freely through the transcript, and only then generate a concise, formal, structured legislative summary that accurately encompasses these points.",9,"Where an item number 23. And we'll take that one by itself, I believe. So why don't we read that one into the record? Agenda item 23 Accountable 119 684 Relating to taxation imposing a tax on transportation network companies. Committee recommends the bill passes amended. Okay. And this is the one I believe council members want has some has an amendment. I do have a question on not this amendment, but I can I'll ask Councilman Swan directly. Your amendments are four or four numbers, 23 and 25, but not 24. Correct. Okay. So let's take 23/1. That's been read into the record. And Councilman Swan, would you like to explain your amendment? Sure. Do you want me to do that before the description of the bill itself? So. Maybe in the bill you could sort of describe it. I wasn't prepared to. It's been sort of described a little bit. Let's see, this is let me look at your amendments. That'll give me a little. She's here. So one was just a simple language change. I think that that was the script, the name of the resolution center. Why don't you just start off with the amendment and I'll sort of chime in after, if you don't mind, because I got to get my notes together here. So let's start with number 23. So I would first move the bill to. Good guys. So the bills. It was I mean. It moved the amendment, not the bill. So cast members in and walk us through what document we are should be looking at I think it's. There should be. See we have on. Your desk that says TNC. Yeah so this is the first one is just the description of what we're calling it. Correct. And the second one is more substantive on the addition. So. Okay. So. So it's been moved counts bill 119684 is being moved. We have you should have this I have this this version which basically is section D, I think. Go ahead. Customers who want. I'm Amendment one to add a driver solidarity and resource center to the list of acceptable uses of the funds from the TNC ducks. Okay. That's the amendment as described as their second. Is there a second. Or second tier discussion? Okay. Councilmember O'Brien, second floor discussion. Go ahead, Councilmember. Sure. Thank you. As you said, President Harrell correctly, the substantive part of the amendments come into the language of the resolution. That will be item number 25. But since they're all related, I just wanted to speak once and for all and then have the points applied to item number 25 as well. Yeah, it's sort of hard. Your First Amendment supports the larger amendment, which is a more comprehensive center. So maybe what we could. Yeah, but both amendments are about that. Yeah, I understand that. So maybe just from a practical standpoint, what we can do, it's a little unorthodox, but maybe if this has legs, the name should logically change. So maybe we should just get into the substantive one and then come back and vote for the number 23 because. I'm okay with that. Are you okay? You can move to hold this item and then we can move on to item move to hold this item until after consideration of item 25. So what I was hoping to do, I can do it that way, but perhaps an easier way is just for Casper and SWAT to describe these two. And then we'll do the pro con or who likes who doesn't. And then after that transparent discussion and we'll just come back and take the votes. That's that may make sense to me at least. But does that. Is that so? Even though number 25 isn't, which is the resolution isn't introduced. We could openly talk about it because it's related to number 23. Okay. AM I'm going to go to Joe. So if I do that, you're get a. Sense the similarities but only item 23 stuff for you right now. Okay. Only one before. You. Okay. So only 23 is before me. It ties in 25. We're not going to vote on 25, but council members want maybe you could just try the whole concept which in bodies 25 but only 23 is in front of us. Yes. Okay. I can do that for sure. I think before going into the substance of my amendments, what it does. So we have item number 23, which is right now in front of us, which is the bill that establishes the the the language for how the proceeds of the tax on Uber and Lyft corporations would be used . And so we already have a possible items for which the tax revenues could be used, like administrative costs related to tax investment, affordable housing, transportation and transit investments. So there's already a, B and C, of course, which all of which I strongly support and I strongly support all the efforts by the Teamsters Union. So first thing, firstly, to clarify, this is not in in conflict with what the d what the Teamsters Union has worked on. This is in addition to soit. So this amendment of that is relevant for item number 23 would add an item D in among the list of uses for potential uses for the revenues of the tax . And that's a driver solidarity and resource center, including a driver resolution center. And the driver resolution center is already in in the original language. And then when we come to item number 25, that's a resolution. That's not the ordinance. That's a resolution to describe all the you know, what kind of eligible uses there would be for the funds generated from the transportation network company tax. And in that, the amendment goes into more detail about what does Solidarity and Resource Center, what kind of services they would provide if if we had such a center. So if I can clarify that and again, moderate, why. This. Yes, please do. Thank you. First of all, thank you so much to the Teamsters Union, everybody, all the organizers, staff, organizers and the members, both the Seattle and Bass Drivers Association, which is working more directly with the Teamsters and also the Seattle Rideshare Drivers Association, which is also associated with the Bass Drivers Association. And many of the drivers are collaborating among themselves. But there are additional points that the Right Rideshare Drivers Association wants to bring, and this is about that. It is not in any way in antagonism to the point that the Teamsters have already brought up, which we strongly support, my office strongly supports. Also, another thing I want to say at the outset is that as a union member myself and as a strong supporter of the Teamsters Union, I completely and unambiguously resist this about any anti-union sentiment or any anti Teamsters sentiment that has been that may have been brought up by certain individuals. Some of it is all from outright company, a company shills or company spokespeople, lobbyist, and sometimes they are brought up from genuine activists and workers who may have certain doubts or confusions. And I just wanted to assure everybody here and everybody who is watching or listening that this is in no way meant to and is and isn't as of, as a matter of fact, something that is antagonistic to unions. And and, in fact, I want to go even farther than that and say that all throughout history of working class people, not just in the U.S., but around the world, we have seen that without union organizing, there has been nothing that has stood for us . It's literally it's when workers got organized into unions that we were able to win even a modicum of rights in a deeply hostile and exploitative system that we live in, which is capitalism. And unions were built in this country by workers who are organizing before there was a legal right to a union, which means that many of the earliest organizers made tremendous sacrifices, sometimes through life and limb, in order for the right for future generations to have unions. And that's the kind of courage we are we stand on the shoulders of. And so we have to be very, very clear about that. The purpose of this amendment is to support the demand of hundreds of Uber and Lyft drivers for Driver Solidarity and Resource Center. And I want everybody is listening to know that the reason my office and I came to support these demands is after having doctored dozens of the 300 drivers that were reported, you know, who have signed the petition. For this, many of whom over them overwhelmingly are immigrants or even refugees from East Africa, from South Asia, from my home country, India, many of whom face systematic marginalization and oppression in our society. And that the end objective of all of this effort, whether it's what the Teamsters Union brought forward or their solidarities and resource center, all of this, I think we have a shared objective of building the power of rank and file drivers, because that is the only thing building power among the rank and file and building really strong rank and file unions. That is the only thing that can go up against the massive power of this sweatshop on wheels, which is Uber and Lyft corporations. There's nothing, nothing new, nothing innovative about this exploitation. This is old fashioned, good, old fashioned garden variety exploitation of a so-called gig economy workers. And the only thing that we can do to overcome these powerful corporate executives, the venture capitalist and all the other gatherers who have a stake in maintaining these exploitative companies is for workers to get organized and always share that goal. So having said that, the reason I'm bringing this forward is because after having talked to dozens of drivers, I was quite convinced that this is even if we don't I mean, if I don't win this amendment today, which I don't think I will. I wanted to bring this forward as a topic of important discussion. And to accomplish this, it requires these two amendments. So we've discussed it. I've personally talked to dozens of drivers, but between my staff and I, we've probably talked to over 100 Lyft and Uber drivers about their working conditions, needs and concerns. We know that Uber and Lyft have generated, you know, really just incredible amounts of wealth for the top executives and other, you know, the major shareholders and so on. But the drivers, most of the drivers remain in deep and further deepening poverty and continue to do grow desperate. Drivers are struggling to survive economically, especially with the rising cost of housing. Many like healthcare. Some drivers are even living and sleeping inside their vehicles. Others are having trouble paying rent every month. And that is, you know, that's just worsening throughout the region. It's not just Seattle. Even drivers who are living in the southern extremity of King County are also facing that. Many of the drivers were former taxicab drivers who own taxi medallions and owning being. I'm using that term loosely because they run into massive amounts of debt to get a medallion in the first place. They borrowed huge sums of money in order to start their taxi business. And then Uber and Lyft disrupted the paid transportation sector, and the medallions lost nearly all of their value, destroying the hard earned assets of the taxi drivers and throwing many of the drivers into deep debt. Hence the need for suicide prevention and counseling in the Driver Solidarity and Resource Center. There is a strong need to prevent suicide, and the reason is because many of the drivers are stuck in debt. And in fact, I'm sorry to share with you and I already shared with you in earlier budget discussions that when we were when we were organizing for this in the last month and a half in that same period, one of the drivers who is of East African origin actually committed suicide in that time and lost his life. Deeply tragic event that falls directly at the doorstep of the Uber and Lyft corporations. And so I find this a very compelling issue, and I hope that in the coming year we are able to work towards it and make sure that it's not about what we call it. It's not about the name Solidarity and Resource Center, although it's a very apt name. It's about what what the drivers, the what the workers want out of such a resource center. And that is why I mentioned one of those things that they're asking for, which is suicide prevention and counseling, direct, you know, family assistance and support services, multilingual workshops, because many of the drivers are immigrants. English is the second, third or even fourth language for them. They need to be organized to advocate effectively for their rights in dealing with Uber and Lyft, an English language and English classes. Naturalization from immigrant into citizenship also is an important aspect of it because uber misclassified drivers as contractors rather than workers. Drivers are far more complicated taxes as well. And so there are all kinds of barriers and obstacles that the drivers face to have a decent standard of living. And, you know, we don't even imagine those things because as as non Uber drivers, we may not face the same needs. One of the most important issues that the best legislation is needed for is to address the long history that Uber and Lyft have had of arbitrarily firing drivers on. Or as they call it euphemistically, deactivating drivers. Deactivating drivers is nothing but firing without cause. That's what it is. And drivers will tell you they faced this almost on a day to day basis. It is absolutely outrageous. So the driver resolution center that is in the base legislation is intended to address that issue. However, I have a concern that all of that depends on Uber and Lyft agreeing to voluntarily participate in the driver resolution. Same token, I mentioned this before. And these companies do not have a good track record of treating drivers fairly. And I feel that that's a that's a stretch that it will happen. I will be thrilled if the companies are willing, but I also don't think we should assume that it will happen either. So if I drive a resolution center, start overturning the activations, we need to be real about how Uber and Lyft we anticipate will respond . There is one way to actually hold Uber and Lyft accountable, which is do, and that is to truly have the power to stop unfairly activations and to win a living wage. And that is, as I already said, is for drivers to get organized into a powerful union, because Uber and Lyft could not make a penny if the drivers went on strike and refused to drive. And they did that refusal in an organized way until their demands were met. And I'm not raising this as if to say that would be simple. We, many of us who have been in unionizing, driving the labor movement, we know that is one of the hardest things to do. It will take a lot of sacrifice. It will take a lot of community support. But it is worth raising because it is so crucial in building worker power. And also because this has been done in New York State and in New York City. The New York Taxi Drivers Alliance has won historic victories against Uber and Lyft corporations, winning practically the right for the drivers to be considered employees and not contractors. So we're not talking in the abstract. This has this we have examples to follow. We also saw the extremely successful Ab5 bill in California that was just won. So we have tremendous examples that we can build off of, maybe not in every single detail, but the overall model of worker organizing and power building is something that is is going to stand us in good stead. So just to go to a little bit of a specifics in the drivers, all Italian resource center drivers can come together to advocate collectively for their rights within the rideshare industry and get services including the legal support, training and community organizing to challenge driver deactivation. It will help them get organized because they will come and talk to each other over there and, you know, build your own power membership, meeting space for these organizing meetings, multilingual workshops, tax and financial training, voter registration and voter rights training, immigration and Naturalization Assistance, which I can tell you as an immigrant myself that you absolutely need that in order to make sure that you are not falling into some sort of bad situation. Driver Family Assistance and support services, counseling and mental health care, as I said, suicide prevention, English language meeting. So all of this is sort of encompassed in the idea of a solidarity and resource center. And that's why, as I said, even if this amendment doesn't pass today, I hope I look forward to the new council working together in making sure that these needs are fully incorporated in the uses for the revenues from the tax collection. And also one more thing I wanted to say. I mean, just as a testament to how wonderful leader drivers of organizing, how much courage it has required on their part because they are some of the most marginalized sisters and brothers. We have the Right Shirt Drivers Association. You know, in 2014 they really began their organizing under the Egis of the Teamsters, and they organized a strike against unfair deactivation and low wages. And I was there that day when they were courageously throwing their phones into a cardboard box that that was their strike, because the phone is where the app you reach the app to be a driver. And it took incredible courage. And I'll never forget that moment when all the drivers were throwing the phones into the boxes. And I want you to recognize Omar Mumin and Abdi Chau, who are part of the leadership of that alongside the Teamsters. And I wanted to hold up the sign. The sign has been hanging in my office since 2014, and it's a testament to how long the drivers have been organizing. And and I and I bring this up to point out that organizing works, fighting back works, because we wouldn't be here today with this bill in front of us if the drivers and the union hadn't taken those steps five years ago. And just to clarify, as I said, the budget amendment does not say anything specific about how much money should be allocated to this Solidarity and resource center. Instead, it merely includes the center at Indy approved list of uses for DNC tax revenues. And that will be in the resolution. So I will stop there. But in conclusion, really reiterate my hope that the Teamsters Union, the King County Labor Council, the rank and file drivers and progressives on the city council that we can really fight to make sure that the drivers have their fully full rights guaranteed in the next year or so. Thank you. Council members want we have amendment on the table that's been moved in second and I'll have some discussion. I don't want to. I'll go first off if others don't want to go first. First of all, I appreciate all of the comments and there's nothing in the resolution that by any stretch of the imagination is bad . It's all really good stuff. During the conversations on the base legislation, I talked about the name the first. We're on item 23, which really just changes the name Drivers Resolution Center for me. It should be more than that. And while Solidarity and Resource Center doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. The point being is I certainly would be receptive to a name that really talks about solidarity and empowerment and resources. And so I think that we're on to something there. Here's the challenge I have with the amendment and is why I will not support it at this time is number one. And what's likely to happen next year is the spending plan will have to come back to the council. It'll be more granular. We'll have data. The after labor standards will have gotten more information from the drivers and from customers and from the projections from the finance folks who know what kind of money we've generated. And there will be likely a supplemental budget or another ordinance in place. And it would seem to me that the primary thrust of the resolution center are that first resolving port deactivation. That's the first. That's the focus. And then what I had the language I had originally had come up with that got stricken by. We got some input from law and some other editors was retooling of drivers because at the end of the day we wanted them to have good jobs and if they didn't have good jobs to help them get good or even better jobs. And from that, we looked at it having an opportunity to both organize and have them have a stronger ability to do greater things for their lives and for their their families. But my concern at this point is whether we are losing focus on the sort of the competency of the center, number one. But number two, we've had to sort of look at this legislation during the budget process. That's been real tough. It's there's several components to it. And I just think, again, a next year that a council will sit down and talk to all of the drivers, get feedback and really make sure that we're investing the way consistent with what the all of the constituents are saying. It's a very sort of it's a tough constituent base because you certainly can't please anyone in this world of tenses. I've found that out. So I'm just wondering if it's a little premature at this point to be as granular in the approach. And that's pretty much my objection to it, not for what's what's in there. The other, I guess point I would make is that all of these components of the amendments, multilingual workshops, tax and financial training, voter registration, etc.. Again, all outstanding investments. And we are sort of creating these great services for a subset of the of our population drivers. And I'm where the question I would have is whether this great enriched work is better served in looking at what other groups and demographics outside of just the drivers circle we may want to support if we are to invest in that kind of center. So again, I do not oppose this approach. In fact, it's all really good stuff. I just wonder at this stage of the legislation whether we should be that granular. And as you may recall, the language we did approve during the budget process sort of talked about an organization with a proven commitment to workers rights and experience in providing resources to drivers and contractors and workers, particularly with cultural competencies, competencies with disadvantaged groups and disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. And so I think we were trying to head in that direction this year in hopes that we could be a little more granular next year. So those are reasons why I'm not supporting the amendment, but I want to thank Councilmember Swan for bringing it forward during the budget process. Any other comments or questions? We're just voting on 23, by the way, although we're talking about 25. I'll just stop there and see if anyone else raised her hand. We can't remember her. But I'm just to reorient myself. You just said we're just voting on 23. Not well or. Yeah, because we haven't even gotten to 2420. Councilman Swan basically described and I asked her to describe number. 23 and number 25, but we haven't read 25 into the record. But I've we're sort of talking about 25. 23 is a name change of 25, the substance of what she's presenting. That's why I said. If we are intending to speak to the amendment, when is the appropriate time to do that now? Yeah. Okay. Just to clarify, clarify, I'm non if this amendment for item number 23 doesn't pass and I'm not planning to bring forward the amendment for item number 25 because that it doesn't make sense. But if you don't mind, personnel, I would like a few closing remarks. Absolutely. Absolutely. Because her role did you it was ask your question is you. Have a question. Okay. So now will be the time to talk about 25, although it's not read into the record as it relates to the name change. I'm trying to squeeze that somehow. So yes. So I do see this amendment as broader than a name change and I certainly. Support. Its objectives as I understand the process going forward is that we as the Council will be briefed on the components of an RFP before it goes out. And I want to thank you, Council President, for reminding me of legislative language that is actually in the ordinance or the are. Well, right now it's a council bill. I hope hopefully will be an ordinance soon. But language in the council bill itself, that gives, I think, some good direction to the executive of what we would like to see coming back before an RFP goes out. And it specifically says that we would like a driver resolution center to consider contractual partnerships among entities to achieve the direct participation of organizations primarily focused on diversity and advocating for the civil and economic rights of workers from disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. So for me, that language. Uplifts the council's intent for a driver resolution center. And I think it sends a strong message that we want a entity that is bidding on the funding for the center to do more than simply resolve employer employee conflict complaints. And so I'm comfortable with this direction and am supporting this language and not the amended language to the or the amendment to the resolution. Thanks, Herbert Council Member O'Brien. Did you have some comments you like to make? I did. Thank you all. And I reiterate some of the comments that I've heard from others, but I fully support. And Councilmember Swan, I think you're absolutely right on the direction that this work needs to go. I'm not going to support this amendment because frankly, as Council President Harrell said, the timing of this, not the amendment, frankly , but the timing of this work coming to the council and the work required and the outreach required to do this properly. I think I haven't had that time during the budget to do that, but I do believe there will be opportunities in the New Year to do that work. I think that what's critically important going forward as we transition from this phase where legislation was drafted and introduced and started to be publicized during a very busy budget season and turn into a process that it will hopefully be a much more transparent and inclusive process where where people can engage thoughtfully in how they want to see this work move forward, that it's going to be incumbent upon the council next year to be making sure that that process is open to everyone and transparent. I've been aware for a number of months that this work was happening here at City Hall, but frankly, as a council member, I was not part of those discussions and was largely in the dark, and that's as a council member. I can only imagine how it felt to be a driver knowing that conversations were happening about your future and you're not participating in those conversations, let alone being even aware of where that happens. And when those when actions like that happen, it breeds a lot of mistrust. And I will say that the people that were party to that I understand why the conversations happened the way they did. I don't believe anyone is intending to undermine anyone else's interests. But there's an opportunity that I think the city needs to lead on in the new year, which is opportunity to bring the drivers together in a very transparent and inclusive way to understand their concerns. There's a lot of different drivers out there with a lot of different backgrounds and a lot of different interests. And those interests aren't always exactly aligned. But in my number of years of working with the drivers, what I know is that they're a dedicated, passionate group who can build consensus and work together to find a way to make this move forward to benefit all drivers. And if we fail at that and the drivers do not have the trust of each other, unfortunately, the folks who will continue to make money and exploit them will be the big corporations that are doing so today. And so it's in all of our interests to figure out, to do that hard work, to get folks coming together . And Councilmember Swan, I think the language in here goes a long way to indicating that. I just have some concerns about the specific wording and how it's used and would prefer, since this is really just largely a resolution to say what the council is going to do next year to see what I hope the council does next year, but not vote yes on this resolution or the other name change. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Brian, before council members want closer debate on her proposal there, any other questions or comments from anyone our customers want? You want to close this out? Yes. Firstly, on your point, President Harrell and. Fully I mean, I. Didn't exactly understand, but I think your point about what can we have a broader impact, a broader community impact than just drivers? First of all, I just want to point out that the drivers come from marginalized communities themselves. So whatever we do to directly help the drivers also helps their families and their children and their spouses. And they are all part of a deeply marginalized community. So I honestly would not worry about that in any way. Also, I would say that in the New Year, when we think about revenues for this tax, we have to and I hope the new council will have the courage to do this, because the voters have certainly given us their mandate that we will have the courage to not do the business as usual of pitting Peter to, you know, robbing Peter to pay Paul and pitting various needs against one another, because which is a direct result of a lack of political courage to really aggressively go for progressive revenues of different kinds. So rather than posing the question of can we have a broader use of revenues from the TNC tax, I would much rather pose it as can we make sure that their drivers and their families get the maximum benefit out of the TNC tax? And can we also browse the Amazon tax? Can we also pass impact fees on corporate developers? And can we also post vacancy fees? And can we also make sure that every that no stone is left unturned in raising progressive revenue so that we don't say, well, are there other communities that need to be supported? Because, frankly, the vast majority of social needs in our city and region are not being supported at this moment. The other thing I wanted to say, just to echo other Councilmember Arun made a very important point, which is that I think all organizers on the ground have an obligation to make sure that we prioritize unity and power building among the drivers, and that that obligation lies with me as a councilmember. I take that responsibility seriously. And as a union member, I will say that responsibility lies on union organizers also. We all have to take that responsibility seriously. And I think we all understand the way the balance of forces work that if drivers are not brought together and don't work in a strong united fashion, then those entities that end up benefiting is not the union, but it's Uber and Lyft Corporation. And so I really appreciate this allows me to lift up an important point that came up during the organizing that both the drivers who are primarily organizing with the app based drivers association and the drivers who are primarily organizing under the banner of the Rideshare Association have actually themselves put an emphasis on their own unity regardless of what anybody else is doing, and that I wanted to appreciate. And so in addition to thanking brothers, Omar and Abdullah also wanted to thank Brothers Don Cleary, Peter, Cool and Latoya, Ammad and also Sister Julie Davis, who've all really well, I mean, we may not all be on the same page on every last thing, but we are clearly on the same page that workers, drivers need to be united. And that gives me a lot of hope and I look forward to the next year. And just last but not least, as far as the specific wording, I honestly don't think that the wording we've brought forward is specific. It's very general and these are all needs that we clearly know the community has. I don't think there's anything controversial in that. I hope that in the new year we will see driver needs being prioritized. But my message is also for my sisters and brothers who are drivers, that we are not going to win any of that unless we keep getting organized and we keep building unity and building power among ourselves to. Okay. So we have an amendment on item number 23. It's been moved in a second and I'm going to take a vote just on the amendment, not on the base bill. Okay. So we're just voting on the amendment.

Councilwoman Mongo. Ocean cares. Thank you. Item 17, please. I'm Phil Bridge. Item 17 This communication from Councilwoman Price Recommendation two closed a pedestrian bridge at Emefiele Avenue in order to address persistent crime and public safety issues. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you. I do want to hear from the public on this. I know there are members of the public here, but before I do that, I want to state that the motion is actually different than the agenda item. Rather than requesting a closure of the bridge. We're going to be requesting pin code for the gate so that people, anyone requesting the code can get the code and be able to access both neighborhoods through the gate. And that's the proposal on the floor tonight. And I want to hear from the public about it, and we can talk a little bit about it. But I know there are competing standpoints and concerns with with the bridge access. And so we want to make sure that we address those concerns while providing access to anyone who should want to have it. So with that, if it's okay with you, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to go to the public comment, but I wanted to make sure everyone knew that it wasn't a bridge closure that we were talking about at this juncture. Thank you. And there's no need to stand, folks. I do have the public the the list. And so I will call you in the call the first few folks up. Okay. So the speaker's list and because we have more than ten, it will be it will be 90 seconds. So in this order, Mr. Goodhew, Zari Morrell, Dan Lowenthal, Amelia Ghareeb and Ron King are the first five speakers to please come forward in that order. And if I mispronounce your name, I apologize. So please, please line up. It's Mr. Goodhue, Zoe Morrell, Dan Lowenthal, Amelia Ghareeb and Ron King. Please come forward. Thank you. It's good to hear. It makes eminent sense. Move forward with it. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Hey, how are you doing? How are you, man? How you doing, customer? Christ. My name is Dr. Zoe Morrell and I actually live in Park Estates and I love living there and had always felt safe. However, the two most important things to me are my daughter's one day. Luckily, I have a practice in a usually in Los Angeles, I have a practice now in Los Alamitos. I got a call that somebody, a skinhead who looked like he was high on drugs, was throwing rocks at my house, called the police. And obviously this is a low priority item. Ten, 15 minutes went by. I got another call. No one was there. I actually went home. Went home. And that person was across the street, had tried to break into my house. I am not a person who has weapons. I'm a surgeon and I had a sledgehammer. So I went to try to disarm this guy with a sledgehammer. I called my across the street neighbor, who's also a physician. He happened to come home, called the cops again, who I respect and really appreciate. Still, no one was there. We had to physically disarm this person as he was breaking in to my across the street neighbor's house. Now, unbeknownst to me, his daughter was home. I only thought if my daughters were home, his daughter was home and she runs out after she keeps calling the police. Until we told them that he had a weapon. She wanted them to know that the two black guys actually were the ones who were the heroes and that we were the ones with the weapon trying to disarm this gentleman so that we would not get injured. This is really an issue because my daughters, I love to have them walk around the block. My my youngest started a dog walking business. I can't have her do that anymore. My other one babysits kids throughout the neighborhood. I can't have her do that anymore because they don't feel safe and it is unsafe. And I really think that disclosure will help solve that problem. Thank you very much, sir. SLAUGHTER Which is a long thought. Thank you. Good evening. It's an honor to be here. Thank you, Councilwoman Price, for all of your hard work. I strongly support this item. The I think context is important. When Park Estates was built in 1948, there was no bridge. There was no access from Atherton about ten or 11 years after that. There previously had been a creek behind Park Estates that ran parallel. To Atherton on the south side of Atherton. The county came in and built a storm drain. At that time, they granted a six foot easement from Atherton to reach the. Storm drain, and they. Did a cement bridge over. The storm drain. Both of those things were for access for the maintenance workers, not for public access into park. Estates, but it became. Commonly used for that purpose. That is not necessarily problematic, except two things have developed since that time. One is that there's a little alcove. Next to the bridge. It's entirely unlit, it's hidden, it's out of you can't be viewed. By law enforcement, and it's become a magnet of criminal activity. There are commonly syringes can be found there. Remnants of packages that are stolen from the neighborhood can be found there. People sleep there. The second thing is the bridge provides ingress and egress into the neighborhood for burglaries to be committed. My home was burglarized. I put up a sophisticated. Video surveillance system. It was probably torn down. The home was burglarized again. My neighbor's home was burglarized. And the commonality of all of these burglaries is each instance the person comes from across the bridge. Enters through a window, burglarized is the. Home, and then escapes back across the bridge undetected because it's just. So out of you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr.. Thank you. Thank you so much. Our next speaker, I mean. Good evening. My name is Amelia Greve. I am a resident of Sovereign Park Estates, which is a 156 unit owner, occupied cooperative apartments directly next to that bridge that we've heard so much about. I depend on that bridge to safely walk. My dog is a woman alone. My elder elderly neighbors depend on that bridge to go to church, to go to social areas, to. Go over the crooked duck, to get their exercise. I am that's my all that is our residents only access to safe, walkable areas. We don't have crosswalks across Atherton. All we have is traffic and E-Scooters. I do not have $1,000,000 home. I am a public school teacher, but I have that bridge and I have a safe. Place to. Walk and so do my residents. I strongly urge you to please keep it open for our neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you, Ron King. Hi. I too live in the Park Estates area, and this Alfred L filled bridge. It's about nine homes up from me or down from me, actually. And I noticed that when I first moved in the area, I saw this, you know, on a just a walk around the neighborhood. I saw this bridge. I thought, this is kind of odd. I walked over and it just goes over to the next street, goes over the wash area, the flood control area. And that was about it. But things also I noticed that after 20 some odd years of living, there is the crime. Escalated. And we live in an area right there in that area that there's no through roads or whatnot. You either live there, you don't, or you're just totally lost. And I wasn't surprised about the crime escalating. So the crime found me. My car was parked in in the driveway, probably. 30 yards from the street. And my fault. I didn't lock the door, but I got up the next day and it had been vandalized and everything thrown out of the car. Had some samples from my employment thrown all over my all over my driveway in the front yard. I thought that was quite odd. So time passed and whatnot. And this, this last year we were burglarized, which I thought, this is this is just crazy. But I will say this in closing, and that is the only traffic people I see. Disturbing people, per se. I mean, I said the good, the bad. Thank you so much. Time. Time's up. Six where I go. I want to keep the time timely. If my time's up. Yes, I didn't look. Thank you, sir. Let me go ahead. The next five speakers are Melissa Paulson, Garrett DiGiorgio, Ted Bruder, Tyler Paulsen and Ruth one. Please come forward in that order. Melissa Paulsen. Gary Director. Georgio Ted Aberdare. Tyler Paulson and Ruth one. Hello. I'm a resident of Park Estates. I just want to say that I strongly support this measure for the safety of my home and my family. Thank you very much, Speaker, please. Hi. My name's Gary DiGiorgio. I live 12 doors down from this opening. I just want to say that, uh. Progressively things have gotten worse in the neighborhood. My home has been burglarized. They've caught individuals directly in front of my home breaking into cars. And it's just it's a slippery slope and it's getting worse. Having worked in law enforcement for 25 years. I will tell you that. In terms of first responders, fire is not coming through there to save anybody. From a police perspective. It would enable them to hold a perimeter for. People who are in that community. For those that say, hey, I use it to walk through regularly, I would say that we have three other entry points. It would be a five minute more of a walk, which. I think is the councilwoman said earlier. Walking is healthy. It's good for everyone. So I would I would just ask that. You know, we definitely look at having a keycard or a complete closure. Thank you. Unit speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Ted Brunner. I am the track rep for that tract that has the entrance on Allen Field. I am also the president of the Park Estates Homeowners Association. I started this discussion with Suzy and Jack and Craig from Department of Public Works. About a year and a half ago, talking about all of the crime issues that we have and what can we do to control access. And at the time, we when we met out with Craig at the site and talked about putting up a PED gate, pedestrian gate with key code access or some kind of turnstile, something to control, ingress. Egress, so that we could keep the I can't bend it, but that's really what there are the homeless people and the addicts that come into park states. They have one path that comes through right by my house. I live right next door to that guy and they and I have my church member walking into three times. He stole my bike, jumped over my fence in broad daylight with people home next door to steal my bike. So these people have no shame. They don't have any threat. They don't they don't look at anything and say this is a bad deal. So we need to regulate access. And I'm not talking about cutting it off and sealing it. My proposal after item of proposal, it would be a hard closure for three months to change habits and then put the PED kid up to replace the hard closure so that everyone that belongs there can get in and then have the police department be in charge of handing out key cards. Criminals are not going to go to the PD to get a keycard and then you can just have them come in and out. Thank you so much. Our next speaker, please. Good evening, tyler polson. I am strongly in favor of this item. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ruth one. I also echo that notion. I'm a Pakistani resident and a mom of two young boys, and they do a lot of. Outdoor. Activities at night. They're big tennis players, and I don't actually feel safe with the amount of suspicious people that I myself have personally witnessed that very much are very disheveled. They look intoxicated. I have called the police myself. I've taken pictures of them on my neighbor's property looking into their windows. And it's just a very uncomfortable. Feeling that you. Cannot be outside at night. So thank. You. Thank you very much. And last speakers are Will Willie Gaffney, Rebecca Corrie, Margaret Lehnert says Margaret Cohn, who killed Ingrid Nicolay and David Eastman. Please come forward in that order. Willie Gaffney. Rebecca Corrie. Margaret Keough, Ingrid Nicolay and David Eastman. Good evening. Thanks for hearing from me. I'm Dr. Willie Gaffney. I also am. A resident of Park. Estates. What you guys may not know is that there's now a homeless encampment of sorts down on Atherton, which is just outside of our community. It appears that these some of the homeless people are accessing our neighborhood due to this walk away, and we very much would like to have it. Limited access. I am a neighbor of Dr. Morrell. My home is the one that was actually burglarized that day. A gentleman didn't get in, but I worry because my daughter was at home. She's 21 and she typically will leave our home to walk the dog and won't set the alarm. Can you imagine what would have happened if he had actually gained access and had been inside of our home when she got back from walking the dog? Can you imagine what would have happened if I had been home when he broke the window and put his hand in? I would have responded with lethal force. That's pretty dangerous. Imagine what would have happened if my daughter hadn't alerted the policeman that the two black guys were armed and were two good guys holding a white gentleman who was unarmed on the street. If they come around the corner and open fire, that that would have been a horrible outcome or could have been a horrible outcome. Now, I strongly encourage you to limit. Access to these bridges. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. If anyone else can, please just come forward and rest the speakers. Please come forward closer. Thank you. I'm Ingrid Nicolai. I've lived in the neighborhood over 30 years. Things have changed. And one thing that bothers me is that there are transients sleeping right down in there where the preschoolers. And whenever I walk through there, I'm thinking, these are kids that are two and three. I don't think they're four yet. But these people are walking through and talking to those kids. I don't think that's safe. I I've noticed that they're dropping all sorts of paraphernalia. They don't really. I've asked them to, you know, what are you doing? They said, it's none of your business. I can be here if you can be here. They're caring. I was upset when I saw driving down the block. Two or three of them who had stolen the tricycles from the preschool and their the bigger utility trikes. I should have stopped them, but I didn't. And I still feel bad about that. But the neighborhood is not safe having that open. They're all going through with bags. They're all riding their bikes. They're all going down the hill, turn in the corner to get out on Atherton. And I'm all in favor of putting a lock code on that gate. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next picture, please. Hi, I'm Rebecca Corey. I'm in favor of the game with Ingrid. I've lived in the neighborhood 30 years. And we've had. Nothing but break ins, robberies, packages, mail checks, stolen tags off our car, you name it. It's happened time and time again and I'm in favor of it. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, please. Hi, I'm Margaret Kuo and I also strongly support this item. I live. In on a street that is adjacent to the bridge and. Have had packages stolen and have my. Had my car broken into. And I would also. Emphasize that it's called the bridge, but it's not really. A bridge. It's a very irregular. Pathway that is dark and. Kind of covered. Over with trees and hedges. And it is a source of concern and anxiety and worry when it comes to my safety. And the safety of my son. So thank you for taking the time to. Listen to the residents. Requests and to the rest of the Council. I would hope that you would support this. Agenda item as well. Thank you. Thank you so much. And David Eastman. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. I'm also Resident Park Estates. I have been there for 25 years. For 25 years, I have talked about all the criminals who are coming in through the gate off of Bellflower and over the bridge from from Atherton. But nobody talks about all the criminals who are coming into the neighborhood on Los Lomas Street, which happens to be where I live. Basically, what we've heard is we've got crime in the neighborhood. Yes, we do less and less than most places in Long Beach. The the basic idea that those criminals are coming across the bridge is based on no facts whatsoever. We have anecdotal material. I have suggested in the comment section that we do a very extensive statistical study before we either get it or even pass out cards for it. And I would like to see the criteria for the cards before we do that, because it may limit people outside who do come into our neighborhood and actually provide us additional eyes on illegal things because they're nice people who like to walk in our neighborhood. I know if this seems like there's an awful lot of money to spend. The Park Estates Homeowner's Association does have some money for neighborhood security. I know I was on the board, I was the treasurer for a number of years and there's quite a bit of money there that if the city thinks it's too much money to ask, then I think the homeowners association can kick in. Thank you very much. Very much. That concludes public comment. A Councilwoman Price. Sort of what we're looking at. So, Eric, I'm not sure if you're back there, but if you could cue up the photos. Okay. So just to give everyone kind of a overview of where we're at, this is the Park Estates area. And you can see the main cross streets that are relevant to this discussion is Atherton. And the red line there, that's where the bridge is located. So I'm just going to go through a few photos here. There's the flood control channel and you can see the yellow delineates where the bridge is currently located or the walkway. This is the entry point to the walkway from Atherton. These are a few photos of the walkway that you can see so that you can see what walkway we're talking about here. I believe that Judge Lowenthal is correct, that this was not designed to be in the beginning a walkway. It was designed to be an access point for maintenance. However, it has turned into a walkway. And you can kind of see what the ground of it looks like and what the condition is. This is the cul de sac area that the walkway leads to in the Park Estates neighborhood. So generally, anyone who's on the street and a vehicle would be someone who's living in that street because it is a cul de sac area. This is the viewpoint of the bridge leading into the bridge from the Park Estates area. And again, another shot of that, and this is the flood control channel. So I'm glad to be discussing this topic tonight with the full city council. For background, this has been a location that countless residents have contacted my office about for the past four or five years. It comes up at community meetings. I actually had one of the residents who spoke tonight came to a concert in the park, and while everyone else was seated outside with their picnic blankets, enjoying the music, he came specifically to talk to me about this bridge. And after doing so, promptly left to go home because he wanted to make sure he had face to face contact with me. It's been the focus of discussions at so many community meetings and it's an interesting issue because it's very localized to two different neighborhoods, both in the third Council District and actually it affects the fourth Council District as well because a lot of residents there use it and want to continue to be able to use it. So with the competing concerns that we have in mind, I've been working all day today to try to figure out a compromise that we can put into play on a pilot basis so that we can have the opportunity to collect some data, do a little bit more, study an analysis, and really track what's been going on. So a couple of things to the folks who I represent who live in the apartment complex. I get it. Walking is my absolute favorite hobby and my refuge. If I didn't walk, I wouldn't be sane. And so I understand the need to have the ability to walk and have access to beautiful neighborhoods such as park estates, and be able to have the peace and not be on a major corridor. Limiting access to residents who want to walk in the area is not an issue, and that's not the concern. The concern is the invitation for, as I've shown here, with no lighting, an area where people can seek refuge and have easy access points to residential communities, which I don't think is something that anybody wanted or hoped to to have. So I'm proposing adding temporarily adding a gate with a pin code that could be used to open the gate. The pin code would be freely given to anyone who emails or calls. In fact, between now and when the gate is installed, we will have a sign out there. And I'm hoping that the residents from both park estates and the apartment complex will help me share with people that there's going to be an access code, because we want to make sure that people who want to use this for walking have the access code. So after that, we'll have a sign at the gate that has the number or email address to contact in order to get the access code. So we'll set that up so that anyone who wants to can have access to it. Will it be perfect? Probably not. It's the first time that we've done something like this. So this is an opportunity for us to experiment and see what works and what doesn't. And that's what the six month period will be about. It's an it's an attempt to try to compromise. What I am asking from the Park Estates residents is if you see something, say something. You have to contact the police. You have to contact the police when you see something. Because if what you're seeing is not supported in police data in terms of calls for service, then it's not something that the city can rely on to take further action. So we'll be we'll be studying what happens in the next 30 to 45 days before the gate is installed. We'll also be studying. What happens after that. So I'm asking my colleagues to support me in this item. This is a local neighborhood issue and I ask for your support. Thank you so much, Councilman Austin. Okay. Members, please cast your votes. Comes Mamasapano. As a member, Richardson. Bush and. Kerry. Okay. Thank you very much. Motion carries will move on to the next item. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Mr. Modica. Thank you, Vice Mayor. The staff report on this will be given by Sandy Palmer, our Purchasing and Business Services Bureau Manager. Good evening. Honorable, honorable vice mayor and members of the City Council. Tonight you have before you the biennial report on public convenience and necessity for taxicab service, as well as the report on the Taxi Regulation Modernization Pilot Program. Staff has completed its investigation into the public convenience necessity and is recommending that Council find the number of authorized taxi cabs is sufficient for the needs of the city. The Council find Long Beach Yellow Cab Cooperative is in full compliance with the terms and conditions of their permit. That the period for filing of taxicab applications remained closed and that the council approve a requested change in logo, vehicle branding and vehicle color, which was provided in the hearing packet. Staff has also completed its evaluation of the Taxi Regulation Modernization Pilot Program. The pilot program allowed vehicles in the Yellow Cab fleet to be subject to alternate regulations, which included the use of variable demand based rates, a smartphone based electronic application and expedited driver onboarding. Staff finds that the pilot program has been an effective tool to assist Yellow Cab in remaining competitive in the TNC driven market while providing quality taxicab services to Long Beach residents and transit.

Next item, please. Looks like it is 23. Communication from Health and Human Services. Recommendation to authorize city manager to receive and expend grant funding and an estimated amount of 25,200 to provide HIV program services citywide. Thank you. There's a motion and a second. Councilwoman Pryce. Is there a staff report? Why don't we get a staff report? Yes, there is. There's a staff report. We have Kelly Collopy and Dr. Davis, our health officer. Well. Am I on? Okay. Well, Silver. Good evening, honorable mayor and council members. Thank you for providing this opportunity to share about the HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Program, otherwise known as Prep. I wanted to take this time to highlight the importance of HIV Prep and the important work that's occurring in Long Beach to prevent HIV infection. In 2017, do you have the clicker? Okay. In 2017. There were 4520 people living with HIV in Long Beach. Most of these individuals resided in the 1908 or 292813 and 90804 zip codes. In 2017, there were 107 new HIV infections reported among Long Beach residents. The rate of HIV infection in Long Beach is higher than that of Los Angeles County in the state of California. We did see a 33% decrease between 2012 and 2016, but it's still at an unacceptable level. Next, HIV pre-exposure. Can I ask a question? I'm sorry, just one shot. I'm clear on that. Can you get back one side when you say that? I know that that HIV infection rate is larger in Long Beach per se, when you compare it comparatively to the county. When you say if there's a 33% decrease from 12 to 16. Mm hmm. So even though it's still it's still decreasing, though, right? So it's still larger, but it's continuing to decrease, is that correct? Right. Okay. So it's still larger, but it's decreasing the rate of HIV. Infection, the state of new infections. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. It's kind of stagnated or was like HIV, pre-exposure prophylaxis or prep is a way for people who do not have HIV, but who are at substantial risk of getting it to prevent HIV infection by taking one pill every day. The pill is called Truvada and was approved by the Federal Drug Administration to be used for HIV prep in 2012. When someone is exposed to HIV through sex or injection drug use, this pill can work to keep the virus from establishing a permanent infection. When taking consistently every day, Prep has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection by greater than 92%. Prep is a powerful HIV prevention tool and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to provide even greater protection than when used alone. Next. Based on the Los Angeles County HIV AIDS strategy for 2020 and beyond, to reach our goal of reducing the number of new HIV infections in the county, it's estimated that 4543 Long Beach residents would need to be on prep consistently by the year 2020. As of 2017, approximately 430 people are on prep in Long Beach. This mirrors the national trend of less than 10% of the estimated 1.2 million people who could benefit from Prep actually getting it. We realize we have a ways to go to reach our 2020 goal, but are confident that working with our community and providers that we can reach it. Long Beach residents can receive prep at the Long Beach Health Department as well as several other locations. Next, patients who are taking prep are seen regularly by a medical provider and sexually transmitted disease testing and treatment is done at that time. Prep is usually covered by insurance, and Gilead, the maker of the drug, has a patient assistance program that can help defray the cost of the medication. Los Angeles County provided up to $300,000 to the health department to implement our HIV prep program. Other organizations serving Long Beach were funded as well. That funding is sunsetting in 2018, and the state of California has started providing financial assistance to local providers to cover the HIV prep costs for both insured and uninsured individuals. Next. The Long Beach HIV planning group has been meeting for many years. It's made up of partners and community members who are all committed to ending HIV in Long Beach, including health care providers, public health, substance abuse treatment and education professionals and community activists, among others. One of our primary goals is to increase the number of people on Prep in Long Beach. The HIV Planning Group Prep Committee is addressing the issues of making more high risk individuals and health care providers aware of the existence and benefit of HIV prep and eliminating barriers to starting and staying on prep, all of which have been shown to play a part in the current suboptimal use of the medication. Next IV share Pre-Exposure prophylaxis is a powerful tool to stop HIV infections. Another tool to prevent transmission of HIV is known as you equals you, which means undetectable equals and transmissible. If an HIV positive person's viral load is suppressed or undetectable, there is virtually no risk to transmit the virus to others. So by treating an HIV positive person to an undetectable level, not only are you enabling that person to live a full, healthy life, but you have the added benefit of preventing the spread of the virus to others. In early 2018, the Long Beach Health Department signed on to an international consensus statement supporting you equals to you. We, in conjunction with our partners, are committed to utilizing these tools to their fullest capacity to halt the spread of HIV. Thank you for your time tonight. That concludes my presentation and I'm. Available for questions. Thank you. Really, really great work. Councilwoman Price. Ditto. Excellent work. And it's just so impressive to me how much work you guys do with grant funding and what a great job you do with outreach. And I really appreciate your efforts to communicate on this issue and some of the citywide efforts that you've participated in in terms of outreach and education. Thank you very much. Thank you. Do I face more injuries? Yes. And again, I want to thank you so much for the work that you guys do put into this program. Thank you again. Oh, you're welcome. I just wanted to say that it is really a citywide effort that a lot of organizations in the. City have received the grant. Funding. And we're really working together. Thank you. And I just want to just interject real quick, similar and maybe I didn't get it in the presentation. Are we providing prep at the health department? Yes. So we are. When there was a slide, they had like I think seven or eight. Saw. The organizations. Those are all providing prep. And so so you can so we're providing prep through the health department. And what is that something that you that folks is there from from a cost perspective? How are we dealing with that? So you can we can bill your insurance. And then there was also a demonstration project funded by Los Angeles County. They got CDC funding and so they funded the testing, the meds and the navigator to help you kind of navigate the system. And that's sunsetting in September. And so now the state of California has allocated funds to help cover the cost of the medical provider and to help get you hooked up with the meds and the lab testing and the treatment for STDs, that part of. Things. So if you if you don't have insurance or if you are underinsured or are we just creating some kind of. State would be the best. The State would, but we would function as the actual organization that gives out the prep at the Health Department right now. Yeah, we are the providers. So a couple of years ago we brought forward to the council the initial jump into the into the service model. And we've been working with L.A. County to negotiate that. And now at this time for this item, it is the funding from the state to allow us to provide for those who are unfunded. This is really, really important work. So thank you for for all this. I know we've been talking about this and I hadn't realized that we had made so much progress already. So that's great. Thank you. Councilman Richardson. Thanks, Mr. Mayor. And thanks, Dr. Davis and Kelly for the presentation. And we've had conversations about this, and I just want to point out something and have a quick conversation. So I see the three zip codes where most cases are found or. 90802908090813 and 90804. But then when you look at the new cases, nine available for drops off the list, which is good news for 9004 but not a waiting five comes in. What is the narrative behind that difference? Is it traditionally been, you know, on the rise? And I 25 and on the on the way down and I know two four or I know that some of these ZIP codes I personally know that 980592103 and I know it or two or three zip codes that have have seen significant population growth. You know, 925 has grown four times higher than the city's pace and population growth. So is it is there folks moving or that we have a real problem in like 9 to 5 we need to address? Well. Like nationally, we're seeing one of the highest rates of getting HIV is in the African-American community. And so with 90805 having a large African-American community, I'm hypothesizing that that might be some of why 90805 is making on to the new HIV infection list. Like as a one of the zip codes. These are rates. So it's per population versus versus direct numbers. Sure. Yeah. I'd like to I'd like to dig into that more because to do that. So I just see the correlations at 9805 is now one of the youngest zip codes in the city is one of the growing zip codes in the city. And with that comes challenges that really haven't historically been a priority in that area that need to be, you know, started sort of become more of a priority and read it. The other thing I would say is the statistics here are great, but the narrative that I you know, I've been working with St Mary's and some of the, you know, other folks around this conversation. The narrative is that and tell me if I'm wrong, but the narrative is that Long Beach is number six and new HIV cases in the country is that are we way off? Because that's what's out there in the community? I don't think you're way off. I don't have the exact number, but it's somewhere like that. Number six across the country. I think we need to thank you for this work, but I think it needs, particularly if we know that communities of color and males of color are statistically higher here. And given just, frankly, the makeup of the city council, there's a number of males of color here. I think we need to talk about this more. I think we need to engage on this issue more. But thank you for this presentation and I think we need to continue this work. Thank you. I just did want to add that the way that the funding structures work is they're very significantly underfunded for outreach, testing and other things both around HIV and AIDS. TB, which I have shared. And in North London there are fewer providers than in other areas, and we are looking to address and how we could locate and bring services to that community. Well, if I could, I would. Add I think we need to bring that to the conversation that's happening around 925 with a plan, planning for future needs. I think health needs to really engage in that conversation. Thank you. Cancer appears. Yes. I also want to say what great work you guys have done. I know that in last year's budget this was a hot topic for us. And so I really want to appreciate all the efforts that have been done. Could you remind us I know you mentioned that African-Americans are one of the rising populations. Can you remind us of the other populations that are increasingly affected? In general? It's younger folks, men who have sex with men, people who use HIV drugs. And then we see a lot of homelessness and. Drug use and mental health issues that are. Contributing to this as. Well. So how is the health department working with our continuum of care around homelessness and Multi-Service Center? So we're reaching out a lot to test in that area and working with the MSE and homeless providers when we do have patients that we're trying to find to get them in because it is a tough poppy. Relation to, you know, get addresses. On and get in and get treated. And tested and what have you. Great. Go ahead and say part of the services that are partner services so someone is identified. And what we do is we work to find out who their partners are to help to help bring them in as well. So among the homeless population, that's a little more difficult, but we're working with the MSI to work through that. Great. I think that is a I'm sure it is a challenging job to try to track down partners and go through that process. And so I really am. Happy and. Happy that you guys have taken this on as not just getting the grants for, but I know it's something that we've got the work group. I know my staff attends. One other question that I wanted to ask is on the outreach. I know I recall last year in the budget we talked about a population that was, you know, maybe a diverse population that was using apps more and that that population was seeing a rise just in STDs in general, maybe not HIV, but kids in general and wondering what our outreach to that population of that community has been on education around STDs. Well, I know that. As far as reaching out on apps is being done primarily at the state level because they didn't want, like every jurisdiction to be reaching out to all the apps. But I think I think where you're taking that is that the time we're talking about how the access to apps and hooking up is increased as part of the increase we are seeing in a number of studies and so we are working on it. And where we're rising is that need at the state and federal level? Are there's much funding at all? I mean, I want to say our budget is under $100,000 for STDs. And so the funding is actually in HIV work. And we're trying to, while we're there, also be testing and working around STD prevention. So that is an area that we're really trying to work more closely and to generate, but it is severely under-resourced at all levels and it's an issue across the country. Wow. That's that's not a lot of funding. Well, just again, thank you so very much for all of your work in your effort on this. I look forward to hearing more about your efforts in the upcoming budget conversation. Thanks so much. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Richardson. I know very little people are paying attention, but I have another question I forgot I got to ask. Well, I have the two of you here. So we talk about Prep now. I know Prep is in pill form. I know this conversation about getting to something you don't have to take daily like shots and stuff like that. You have no and then and then prep as well. So we're, you know, do you know about that? Are we going to be able to deploy that? So we do offer prep. So we offer. Yeah. So after you've been exposed, there's this a big time limit, so you have to get to people quickly. The shots, I'm not sure where we're at with that, but this not something follow. Up and think about. Thanks. Appreciate it. Thank you. Any public comment on this item? Seeing none. Oh, please. Looking straight ahead as this gentleman's hair is coming down. I just want to make sure that. We elevate this conversation a little bit. There's a lot of information that came to us that I think is really important for us to elevate. And I think we need to have a broader conversation around more of the data and and what is happening and why we are being impacted the way we are and what we need to do better. I know, obviously, you know, what we can do is limited, but I think we can do more than what we're doing, clearly . And so I'm just not sure what, you know, how we do that. I think we're going to will brainstorm some. I think we need to elevate this a little bit more to the broader community, because I know it's happening at the Health Department and I think you guys are having great conversation with it with our partners in the hospitals and and certainly a bunch of foundations as well as the center and others. But I think for this body, we need to elevate it and put a little bit more emphasis on it. So I just thank you for the presentation. Yes. Hi. My name is Michael Neutron. I am a second district resident. I'm also a prep navigator at St Mary Medical Center. I see about half the people in Long Beach on Prep in my office. I've seen a big change happen in HIV prevention over the past few years. We've gone into a biomedical model. This is something that's happened under the Obama administration, and I think we have the opportunity to move things forward and really bring down the HIV rate. We know, as we've heard, that people who are on medication and are undetectable aren't going to transmit the virus. And so we can reduce the rate of new HIV cases by testing as many people as possible. Getting those people who test positive on medications and stop the spread of the epidemic that way. I know at the program where I work, the clients who come in who do test positive, we have 90% of that, over 90% of them at undetectable. And these are very difficult to reach clients. A lot of our clients are homeless, active drug users. They're there, have access to our housing services, our food pantry, our dental clinic, mental health services. So one of the ways that testing can help the community at large is getting these people into social services. We have access to HIV, housing, money. So if we can get these people tested, we can get them into our programs and and start addressing these other issues that we have in the city. The same thing happens on my end for the high risk negatives that I'm working with. We're getting them in. We're testing them for STDs every three months. The people who have HIV are getting tested for SCD every three months. We've seen the rate of STDs go at 500% in the past five years. And by testing more people, getting them into treatment if they need it, getting them on prep, if they need that , we're doing a lot more testing for STDs and we can help to bring down the STD rate that way. So I think we have a lot of great things in place now. The trick is we need to expand them exponentially. On the federal level, they're looking to get about the same number of people with HIV. They want to see those, that same number on prep. L.A. County has similar numbers where they want to see Long Beach have about 4400 people. I think people on Prep, which is about equivalent to the number of people we have living with HIV. That would mean that I would need to enroll another thousand people. So we need I think it would be great if the city council could look at this further. I think we can become like places like San Francisco, Washington State, New York State, where they've made a priority of addressing HIV. Put a little of the general fund money in to address these kind of issues and and have some successes here. Thank you. Thank you. Mike. Thank you. Thank you very much. Councilmember Pearce. Yes. I just wanted to thank you for for staying late and for all of your efforts. I would love to be able to sit down with you before the 21st, which I think is when our health department brings our budget health department presentation the 27th. It's not on. It'll probably be on September 4th or before the. B or C if if it's necessary. I will make it a priority for you and I to sit down before that date. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.

Thank you. Do a recap. Under resolutions, no items have been called out under bills for introduction. No items have been called out under bills for final consideration. Council Member Cunneen has called out Bill 818 for comments under pending. No items have been called out. Madam Secretary, please put the first item on our screens. All right, we've got it up. Council member each. Please go ahead with your comments. Thank you. Council President Gilmore And this bill is an extension of a current executive order we have that protects workers who are doing essential services on city property for things like janitorial, security, etc. to be able to keep their jobs if the contractor they work for changes over as the city periodically rebuilds that work. But it also expands those protections to essential workers in more categories, particularly many of the workers at our airport who do baggage or clean aircrafts or push passengers with disabilities. So all of those workers who really we rely on and we came to understand during this pandemic how essential they really are. They showed up to work when they needed to to keep things running, or many of them lost jobs, as we, you know, dialed down the amount of service we needed in buildings. So in many ways, they were impacted in both ways. These protections are common sense. They are efficient. They help to make sure that we keep the security protocols high and that our city runs efficiently. They're good for businesses because you kind of have a ready made workforce when you start over rather than losing people who want to find new jobs before their contract turns over. We talked about it at length at committee, but I wanted to call it out because I think for me personally, this bill is a sign not only of this council's commitment that the airport and the mayor's office and all the administrative agencies who partner with us to look at all the details. But it's our city's commitment that the important benefits of the airport and the important benefits really do need to flow to everyone. I know we talk a lot about gentrification on this council and we talk about it in the housing sphere. And, you know, really the truth is that a good paying job that you can keep is also an anti gentrification or displacement force. At one point, the airport found that at least about a quarter of the folks who worked at the airport lived in Denver. We know that we're an employer for the entire region and that's a good thing. You know, it's good that we have enough jobs for residents of many communities. But if you think about it, those workers, many of them who live in far northeast Denver, many of them who live in west Denver, they are in their neighborhoods facing those rising housing costs, facing all the other challenges we talk about. And their ability to keep their jobs sustainably is linked to their ability to stay in our city, too. And so I believe that if we're going to be comprehensive, right, in thinking about our airport as an economic agenda or engine, that these policies that make sure that the jobs, first of all, are good jobs. Right. With the wages we described. Second of all, are sustainable jobs with policies like worker retention. And then third of all are just jobs. Right. That they have good voices on the job, are not fired for organizing or for being engaged in activities that are protected, that those types of things are what make that economic engine valuable to the regular people of Denver who may not be frequent fliers. Right. It's valuable to all of us as passengers. But that economic engine piece has to mean something to the workers at all incomes. And so I think this completes the vision. Right, these types of policies that we've been addressing. And so I want to thank the workers who came to testify during committee, the staff and the folks who represent them from Unite Here and SEIU Local 105 And I share this with my colleagues at committee. But, you know, this is a union neutral policy. The majority of workers who are protected by it probably aren't represented by a union. But these are policies that really fill in those gaps for all of those workers and make sure that they're on a level playing field. And so for that, I'm really proud that it's on the consent agenda tonight. There will be no dramatic vote count here, but I thought it was important because of what these workers have been through over the last year, because of how really collaborative and meaningful this conversation was, where all the players in our city agencies and council members and workers where we're working together. I want to thank the airlines who participated in the conversation and gave us feedback that resulted in some changes, but I just thought it was worthy of comment before we passed it along in the consent agenda, I want to thank my colleagues for their support, especially you, President Gilmore, as the host of our airport, been very engaged in the conversation. So thank you to all and look forward to the consent vote. All right. Thank you very much, Councilmember Kinney, and likewise, want to thank the folks that are working at it, Dan, and the leadership at the airport as well. But then also, I would be remiss if I didn't thank you for your leadership and partnership, especially in working with Unite Here and SEIU as well, and so happy to support this tonight. It's important and it stabilizes our families in the community and also the airport as well. All right. Not seen any other items called out. That concludes that recap portion.

And I'm going to turn it over to Marva Sheehan with H.f. and each to walk you through that process and the results. And at the end of Marv's presentation, Marva Staff Ken, Kenny, Criswell, Busa and the team will be available for any questions that you may have. Thank you. Hello there. Good evening. At a mayor and council, Marva Sheehan partnered nature consultants. And I've been here for several years now. So every year or just first, we start with RCI, which provides your recycling solid waste and organics collection in the city for your residents, residences, businesses. And part of that agreement that is with the city is a rate setting process. And there are two methods that we use the index best method, which is every two years and then every third year is a detailed cost review. And this year was the year that we did the detailed cost review and we look at their actual cost and then come up with what we feel that are tied in with the requirements per the agreement and then compare that with estimated revenues and come up with the estimated or with the projected rate adjustment. At the conclusion of our report this year and after our work week came, that is a 7.31% increase. After discussions with staff and with RCI, we ended up deciding to use part of the Rate Stabilization Fund, which you had been accumulating each year, as well as funds from their bouncing account, which had our recycling revenues have been going into that fund. So this was a time to start using that. And then also in discussions with RCI on adjusting some of the cost in order to get to the number that we ended up with, that it ends up that the rates are going would be going up 4.21%, which is about what CPI had been. So it kind of ties in with that as well. With with that, there's a quarterly impact to the 32 gallon rate, which is the majority of your ratepayers of about $5, $20 for the year. So pretty insignificant when you think in terms of the amount of services and what your residents and businesses are receiving here. And as far as in comparison with the county, we had a rate survey that was part of your packet and you're still in a really good position again considering the level of service that you are receiving. And with that, I'll answer any questions that you have. So Counsel, do we have any questions? Councilmember Odie. I. Have a couple of. Thank you. So who did the heavy lifting on the negotiation? Do we know what that was? Who did you know. Who did the heavy lifting on on saving us from 7.3 to 4.3. Liam in our office worked with a C.I. on that. On that. Okay. So kudos to that person or persons. I just have a question. I'm just a little quick prefix. Preface, preface. Sorry, it's getting late. I'm on the Stop Waste Board and there was some discussion here in the staff report on Operation National Sword, and I know that's putting a lot of pressure on recycling and recycling rates. And I think there's some new regulation that came down, you know, from the state. Can we can somebody just talk a little bit about. Sure, I'll talk a bit on the recycling, then I'll let Kent talk, give you a little more from the company's perspective. Our our firm has been working with a lot different agencies dealing with National Sword and. Just audience members who may be listening. Do you want to explain that? That's kind of what I was hoping that we can. You know, because absolutely, you know, those of. Us in Stop Waste hear it. And by the way, Maria's here, she stuffs that with me and very excellent. So I just give a quick shout out to Maria. Great. So China back really at the end of 2017 put out basically that they were going to restrict the the types of materials that were they were going to be taking in part of China's efforts on clean air environment issues. So they implemented what we called National Sword. That's kind of the U.S. term for it. That went into effect March of 2018. That limited the types of materials they take. The probably more importantly is they set a standard for contamination and that it goes down to the point 5%, which is very, very small as far as contamination levels. Most I'm not sure there's a Merv that can really meet that level. So what happened is, as a result, material didn't go to China and therefore they had to find alternative markets. Last year when we were here, we were just right. Really in the early brinks of it, there was concerns about even finding places for the materials to go. And there was a thought of if people were going to have to landfill, what was going to happen to especially this is all predominately mixed paper and also in mixed paper. It only has a certain shelf life before it starts disintegrating. So there was lots of issues last spring and summer. Through that time they've kind of worked through, for the most part, materials. Being able to be moved is just that. The price where at one point they were getting over $100 a ton for it is now and I think can you can talk to it it's break even or having to pay a month ago I think they were paying $11 or so attempting to move it. It's going now to places like Pakistan and Vietnam and other sources, but they weren't set up for the amount of material to get there. And then part of the issue was, well, which was one that I hadn't thought of. There was we have a lot of ships coming this way from China with material. And so back hauling to China, getting load that way was fairly easy going to these other countries. We didn't have the same level of ship. So there was you might have a purchase order to get there, but you didn't you couldn't get containers in or ship to be able to get it there. So there was a lot that's been going on with that. But the biggest thing is the fact that the pricing on paper and cardboard has dropped dramatically. And so the and for you, your commodity revenue share went into this balancing account. So it hasn't impacted the rates as much at this point. But for a lot of agencies where they netted the revenues against the cost to process, it's coming back quite a bit. You want to give the companies perspective, okay. What's important? Let people know this because we're recycling more and more. And I think we should understand that, you know, there's some pressures, but we still want to keep doing it. Mayor Council My name is Ken Kenny. I'm the controller with HCI. The recycling market's really I'd sum up as spot market prices are very, very depressed. It's going to take a long time for them to recover. Again, as Marva said, the markets are shifting dramatically and it's just not the same as when China was taking the material . You know, again, $150 a ton for makes paper. Which was the. Bulk of the recycling that was being moved. Now we're at times paying to to move the material. The good news is we are moving material. We've not had to landfill anything. And we believe. We will continue to move material and it will just take a long time for the markets to mature and get back. The contamination issues mean we have to do more work to clean up the quality, to make the material marketable. And with that, that's really what it is, a spot market day to day, and it's going to take a long time to recover from that thing. Thank you. Thanks. Okay. Counsel, ready? Any further questions? I mean, is there any, you know, any long term policy implications of all of this that we need to consider as we go forward in our in our contracts? And I remember Oakland just, you know, sent out a bit maybe two or three years ago and there was a big sticker shock. Right. So I mean. Well, I think, you know, new contracts, what we're seeing now were for there were years ago contracts you got there's kind of a net revenue back to the city in a revenue share. It might be 20 or $25 a ton would come back to the city. That's obviously is gone. And then the contracts kind of went to a net zero where it said, okay, holla processor, you better risk reward, it's all yours. Now really what we're seeing is establishing a processing fee and looking at the revenue kind of separate and having kind of parameters and ways of how you're calculating at which you got your contract is kind of like that. You have a processing fee and you have a revenue share, so you're really kind of set ahead of the game from a lot of contracts. But that's really I think the key is, if I could stress anything to the residents is, you know, clean, keeping your materials clean that you'll get those those containers that clean and dry and then not keeping garbage out of the recycling is probably the best message that we could send in order to, because no matter what, the material's going to be clean. Thank you. Good advice. Okay. Councilmember Daisuke. Hi. Thank you for the report. By the way, I always like reading it. It's so very detailed and transparent, the way in which information is packaged and conveyed. The question that I have tonight is several days ago we council received an email about a resident concerned about theft of from blue bins, the recycling bins. So the question I have is, has RCI or the city quantified the amount of dollars we lose when recyclables are taken out of the blue bins by what I shall call street recycling entrepreneurs? So do we cause for? With regard to the impacts of changes in policy by the People's Republic of China, you seem to have quantified that impact on a something on the order of $25 a ton resulting from from China's change in policy. But when it comes to theft the is from from the blue bins do we know. Yeah. I'll have to defer to ECI and staff on that. I know from my background it's a very difficult number to capture because it's kind of you don't know what you don't know, but I'll defer to them. Okay. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the Council. Chris Melville, General Manager of ECI. Councilmember Desai. Specifically, we haven't done our quantitative analysis to understand the specific amount of revenue loss from these items, but they're typically the more valuable items the petty, the aluminum things that can be turned into the redemption centers for money. So it is a direct offset in revenue. That would be interesting to understand what the impact is on rates. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure to ask that question. Okay. I would like to also circle back real quick to Councilmember Ortiz question about contract elements that could have an impact on long term recycling costs and so forth. And one of the things to keep in mind right now is that recycling capacity is quite a valuable element, and you have three years or so left on this franchise agreement. And so as communities contemplate what's happening long term, it's important to consider if you want to have discussions about ramping up recycling capacity on a longer basis of something could be done now. It could impact or could have the effect of a rate smoothing effect. So you're not seeing these large jumps in future years. Thank you. Any further questions. For the controller? Yeah. I'm sorry. Jim. Mr. Judy. Sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. I think there were I also had a question about I think there were two bills that passed in Sacramento. I mean, just so the public is informed on what those are. Maybe you could just touch on those briefly, the impact. Sure. There are actually several, maybe 32, maybe 341. The most recent coming into full effect right now is HB 1383, which passed. It's actually a climate pollutant bill of greenhouse gas reductions, but has a significant element on, um, composting and food scraps. Recycling and things like that, has a tremendous amount of regulation attached to it that will have cost impacts associated with service. But again, we're happy to talk to the city and work through those things to lessen those impacts as much as possible. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Do we have any public comment? We do not have any speakers. Okay. Any further discussion? One more question. Councilmember de Desai. In the HFA report on page 14, at the very top there is a discussion there about profits and it reads as follows We found that ECI correctly calculated the allowable profit by applying a 90% operating ratio, i.e. approximately a 10% profit to its allowable operating cost. However, due to the calculated adjustments described above, we recommend an $88,800 decrease to Acres profit. So was that recommendation is that built into the the the the profit? I mean, the rate changes that we're contemplating? Absolutely. Okay. It's all it's basically a mathematical the first part, because we take their operating costs and calculate the profit, because we reduce their costs, that associated profit gets subtracted as well. So it ends up netting out. Yes. Okay. So it's okay. I was just responding to the word recommend. So I was wondering if it was not only recommended, but. It's included in the in the recommended way to just. Make you question. Any further counsel comments or questions. Okay. So what we're looking for is an adoption of a resolution establishing integrated waste collection ceiling rates and service fees for Alameda County Industries for period 18, which is July 2019 to June 2020. Do I have a motion to adopt this resolution? So moved. I have a motion to have a second. It's been moved by Vice Mayor Knox. Right. Seconded by Councilmember de Sung. May we have a voice vote, please? Yes. Councilman DeSantis? Yes. Knox White. Yes. Yes. Yes. Mayor. As Ashcraft. Yes. Okay. That carries the motion passes unanimously. The resolution is adopted. Thank you, everyone. All right. Moving on down the agenda. We are on agenda item six e.

This item was placed on the agenda at the request of Vice Mayor Knox White and Councilmember Odie. Okay, so which of you wants to take the lead? Okay. I could start. Okay. Councilmember Odie. I'm sorry. Public comment. I thought that was nice. So I'm so sorry. Had you not turned into speaker slip. You want to speak on the side of what they discussed? So did you want to speak on an item? Not on the agenda or on this one? This one. Okay, so we will have the item introduced and then we will have an opportunity for speakers. The item I called before, as we always give an opportunity for people who want to talk about something that's not on the agenda. And we didn't have any speakers on that. Okay. So we're in good shape. All right. So Councilmember. Odie. Oh, good. Thank you. So I think all of us recognize that gun violence is a public health epidemic. And to that end, the vice mayor and I are hosting a town hall. And so far we have a representative, we have our assembly member, Mr. Bonta, our state senator Nancy Skinner, and our district attorney, Nancy O'Malley speaking . You know, we're still working on other speakers, but our our goal out of this is to have a conversation on how we can best address this issue of gun violence, because it seems like every week somebody dies, somebody dies because somebody has an assault weapon. And if we say our thoughts are with you, that's not going to solve the problem. If we continue to just say platitudes, that's not going to solve the problem. And people are asking for action. And what the goal of this town hall would be to identify what specific actions we could do as individual citizens, what specific actions we could do as as a city, because there are some restrictions, but there are things we can consider. And then ultimately out of this would be, you know, maybe a laundry list of items that could be presented to the council that we could discuss and decide if we wanted to take any action on any of them. Like I said, there's a lot of state preemption, but there are there are things we could also do at the state and local level, like sponsor bills and make it make sure that, you know, maybe we give direction. I'm not saying we do this tonight, but one of the options could be, you know, we decide our federal lobbyist sponsors a bill in Washington or in Sacramento. So, you know, we'd like to have the city's blessing and, you know, be able to, you know, well, everyone's invited anyway, but, you know, agenda is it and allow staff to spend some time working on it and making sure it's very productive. But you know, what I hear from everybody that I talked to is that enough of the inaction? So we're going to take action. We'd like support. And I think this is a topic that's very timely. And I will kick it over to the vice mayor to add anything that he wants to add. Vice Mayor Knox, why did you want to add anything? No, I think. It was a fabulous summation. Thank you. Any questions from council before we hear from our public speaker? Okay. And we have one public speaker in Salem, Gordon Terrace, please. Hi. I'm Gordon Terrace. So if I could get you to speak right into the microphone, everyone will be able to hear you, including those who are watching on television. Okay. I'm Gordon Terrace. I'm a citizen here at Alameda. I was also a four year all-American rifle shooter in the NCAA ways and a candidate of the 84 Olympics. I would like to volunteer to help you in any way we can. Shooting is an Olympic sport. There are men, women, coed, individual team and Paralympic options. It's also an NCAA sport. Shooting provides scholarships and about 30 colleges and universities around the country. It is a coed sport and some teams are women. All me. As I said, I'm a I'm already a product of an NCAA program. It's a sport of mental discipline and fine motor skill. It's also a sport where men and women compete equally and where accommodations are built in to enable handicapped people to be equally. It is not a sport that selects primarily on physical power. Is a sport available for people who don't have access to other sports? As the coach of the local junior rifle team. My goal is to provide opportunities for youth in their prep years to prepare for college scholarships and Olympic opportunities. Our current state laws hinder our ability to provide that service. So I would like to participate to make sure unanticipated consequences of our actions don't hinder opportunities for people to also have their own opportunities. So that's why I want to volunteer to help. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, let's open this up to council discussion. Councilmember Vella, would you like to start? Yeah. So I think that unfortunately, the issue of gun violence has been a fairly timely and relevant kind of ongoing for the for the past few years due to the number of mass shootings that we've had and in in this country. I do also I guess my my question is, um, we have had some town halls. In fact, I think the Mayor and I both participated in one, um. The Episcopal Church. Here. And so I am kind of cognizant of, or a little wary of kind of reinventing the wheel. And I do know that we've also sponsored or not sponsored, but supported a number of different bills that have been carried, I think, both federally and statewide. So I guess my question is, um, you know, kind of getting out and you talked about this a little perhaps having some, you know, coming back with some suggestions or something like that. There was a there has been kind of a very involved conversation with community leaders, and I would hate to kind of throw that out and start all over again. So I guess my question is, what's the context of this meeting? I think the issue of addressing gun violence is fairly broad. And you mentioned that there's going to be a number of different, you know, elected officials from various levels. So obviously, there's a limit to what the city can do. So I guess my question and I think also when we had the town hall that we participated in, there was a long like a long laundry list of kind of the regulations that we currently have in Alameda. And so I guess I'm just wondering what the the goal for this meeting is as it relates specifically to the city and then who from staff would have to be involved if we're sanctioning it, if if that's the request. And then if I could just. I didn't mean to cut you off. Do you think so? Um, I do know, because I've been signing a lot of letters lately, and. And I think the council is aware to that. Well, starting with the, you know, there was that cluster of three mass shootings all at once. And Gilroy, California was one of them. And I think El Paso, Texas and Ohio. Dayton, Dayton, Ohio. And so the U.S. Conference of Mayors, of which I am a member, it's the mayors of medium and large cities where Medium City sent out a letter or asked for mayors around the country to sign on to a letter urging. This was during the the summer break some. A recess of the Congress, but asking Mitch McConnell to call the Senate back into session to take up gun safety legislation. And so today, 281 of us mayors have signed on. And to date, Senator McConnell has refused to take any action. But one thing I often tell people is that we do live in California, which has some of the most progressive gun safety legislation in the country. We really are a model to other other states. And and we've got a great attorney general in Sacramento who's taking on the administration in DC on a regular basis. But we do have a legislative agenda that the council approves. And I just want you to know that just this legislative session we have authored support letters to committee chairs, Senate Assembly and Senate floor alerts, and authored support letters to the governor on 11 state gun control reform bills. And I'm going to go over them really quickly. AB 12 extends the duration of an issued gun violence restraining order from one year to a period of 1 to 5 years. Abby, 61, allows an employer or coworker or an employee or teacher in a post-secondary school to file a petition requesting a gun violence restraining order. ab1 64 prohibits an individual subject to an out of state restraining order injunction from possessing, receiving, purchasing or attempting to do all of that of a firearm in California. If the out of state order is equivalent in its prohibitions, AB 339 requires law enforcement agencies to develop and adopt policies and standards regarding the use of gun violence . Restraining Orders. AB 340 Identifies Best Practices, New Strategies and recommendations for reporting requirements of gun violence reduction. Pilot programs in Alameda County is one of the participating counties. AB 879 requires the sale of firearm precursor parts to be conducted through a licensed firearms precursor part vendor. AB 1297 requires requires rather than authorizes a city or county licensing authority issuing a concealed firearm license to charge an applicant a sufficient licensed processing fee and deletes the current $100 fee. AB 1493 authorizes an individual who's the subject of a gun violence restraining order to petition to the court voluntarily relinquishing his or her. Firearms. Rights. Believe it or not, that doesn't exist. Currently, AB 1669 applies the same gun show regulations that apply to firearms dealers, to ammunition vendors. SB 61 prohibits a person from applying to purchase more than one firearm of any kind within any 30 day period, and specifically prohibits the application to purchase more than one long gun within a 30 day period unless the person has a valid hunting license. And beginning January one, 2021, prohibits the sale of a semiotic semiautomatic rifle to persons under the age of 21. S.R. 61 urges the United States Congress to enact an assault weapons ban following recent mass shootings. The city also supports federal gun control legislation, including H.R. 11, 12 and S 42, which would provide stronger background checks for gun purchases. As Councilmember Odie noted, cities are limited in what we can do. And by the way, i. R Assembly member Rob Bonta is the author, coauthor of I think a couple of the pieces of legislation I just read. I'm also concerned with duplicating staff efforts. We are sending our staff in a lot of different directions to staff various events. I'm wondering if there might be a way to possibly fold the idea use. First of all, I would certainly not say that we have just been issuing platitudes. I think what we are doing is encouraging stronger legislation, even at the state level and certainly at the federal level, because we can have the most progressive gun laws in the state of California. And as with the Gilroy shooting, that individual purchased his gun legally in the state of Nevada and brought it into California. So we need to also lobby for stronger federal action. We, of course, are blessed with some of the most progressive federal representatives in in Sacramento, in Washington, D.C., but nonetheless, coming up. In November is the United Against Hate campaign that is Bay Area wide, probably beyond the Bay Area. Actually, the week of November 17 to 22 community members are encouraged to participate in events, to raise awareness, to spark actions, to stop hate bird inclusion. Gun violence is among the topics that would be considered, and some of the innovative ideas are sponsoring a movie viewing. And there's there's a whole list of potential movies and book clubs. There's there are some books that are very, you know, innovative, inspiring to to read and kind of unite readers around these topics. And I'm wondering if there might be room to perhaps get council member Odie and Vice Mayor Knox White. Do you want to perhaps fold what you're trying to do into this united against hate campaign? And then I do also want to hear from Councilmember de SAC and Councilmember Vela. Yeah. And I had the question about, I guess, who from staff are they looking okay, work on this. And then also there was significant work done by Christ Episcopal Church members of the congregation. I think Sarah and Eleanor and Galen and Galen, there was another faith leader that worked on it. And so there was a lot of work done by them also to kind of review the status of kind of where we are from at the state level, where we are at the federal level. And then what Alameda specifically has done and Police Chief Ray Larry also participated in that panel and also did a significant amount of work and research in terms of kind of outlining all of the things that that we've done throughout in time as a city. And so I think part of it and if if the goal is to kind of maybe take all of that work that was done and kind of share it to let people know, hey, this is what Alameda has on the books currently in terms of our legislation and our ordinances, so that people aren't kind of just throwing ideas out there without necessarily understanding the foundation and framework for what exists. And I don't want to I also think that it's important and this was important work that was done, and I want to highlight this. It was done by a very, very active and involved group of women. And I, I don't think that this was an intentional thing of kind of just ignoring the work that was done. But I think oftentimes this work gets done and then sometimes we lose the fact that it happened just because time has passed, but it doesn't mean that it doesn't exist or that it wasn't done. So I just want to make sure that we recognize it and find a way to fold that in if we do move forward. And I like the idea of combining events to. Okay, I can't find. A lot to unpack there. I think I was accused of ignoring work that was done because it was done by women. So that was a little offense. I was a little offended by that. Okay. Why don't we just stick to the topic at hand? No. Well, I mean I mean, I will say I mean, as far as the staff, I mean, we have no I mean, I don't want to speak for you, John. You could jump in. I mean, I don't think we have any problem building on the work that someone else has done. And the whole idea of what the city can do and can't do. I mean, that's where we would involve the city attorney's office. And then, you know, there might be some publicity assistance, you know, with social media and, you know, fliers or whatever and, you know, maybe a little noticed thing. I mean, it wasn't we didn't intend on this to be a full blown staff thing. And, you know, I listen to that. And I got to ask, what affected that letter that you sent to Senator McConnell? Have nothing. And that's what people are sick of. People are sick of writing letters and getting nothing done. They want us to do something. And this is our opportunity to do something. Now, we don't exactly know what that is, but I can tell you, sitting around and reading a book and having a book club, it's not going to stop people. We there was a comment made that we had the strictest gun laws are the best gun laws in in the state or in the country. But then Gilroy still happened. And that work that all those people did a year ago, it's just sat on the shelf. Nothing has been done at the city level to promote it. Nothing has been done to publicize it. People on social media don't even know it's out there. And this is something this is a public health crisis and we need to act on it and we need to do something as a city. And then I heard a comment that we had the best gun laws, but then there was 12 rattled off. So if we had the best gun laws, there wouldn't have been 12. Really good idea. Years that came out of this year's legislative session. So there still is an opportunity for us to work on solving this crisis and solving this problem. And I appreciate the offer of assistance from the gentleman who spoke. But, you know, reading books and writing letters that go nowhere are not going to stop people from getting killed. I mean, to be brutally honest with you, it's going to take people doing something and they're looking at us, their leaders, to do something and to sit up here and, you know, have the idea kind of dismissed. You know, I think it's offensive to all those people that are out there looking looking at us, looking at us , their leaders, to stop the talk, stop the thoughts, stop the letters, stop the prayers and actually get something done. So I just want to interject a thought here that no one was accusing you. I'm quite sure, of ignoring ideas put forth by women that women do do a lot of good work. But amazingly, as far as as far as Mitch McConnell and Councilmember O'Day, you've been around politics as long as I have. And you worked at the state level. I think we both know that it's going to take a change in in Washington, some some election changes and some time excuse me, still talking, still have the floor. Sometimes the key among those 281 mayors were Republican mayors and sometimes Republicans. Listen to Republicans. I mean, I'm from California, but nonetheless, I wanted in I knew my council wanted us to be counted in that letter. I was not suggesting that we just sit around and read books, but I am unclear on the concept of what you're proposing. You're saying that just talking isn't going to make a difference, but I think a town hall involves talking. And as far as the laws in California, it's hard to measure a negative. But I do believe that our laws have made a difference, and I think we could both agree that even good laws can be improved upon and can be supplemented. And I think this is one of those areas that we don't need to pit one another against each other. I think we want to work collectively toward a solution. But I, I am just I'm mindful of staff time. I'm wondering if we could, you know, merge events because I think the United Against Hate campaign that's been around a few years is a worthy one. But with that, I see that Councilmember Desai hasn't been heard from yet. Well, thank you. It seems as though, you know, two sets of council members are extremely energized, and rightfully so, by the subject matter of dealing with gun violence. You know, I think within the purview of the Brown Act, I think there's room for for the different council member sets of council members to pursue the issues in. I mean, perhaps once one set of council members might deal with gun use intervention, you know, design policies and local policy and strategies regarding gun use intervention. And, you know, we we hear so much nowadays about, quote unquote, red flag. I don't know if that's the right word. Another set of issues that, you know, a councilman set of another set of council members might be interested in a set of policies regarding gun violence prevention, which has that hold dear, has a whole other set of and I think within the world of the Brown Act, I think it could be accommodated or not. You know, we'll have the city attorney tell us one way or another. So I think, you know, keep those those options open. You know, there's a lot of different sector by which you can approach this. Um. So Councilmember Villa. I guess my might ask is how is this different from the town hall or how is it going to incorporate how is it going to incorporate the work that was done? Because we did do an accounting of kind of the steps that the city itself has taken. And I think that's why I'm asking what's the what's the question that's being asked? We can have a town hall, we can have a meeting at any time. And and what we found, I think, at the meeting that we had was there was a lot of Q&A that happened. And it wasn't just one meeting. There were follow up meetings that occurred that both the mayor and I attended and that I believe Police Chief Hillery also attended. And so I think that, you know, if it's looping in additional people, I mean, that was a packed room. It was a huge crowd that came out over. 100 on like a monday night competing with Monday night football. Right. So I think, you know, if it if it's to build off of of that or if it's I think, you know, if you're talking. About, you know, having a forum where people can come and talk to their state legislators to say, what's the state of California doing? I heard you mentioned that. I think I'm just trying to understand what the what the goal here is. You're saying it's it's to not just talk about it. But I also understand that there is a limit to what the city can do. And I think we tried to do kind of an accounting of what we have done and if there was any emerging legislation that was local legislation that we could work on. But I also think to Councilmember Desai's point, there's nothing stopping us from working on these things and bringing back the ideas to say, look, here's the actual initiative, like here's the referral with the initiative attach that we're asking the city to consider. And I'm just kind of wondering about staff time as a whole. So I mean, I'm totally open to, to having us consider implementation of an ordinance if there's some sort of ordinance that suggested or recommended. But I also think that adding another event and with short notice, I'm just worried about the the the impact to staff and what what then gets kind of put on the wayside for us to to do that. Okay. Well, I think John and I, we're going to do most of the heavy lifting, as we've done already. And we did actually have a discussion with the police chief and the city attorney about this, you know, very brief, you know, but I think the police chief was supportive of this idea, the idea to gather our representatives , you know, at the local level who are doing good work in our district attorney and our representatives at the state level who are doing good work, and our assembly member and our senator. And I would I will speak for John, but I think we I will speak for myself. I'm more than happy to build on what's already been done and not have to reinvent the wheel, because I don't want to start over from scratch because I don't think we have time to start over from scratch. But, you know, I think the city's role should be limited to making sure that, you know, having the city. Okay. Yeah. Having the city attorney, you know, make sure that, you know, whatever we're doing, you know, it's legally allowed because, for instance, there are things we just can't do. And then a little publicity help from our Arpaio as far as getting the word out, you know, which I don't I don't think it's that much work. I mean, we could take care of, you know, setting up the speakers, you know, organizing the logistics. Well, we haven't figured that out yet. Maybe there might be some assistance with staff, might be able to use a public building if if if it was sanctioned. So I'm just I'm just a little bit stunned at the resistance. I just really am. I mean. So and I want to hear from the vice mayor, but I'd like to start with the end in mind. What what is it that you're hoping to accomplish? Well, I think it'd be an action plan that we could implement as a city, and that if I mean it, it could include legislation that we could pass. It could include legislation that or an action plan that we could sponsor. It could include ways to motivate citizens to take you know, to have their voice heard. Because, I mean, granted, this has been done, but it's been a year and nothing's been done. So, I mean, I granted there was a lot of legwork done already, but, you know, there's not a lot of organization and energizing. And, you know, I'm happy to be the one, you know, spearheading that. But I don't think staff has to be the one doing that. But, you know, there are some supports that, you know, we were hoping to get. And, you know, I honestly we were also hoping on getting a blessing that this council would agree that, you know, gun violence is a public health crisis. So and by not by choosing to not get involved, you know, it it just kind of perpetuates the inaction, in my view. Councilmember Vela And then let's hear from the vice mayor. I don't think that we're choosing to not get involved. I think that we've actually taken a very active stance in terms of supporting different legislation, in terms of our legislative, in terms of what we've actually directed our lobbyists to look out for and to and to bring forward so that we can actually actively support. I also think that, you know, some of the things that stemmed from this, where there was student action that occurred that was pretty substantial. Um, I think we can all remember that there was a student action that, that gathered outside of the, the. Um. The state of the city event last year. A year ago. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I think that there has been continued action. I just want to make sure that we're folding in the various groups that have been working on this continuously. And I think sometimes and part of the. Conversation that did occur were different things that individuals could do and actions that they could take as individual citizens. And so sometimes it's not that it has to be officially sanctioned, like they're going to go they have to act through us. There have been things going on. And I think that it you know, I think that there are groups out there that are that have taken what we what was discussed and have done something with it. So I don't want to discount that. I think, you know, if you're asking us to to make some sort of declaration, then then, you know, put that before the council so that we can vote on it. But I think that I guess I'm just unclear in terms of what the the outcome that we're looking for based off of what was attached to the referral . Let's hear from the vice mayor who's coauthor of this council referral. Are you there, Councilman? I'm vice mayor and that's my leg. The reason I keep shutting the operative I'm trying to go to unmuted. Hi. High technology. So I. I think I guess I will answer that question, but I like the opportunity to kind of make my comment that from the very beginning it was been a very interesting conversation. And I mean, I think, you know, it'd be from my perspective and from everybody and correct me if it is disturbing that you and I started talking about what we wanted to do in working on something, and we really wanted to make sure that we weren't getting so far ahead of this, that it's something we were stepping out and trying to be the only two people working on this issue. And so we wanted to kind of come back in and knowing that we were going to have to ask for some help in Washington, whatever else. So we were going to ask the council if they had something with great idea, let them do that so that we can start a more regular conversation at the council. I know for myself, you know, with. September 9th and we didn't get to talk about what was going on. And I can't remember the last time the city got put off the body and has addressed this issue in terms of the role of the city. And so but not all of it could have happened out there. And I think that there's lots of room or a lot of room to do, lots of work, lot there. And that I you know, I agree that there is a place for, you know, to get paid moving through red that we need to talk about understanding that we need to go motivated advocates around the community taking whatever role. But I do think that at this point in time, in terms of the issues of action, we haven't had that conversation. And I think we have to what I think we would have done all is to sit down and have a conversation, you know, with people who are energized around this draft and to talk about what are the actions that city can take. So not so much to start another convention where we're doing really great and in the case of action. But I don't think there's value in combining DC because I don't think the United States is looking to help the problem to make change in Alameda specifically. I'm sure they'd be very supportive of it. So I offer my point by point of view. I think. The realism is times. It says it's still time. I'm stunned. That's interesting. Oh, well, he's not talking, so she stopped it. But okay, you and I, should we hang up and try? We can hang up. And. Vice Mayor, can you hear us? The mystery. Which we just will hang up and try back to see if we can get a signal. It wasn't my fault. I can't hear you guys. Or hear us, but we couldn't hear you. Okay. Okay. If you. You were where I stopped typing. You were saying you don't see the value of combining the two events. You got to give value combining to the value of there being able to go back and downgrade. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you are you are engaged in that and as an individual person. And, you know, I don't see that that that needs to happen in my mind to be something that the citizens doing remain engaged city and the council thinks they can't. And I think that they're definitely going to continue the population. Real quickly, I just want to address the that this council has never addressed gun violence. I know we did a moment of silence after the Gilroy shooting and I said, you know, yet another shooting. I didn't say that. And if I could just finish my comment. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know that yet. He's got the floor. Yeah, no, I didn't. I thought it was. Please. I just I didn't I didn't say the council had not done anything about it, not to my knowledge. You know, they hate campaign and hate that we've adopted in the city's campaign about gun violence, but we're not going to vote on that forward. How we want to do that. And I think, Councilmember, I mean, I just really thought this town hall as any place we could be, a place where people can bring their thoughts and ideas and happy to engage anybody who's done anything at all and then come back with some ideas, with our ideas. But also, obviously, an individual council member can bring their ideas as well. And we can have a big conversation at the council about what might make sense and how we might move forward. Yes. Uh huh. That was it. Okay. Um. So, um, anybody want to I whatever is done, i, i, i do think there's value in checking in. It sounds like neither Councilmember Oti or Vice Mayor Knox White perhaps attended the the town hall at the Episcopal Church because it seemed to cover a lot of the the the topics. But that's not to say you couldn't do the same thing again or, you know, updated to 2019. But okay. So what do we what do we think council? I mean, there's no reason to do rework. So I mean, I'm happy to connect with anybody as we finalize the logistics that wants to participate or invite anyone who's done work to give their perspective or provide research or whatever. I mean, it's not to reinvent the wheel. I think you find them valuable resources. I well, I, you know, I reached out to resources that I thought were valuable that are on the ground doing this. You know, the police chief, the district attorney, the assembly member, the senator. And if there's more I mean, this is not something that I don't think I can solve. So I'm happy to hear a variety of opinions and get a lot of input. And. You know, of like there are. People vice mayor here, but. We did get the names of and make sure that. Yeah, their voices continued. Into the program. Sure. The Giffords Law Center, you know, we're reaching out to them to see if they could provide some assistance, you know, so the city attorney doesn't have to do all the research. And a lot of this is done already. So but there's you know, there seems to be a gap in communication between a lot of people and what was done a year ago. And as the vice mayor said, you know, between anything that's been done here except for moments of silence and with all due respect, those don't solve the problem. We also. Councilmember Villa in the microphone. To our legislative priorities in terms of we did also talk about that and that was agenda where we said specifically that we wanted to support legislation around gun control, gun regulation and addressing gun violence. So there has been action from that. I mean, a large part of it was that essentially there wasn't much we could do as a city. There's been a lot of regulations that that were discussed that have happened at the local level. But it becomes an enforcement issue and a feasibility issue and an efficacy issue. So I think if if the goal is to not just engage in platitudes, I also don't want to have something come back to us that's going to result in not being effective. I'm out of time. So I council member decided. I see your hint. I did not know. Okay. I'm free to use my time. You're trying to has it? I mean, that's why you want to have this discussion. So there can be a level set on expectations and people can understand because you asked to come in person on the street or on social media, and they they don't have any idea what what we're allowed to do, what we're not allowed to do. And there's just a lot of angst out there. Councilmember Desai has found his voice. So I think I think residents, especially mothers and fathers, would want their city hall to be actively engaged. I think there's a lot of specific things that we can do as a city hall that throw out a policy discussions that are happening at the federal and state level. But our city of Alameda specific, while I won't get into that, I think, you know, those kind of discussions are worth having. I mean, there's big five really have to sell. Weapons. And near the counter there. When you go down to South Shore and Big Five, I don't know. So I think I think the residents want us to have specific conversations. And I know the Episcopal Church, I think that was one of the issues that the Episcopal Church and it would be nice to see, you know, some kind of resolution of that. But so I think let's have it because the residents want us to. Have it, that emotion. And this is yours. And I would just add that the topic of the big five did come up, and what they're selling are hunting rifles. They don't sell automatic or semiautomatic weapons. If you know, someone wanted to launch that campaign to get them to stop selling hunting rifles, I guess we just have to ask, does that that's . Not agenda is today's okay. We're not talking about specific specific items or retailers or whatever. So you're right. So that was something that came up at the town hall. Right. Mm hmm. I knew. I knew that. So. So it wasn't. They want us to. Well, I'd like to move approval of the. Of the referral. Vice Mayor. Michael. I like to think it, but it doesn't have a certain type. I thought i heard it did y. October 14th. That was my other question. Why people? Why indigenous peoples? Because that's the only that I could get the the three elected officials together at the same time. Well, you know, let me just. Councilmember Desai. Councilmember Jim Modi is asking, along with vice mayor, they're asking a very direct request for us to basically give our blessings or endorse the upcoming October 14th. To me. Okay, let's do that. On that thing, I think if other council members are interested in pursuing their slice of this issue, you know, let's let's let's also move forward on that. But for now. Yeah. That's. I, I got to support it. I think we all have a responsibility to our constituents to address this issue. I'm going to just call on the city manager. I'm just going to add one logistics issue. Just based on this level of discussion, I'm guessing that there could be more than two council members at this town hall. If that's true, then we will need to address that as a regular meeting. I would hope so. I would hope there's more than two. So we'd have to jeopardize it that way as a council meeting. If we make a city, if we make it a city meeting. That is true. If it's approved tonight. Even if it's not. Yeah. If you're talking about an item that could come back to the council. Yeah, we've done that before. Yeah, I just want to. I just want to bring up that logistics. Just everyone. Aware. I think I mentioned that in my opening. And what about staff time, Mr. Leavitt? Um. I'm getting a sense all you're looking for that you two are going to be organizing it and all you're looking for is more like communications. Is that what I'm hearing? Outreach. And then, you know, well, if we could use a city location, that would be great. And then, you know, any legal support on. But like I said, the Giffords center has done a lot of this work already. So. So the legal support would be more the city attorney's legal office. We could probably do some work on it. I just ask everyone to be sure to speak right into your microphone so the audience can hear. Mr. CHEN. Yes. If the Council does provide the direction tonight, we are prepared to provide high level analysis for the whole council. We are probably going to have to look at it on a high level because there's so much going on and provide more of an overview than specifics. And you should thank you. That would be perfect. Thank you. And Councilmember Daza, I. Guess my one request, as you pursue this and as staff assist you, is what are the specific things that City Hall can do to deal with prevent, you know, the type of things that happened in Gilroy, etc.? El Paso and Dayton. I mean, if there are things that we can do, I mean, I know that that that would be my subject, too. Well. I mean, that's the question we want to answer through this. So I think that's. I can commit to that. Hmm. Okay. Um, so and I the the caveat I would request, I think has been stated before is that you do touch base. I mean, you talking to the police chief, he was certainly on that panel. You can talk to your colleague, Councilmember Vela. She was on the panel. Well, not. Really, no, because it's a Brown act. You know. So consult with the police chief. But anyway, and and I can. We've started getting done that once already. Yeah. Or give Eric names or even. And we can get them from you. From him. Okay. All right. So there has been a motion to support this this council referral to hold that a town hall event as described, and it's been seconded all in favor of approving this council referral. Have a voice vote. Any more discussion. On. You know, accounts of every day side? One thing I would suggest is to obtain the lessons learned from the discussions via the Episcopal Church, because if there's some policy implications there that make sure to make sure that your guys obtained the lessons learned from the Episcopal Church process. So I hate doing rework if it's already been done, if anyone doesn't know that. So. Okay. And Madam Clerk, you were saying something. Are you ready to do the voices? Okay. Councilmember Desai should not slight fire. Odie. Would you say? Oh, yeah, sure. Yes. Bella. Yes. Mayor as the Ashcraft? Yes. Okay. By five. Okay. All right. That motion passes. Thank you. Okay. We go on to item number ten. Council, Communications, Council and Communications. Let's start with let's start with the vice mayor up there while we've got him on the line. Any council communications.","Consider Addressing Gun Violence by Sanctioning a Town Hall Event on October 14, 2019, and Creating a Subcommittee to Organize the Event and Create Policy Options for Council Discussion.

Agenda Item nine Council Bill 119 352 Wellington City Department Amending Ordinance 125 493 The committee recommends the bill pass. Spring BAGSHAW. Thank you very much. This is the supplemental ordinance with summary details. One moment, please. We are still back. I just want to make sure I've got the right materials here in front of me. Take your time. There's a lot of material going through, so. Thank you. I just don't want to lose all of this. Okay. Thank you. All right. So this is our $17.4 million budget transfer. So, Seattle City Light presented budget change to Art Committee for $17.4 million. This was really associated with their large capital project. And after they had gone through their project planning, they learned that there was an additional growth in our city of about 8000 more advanced meters that were added to the AMI purchase. The whole project was forecasted as being $84.1 million, which was within their budget plus last year. And then as a result, when you do the math that they needed to transfer $17.4 million in 2018, it's not a hit on our general fund. The money will be transferred from within existing resources to cover the budget changes. And we grilled them fairly hard about why did this happen. Many of us read about the failure to add sales tax in the original project. They had an explanation for why that happened. They've also put in procedures to make sure that it doesn't happen again. So with 14.7 million for the meter installation and another 2.7 for systems I.T. and licensing, that brings up the total of the 17.4 million they would like to transfer. And the committee recommends that they be that request be approved. Very good. Any comments or questions, Councilman Gonzalez? Thank you, Council President. I just wanted to thank the chair of the Finance and Neighborhoods Committee for allowing me an opportunity to be one of the individuals who was grilling the department around some of the additional allocations and appropriations that they were requesting. One of the concerns that I had expressed during committee was around what looked to be and is in fact a shifting of dollars from the city's led streetlight conversions program and also some funding that had been previously allocated to doing some right of way improvements. And my concern that the appropriation that was being suggested that we're about to take action on today would have a disproportionate impact on neighborhoods or communities who had been waiting for the LED conversion to occur in their neighborhoods. Of course, this is an important program for public safety reasons and livability concerns. I just wanted to report to my colleagues that I was able to work with the Seattle City Light Agency to get confirmation that this action that the full council is about to take will not affect the deployment of the led street light conversions and that the contractor who is performing the LED lamp conversions is in fact fully funded within this program through the end of the year. So it I'm comfortable voting in support of this bill at full council today with the reassurance from Seattle City Light that this will not have a disproportionate impact on neighborhoods who've been waiting for this infrastructure to come to their neighborhoods. And with the understanding that and the representation that from that agency that all 2018 planned replacements will be completed in 2019, even with this budget transfer. Very good. Any further comments? Just that, Councilmember Gonzales, you nailed that. Thank you very much for bringing it up and following it up. Okay. No further comments.

The committee recommends the bill passes amended. Being very much transparent. Johnson thinks we in 2016 adopted an update to our comprehensive plan and within that we adopted a level of service standard that relies on what the industry would call a multimodal level of service. It sets a series of targets for reducing the number of folks that are driving alone, living in our neighborhoods throughout the city, and set some goals for those targets. The action that we contemplate today would implement those level of service standards in neighborhoods throughout the city and do it in a way that would require residential uses with more than 30 unique 30 dwelling units, nonresidential uses with greater than 4000 square feet of gross floor area or nonresidential uses, and industrial zones that have more than more than 30,000 square feet of gross floor area. To start to propose ideas for folks to be able to get to and around those uses without needing to have a car. Those kinds of ideas will take effect in an associated joint director's role, but it could include things like subsidizing transit passes, providing sidewalk improvements, or limiting the amount of parking that's provided on site. It also specifies thresholds that some projects are required to go through impact studies related to transportation that are more projects will be going through this than current. We are required to do so under the State Environmental Policy Act. So a complicated technical piece of legislation, but one with an under arching objective of trying to ask developers to pay more to the city, to allow for folks that are living or working in their units to be able to get around without needing to have a car. Very good. But ask for your support. Any questions or comments? Councilmember Herbold. Thank you. I just want to speak to some of the concerns that we heard during public comment today. We also heard similar concerns during the committee process in Councilmember Johnson's plus committee. And what we learned through that process is that mitigation of transportation impact impacts for downtown development. As a matter of policy is limited currently to programmatic measures. So there is CPA review for downtown projects. And the the one that is the the mitigation that is most often used are transportation management plans. In addition, development regulations in themselves create disincentives for single occupancy vehicle use downtown. Specifically, there are parking maximums for commercial development. There are floor area ratio disincentives for the provision of above grade parking. And there is a development standard where the there's a limit of floors above grade parking and there is also a limit on the on on requirements regarding screening. Thank you, Catherine Herbold.

Yes. Thank you, Madam Mayor. You know, in the past, I have recuse myself on anything related to the Pacific Pinball machine, even though this is something on the base, they do. I think their headquarters is Webster Street near my place. So I'll maybe just to be consistent, I'll recuse myself from this thing. Or did you want an opinion for from the city attorney or. Oh. Sure, sure. That's fine. Yes, Mr. Chan. I think in. Previous conversations with Mr. De Keyser, he he is indicated to me that because of the proximity of his home to the headquarters of this particular business, that recusal is appropriate. And I have no objections. And I appreciate Mr. de Thor. Informing me of his living location. Okay. Thank you. Okay, then. So, Councilmember Desai, we will excuse and recuse for this time. Excuse you as you recuse yourself. All right. And so who from city staff is presenting, huh? Like magic. There's Ms.. Mchunu. Good evening. We say. See her name and Lisa maxwell. Good evening. And I expect that we'll see their lovely faces. So there's one now. Coming. I'm coming. Sorry. That's all right. Good evening. There you are. Hi. All right. Good evening. Sorry. Sorry. We were having technical difficulty. As we worked him out. No worries. It's all good. So I'm just. Whoever I'd like to start, please start. I'll start. This is the almost exact same staff report that the council considered at the time of the council meeting. I'm presenting it to tenants who would like to participate in the rent relief program that the council approved in October. These are applicants for the the program that's specific to non-profits in Spirit's Alley. These are Spirit's Alley tenants. And and while the Civic Pinball Museum is a nonprofit. Just to quickly recap, this is the. 933 program. Which is the tenant is able to defer red for nine months and repay the rent over a. Three. Year period of time. If they repay early, they could have up to three months of rent abated. So what you're considered what you see in front of you is what three. Months rent would be for each of these tenants, the maximum amount, which is $42,225. Which I was. Doing the math. Which would mean that of the $400,000 that the council has allotted for this program, if you approve these tenants tonight, you will have allocated or we we could conceivably abate up to 156,357. And so it's less than half of what you've appropriated. And it would, as you will have, as did ten tenants. And I believe that you also noted in the staff report that this money would come from the base reuse fund and that revenues are actually doing better than anticipated. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. I think what I say what I'm saying is that a fund balance is pretty healthy and it could absorb this program as well as the loan conversion program that the council approved in October. So the appropriation that you made for both programs are definitely we're able to handle those and keep operations at the same level . Okay. Um, okay. Great. Any any clarifying questions from council? This next one that you want to. Oh, I think I see the city manager's hand to doing. Mr. LEVITT. Yeah. So I just want to add a little bit to what Nanette said. Yes. I think we have a healthy fine balance now, obviously, with the stress on the businesses out there. We are concerned about future lease revenue, or at least I'm concerned about future lease revenue, although I think these programs are to help to try to stabilize the businesses will help, which will hopefully help the city in the long term. But we are keeping an eye on the lease revenue as we move forward into the future. Thank you. And Ms.. Maxwell, did you want to add anything? The only thing. I'd add if there were any concerns. About know we had added. Some language. With respect to Koven. Compliance and if anyone had any particular concerns about that and wanted to raise them. We have some thoughts on how we can address those concerns if there were those. Well, that was my request and I feel pretty firmly about it. Okay. I because, you know, the reason that our businesses and our residents are many of them are suffering so much financially, psychologically is because of COVID 19. And certainly we've had some great news on the horizon recently with the vaccinations arriving and starting and more on the way. But it's going to take a while before we get enough people vaccinated to to really make a difference. And so in the intervening time, we have to adhere to the public health officer's guidelines. And I was certainly satisfied with the language in the in the amendment because it would take an actual violation, which which is something that comes after education after warning. So it's not like the first time out of the gate that I just think we have to be really consistent with our messaging and we want to help our businesses out, but they have to help themselves and others in the community.

Thank you for the members of the community for joining us this evening. We're going to move on to our next hearing. Councilmember Sandoval. Will you please put Council Bill 21, dash 1526 on the floor for final passage. And move that council bill 21 1526 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 21, Dash 1526 is open and we're going to have the staff report here. And I believe we have Kara on joining us. Or it might be Jenny and Borg. I'll let you introduce yourselves. I can you hear me and see the screen? Yes. Okay, good. My name is Karen. I work with Landmark Preservation in Community Planning and Development, and I am petitioning for my colleague Jenny, who was unable to make it tonight due to an emergency. So we are here for the designation application of 555 East Eighth Avenue. The application is running concurrently with a rezoning application that you will hear after this presentation, and the designation is considered a community benefit to the rezoning application. As you know, the designation process for landmark designation is a community driven. Home and applications can be submitted by a variety of persons. For this property owner submitted the designation application. The owner and applicant is Kara Christiansen. Karen Christiansen The property is in the Capitol Hill neighborhood in Council District three, a ten, I think, Councilman Hines district. It is zoned as a PWD 34, which also includes the Porter Coors Mansion, which is across eighth Avenue and is a Denver landmark and an empty parking lot to the Southeast. This current pod allows for office space in the buildings and new construction on the empty parking lot. Proposed rezoning is for 555 East Eighth Avenue, going from PD 34 to GM three with the use overlay. Three. The rezoning will allow for more varied uses on the site, including multi residential buildings, commercial uses, art studios, bed and breakfast, things that are allowed under use overlay three when a property is designated, but Brandon can give you more. So more details on the rezoning proposal. As you know, in order for a property to be designated, it must meet the following criteria be more than 30 years of age or of exceptional importance. As the structure was built in 1898, it is 123 years old. It meets that criteria. It needs to meet at least three out of ten significance criteria, maintain integrity and be considered by the Landmark Preservation Commission for its relation to a historic context. This application meets all of the designation criteria and it also meets three significant significance criteria that you see highlighted on the screen criteria B, C and F, which will go over now. So the property has direct and substantial association with two prominent families. First, with multiple generations of the heart family. And second, in the court family, both of whom are recognized persons who had influence on Denver and Colorado society. These earliest residents lived in the house from its construction in 1898 until 1915. The Hart family built the home and three generations resided there from 1898 to 1909. Charles and Elizabeth Hart and their son Richard, along with his family, Elizabeth and their children, John and Stefan. Together, they influenced society through professional fields of medicine and law, as well as philanthropic contributions. The most well-known Hart family member was Steven Hart, who was born while the family lived at the house. Steven would go on to co-found one of Colorado's largest and most influential law firms, Holland and Hart, and he served in the state legislature . He also became Colorado's first state historic preservation office and his dedication to historic preservation. He was honored by the naming of the Steven H. Hart Research Center at History, Colorado, and the Steven H. Hart Awards, which are typically actually given tonight but were postponed due to Comic-Con and which are given to honor historic preservation accomplishments throughout the state. I'm on the court. Purchased the property from the Harts in 1909 and lived there with this with her husband, Peter McCourt, until her death in 1920 1912. Peter continued to live there until 1915 when the property was sold and then the court was known as an excellent businesswoman and well-respected socialite who aided many impoverished individuals and families. She is also acknowledged for her leadership and entrepreneurial spirit that drove her interest and significant involvement in the management of Denver's Broadway and Tabor Grand Opera House theaters, which her second husband, Peter McCourt, was also involved in. He was the brother of the infamous Baby Doe, Taylor Tabor, and the second who was the second wife of Silver King Horace Tabor. Peter McCourt was best known as the prominent theater manager of the world famous Tabor Grand Opera House and the Broadway Theater in Denver. He became one of the most successful theater managers in the country and grew the performing arts in Denver at the turn of the 20th century. He devised the well-known and long lasting silver circuit that booked performing acts across the city cities in Denver, in Colorado, as well as the West and the Northwest. And during the time when the McCourts reside and owned in the property, Peter was expanding the circuit. Due to its association with multiple recognized persons who had influence on society. The property meets criterion be. Both the primary and the accessory structures embody the distinctive visible characteristics of the classical revival or neoclassical architectural style, which was popular in the US from 1895 through the 1950s. The primary structure was constructed in 1898, designed by Denver architects Varian and Sterner. The classical revival style is distinguished from other contemporary revival styles of the time by its use of symmetrical facades, with central entries for height porches supported by classical columns and the use of classical details such as broken pediment, dental cornices and balustrades. The primary structure exemplifies the classical revival style with its dramatic front porch, which dominates the front facade. These are supported by a period iconic columns, along with a decorative balustrade on the second level. The overhanging eaves feature dental courses and frieze bend underneath the cornice. A site edition carries many of these character defining features, including the balance, strike corners and dental courses. The 1911 Carriage House was designed by Denver firm Stirner and Williamson, Stringer's subsequent architectural firm, and also exemplifies the classical revival style and its design elements. And finally, the property is also significant as an established and familiar feature of the Capitol Hill neighborhood due to its prominent location and physical characteristics. It represents over 120 years of Capitol Hill, Capitol Hill history and evolution. Additionally, its prominent location facing onto and elevated above East Eighth Avenue, coupled with its sizable massing scale and architectural features , makes it a familiar and orienting feature of the neighborhood. It is the oldest surviving structure on the block between eighth and ninth Avenues and Pearl on Pennsylvania streets. Over time, most single unit structures and properties were replaced by tall multi-unit structures, which primarily now surround 55 East Eighth Avenue. The exception is the property directly to the north and south on East Avenue and across from the Hartford courthouse, which are also known for landmarks. In addition to meeting the three criteria, the property retains integrity. It remains in its original location. There have been some exterior alterations, but they are sensitive to the original design materials and workmanship as well as the feeling and association of the property. The west and north are rear additions in the porch and closure to the primary structure, which was made in 1929, are compatible with the building's character and do not negatively impact the building's integrity. The addition of the retaining wall and parking lot to impact the setting and feeling, but do not detract from the essential features of the primary structure and carriage house. Overall, the property retains good integrity. The period of significance for this is 1898, the year of construction to 1950. It is it involves the construction of the house, the addition of the carriage house and the years of the heart and the court families resided at the address. The property relates to the context of Denver's recovery and expansion. Following the panic of 1893. Due to the silver crash, Denver experienced an immediate economic downturn that lasted several years and never negatively impacted the city. While many of Capitol Hill's wealthy families were left penniless after the silver panic, this was not the case for the Hart family, whose financial and social status survived due to their careers in medicine and law. And and Peter McCourt, who owned the property next after the city had recovered from the economic downturn. Their six years of ownership fell during a time of continued growth through Denver's economic diversification. And so it is relates to the economic growth of Denver in the early 1900s. And the ABC found that it related to a historic context. In summary, the property meets all the criteria for designation. It's more than 30 years old, meets three designation criteria b, c, an F maintains its integrity and the LPC found that it related to historic context. Two individuals submitted emails in support of the designation and none in opposition. And so the Preservation Commission unanimously recommended approval of the designation application on December seven. Therefore, staff recommends approval for the designation of five, five, five East Eighth Avenue as a structure for preservation. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. All right. Thank you very much, Kara. And council this evening has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 21 1526. We have four individuals signed up to speak this evening, and our first speaker is M Karen Christiansen. You might have to unmute yourself. And Mr. Christiansen, you can go ahead, please. I thought you had unmuted. Go ahead. I'm going to ask you to Amu. There you go. Okay. My name is Karen Christianson. I'm a native of Denver. And I that I live at one, three, three Evergreen Road in Gilpin County. I'm the owner of 555 East Eighth Avenue. I'm also 76 years old, and I love this building. It's a beautiful building of I hope to care for for many years, and it. Certainly deserves. A landmark designation. I request the Council vote for approval bill. 20 1-1526 for landmark designation for 555 East Eighth Avenue. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Bruce O'Donnell. Hello, Madam President, and members of the council. This is Bruce O'Donnell at 386 Emmerson Street in Denver. And Karen Christianson, who just spoke, who's the owner of Phi Phi Phi, the State Avenue. And I started on this project a couple of years ago, and I'm involved primarily in the rezoning of the property, which is, as Cara from Landmark's put it, is kind of a companion piece of legislation. And it's necessary that the rezoning and the landmark designation be considered in unison. And so I'm requesting that City Council vote to approve the landmark designation for Phi Phi Phi V State Avenue this evening. And I'm available to answer questions. Should you have any? Thank you. Thank you, Bruce. Our next speaker is Annie Levinsky. Good evening, members of City Council. I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of Historic Denver, located at 1420 Ogden Street in Denver. And we're here to offer our support for this designation. And I particularly want to start with our expression of gratitude to Mr. Christiansen for taking this on. We met with her first a couple of years ago when she was just thinking about this and wanting to make sure that the house had or that the structure had expanded uses continue to serve the community. And she's gone on to work with Mr. O'Donnell and others to prepare the application. So we really appreciate those efforts. Obviously, the home has significant ties to people in Colorado history and great architecture. And Karen went through all of those details. So I'll just add the other comment around how this is a great example of how our structures can be adapted to meet contemporary current community needs. So we see this home now positioned to be a multifamily dwelling complex and have the flexibility to change again over time. So we just are really pleased to see that happening and appreciate your support for this designation as well as the rezoning. Thank you. Thank you, Annie. And I have to say, I think you're the first speaker that we've had tilted in our Zoom platform, so congratulations. You're the first one that way. Our final speaker on this hearing is Jesse Paris this evening. Go ahead, please, Jesse. Counsel. May I be heard? Yes, go ahead. The pairs represent for Blackstone Maximo for self-defense as the Mexican man for social change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and for a long black nose along with the East Denver Residence Council. And I'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023. I'm in favor of this preservation tonight. For all the reasons that have already been discussed, it meets all the criteria. It's a historical site. It needs to be preserved. And I support preservation of many of Denver Oracle sites. So I support this one as well. I'm very thrilled and happy to hear that this might be a more time family dwelling. Let's hope that it's an affordable reasonably. We do have a housing crisis. So I'm in full support of this. My thank you. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 21, Dash 1526. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 21, Dash 1526 Council Member Hines Thank you. Council President I am really excited to see this be up for consideration as a historic for historic designation. I've been I've gone by this, this home lots of times in my trips down to Trader Joe's and and some of the restaurants, the banana restaurants that have also been considered for historic work. Some people have suggested they should be considered for historic preservation. This this is a this is a gem. It's a really it's it's such a beautiful place. And I just want to mention one other thing. So I would encourage my colleagues support of the historic designation. And we'll talk about the rezoning here in a second. But but there are letters of support from neighboring neighboring establishments. There are letters of support from registered neighborhood organizations. And in fact, the neighborhood organizations were strongly encouraging this historic designation just because it's such a gem. So I want to thank the applicant for being willing to to consider historic designation and and for also specifically for moving these two public hearings together, because I think that really helped the surrounding community feel at ease that that it would be designated as well as as have the rezoning. So I encourage support from my colleagues, support from my colleagues. And I will certainly be voting. Yes. Thank you. Council President. Thank you, Councilmember Hines, and I am happy to support this tonight. I think Kara and team did a great job. No opposition to something of this matter.

It was something that the School of Nursing was doing that a friend of mine was putting these kids together that were tasks that the children, they were seeing how parents. Or caregivers would interact. With the kids. And unfortunately, I was the labor and never really got to see what was happening. But it was fascinating to hear that they were using these kits with different tests of various difficulty to see how parents or caregivers interacted and explained how to do the task.

And we're going to first hear items 24 and 12 and 20. I've had requests hold on, 24, 12 and 14, and then we'll do the rest of the of the item. Okay. First up, item 24. Communication from Mayor Garcia Recommendation to approve Mayor's designees as argument writers for the two Long Beach ballot measures appearing on the November 8th, 2016 California statewide election ballot. Think you just want to go over the process on this similar to how we did it for Measure A, the clerk put out a call for argument writers that was published published in a couple of the publications as well as press release and in her media and social media. So that went out for the two city items, all for the regulation of medical marijuana business item. There were six folks signed up for one that signed up against for the Long Beach marijuana taxation measure. There were three that signed up for two that signed up against. I put all the names signed up on there with the exception of one person that was the additional person on six for the four of of medical marijuana businesses can only have a total of five. And so the one person that was not placed there was double place on the against line anyways for the second measure. So they got a chance to do the other one. So let me read those names in case you don't have it in front of you. Regulation of medical marijuana businesses. Six people applied Bob Kelton, D Andrews, Janine Pearce, Toni Tauranga and Randy Houser. Five mispronounced that name. The six person that applied was Diana La Jean's. So the the first five were the ones that were selected and Bob Kelton is selected as the lead in that group. The guests with Mark Greenberg on that only one person applied on the Long Beach marijuana taxation measure. Three people applied. Robert Garcia, myself, Mike Terry, who's the fire chief, and Robert Luna, who the police chief two people signed up against, which is Larry King and Diana La Jean's. Larry King will be the lead proponent on that and I will be the lead proponent on the fourth side. In addition, as a reminder, if a name of a name is a has an asterisk on your form, it means are the lead proponent. They have final say in approving argument and lead writers may add more names provided there are open slots, but that's less than five on an argument. So if, for example, Mr. Greenberg, since he was the only one, if he would like to find other people to add to his list, he's welcome to do so and so on. And this follows the charter process that the the city attorney and the city clerk worked on for this process like they did for measure. Right? So with that, there is a a motion and a second. Councilman Austin, do you have any comments? Councilwoman Gonzales, do you have any comments? I'm sorry. Is that a yes or no? Okay. Councilwoman Price. I do have some comments, and it would be much easier just to not say anything. But you all know me well enough to know that I won't do that. I'm a little bit disappointed, honestly, in saying that two of my colleagues have signed on to support this initiative. And although we all have the right and the freedom to express our our opinions and our interests, and we have the right to free speech as representatives of the city of Long Beach, with a fiduciary duty to care for the residents of this city, I would ask them to reconsider signing on to this for for a variety of reasons. One, the legislation that's proposed limits the police's ability to investigate potential crime. It's specifically within the draft ordinance, limits our police's ability to investigate in any manner that they would do with any other business. It creates a citizen task force to opine on the validity of a citation, thereby conflicting with our charter in regards to the powers and the duties that are reserved for the City Council. It prohibits the assessment of regulatory fees for cost recovery by the city. Again, violating our charter, the city charter that we are all bound to follow as representatives of the citizens of the city of Long Beach. It repeals the taxes that our voters voted in 2014 regarding medical marijuana. Litigation is expected based on the memorandum that was provided by the city manager's office and staff. It requires a $5.1 million ongoing cost. And the revenue, which is projected to be at the middle term of $7.1 million, is expected to be faced with a cost to the city of $12.2 million annually. That's a $5 million shortfall, not counting the first year's one time startup fees. As representatives of the citizens of the city of Long Beach, with the fiduciary duty to vote in the best interest of the residents. I cannot fathom supporting an initiative that directly conflicts with our city. Charter requires us to undertake a $5 million shortfall and is very likely going to land us in litigation shortly after it is enacted if it isn't enacted. I ask you if you are going to sign on as a proponent of this initiative, do you intend to recuse yourself from the vote regarding litigation? Because that vote will come. And as proponents of this initiative, do you really stand in an objective place? So with that, I thank you, Mr. Mayor, for giving me the opportunity to speak. Thank you. And for clarification, there's two measures in front of us. I think the council was referring to the first measure, which is regulation of medical marijuana businesses. And Councilwoman, there was another person that came up. Nope. Did that get removed? Councilman Austin. Yes. I just want to thank Councilmember Price for making those points and certainly made some great arguments against the measure. I'm sure surely you'll be working with Mr. Greenberg. I just want to clarify that I have signed on. I made a motion to approve this, and it has nothing to do with. It only has to do with approving the ballot, argued those who are arguing for and against the initiative. I respond to that only because my name was mentioned. No, Mr. Watson, I don't intend to get involved in any side of this debate because I would like to stay in a place of objectivity when we are going to be voting on potential litigation in this case. And I do not believe that it's appropriate for a council member to sign on on an initiative that is going to have a detrimental impact for the city one way or the other. So that's my personal belief. I got you. But I was. Playing piano a compliment. That but I didn't want the the people who might be watching to walk away thinking that I'm going to be working with somebody behind the scenes. Because if I were going to do that, I would sign on to it. But again, ethically, I don't believe I believe that's a violation of our fiduciary duty. Okay. Thank you. And just before we go to a vote, I'm going to open up for public comment. Of course, this process is the the process that is laid out in our charter as far as ballot designees. So the call for names, the names being submitted, the names going to the council and putting the names on for the signatures of the ballot. And so that's what we have in front of us. And I do have a comment. If anyone has any public comment on this, see? None. Okay. Thank you. With that, then please cast your vote. And as a reminder, ballot statements are do that. Madam Quirk, I think it's the 19th for these folks. That's correct. Okay. So for the folks listed below, it's the 19th. All the ballot arguments have to be submitted. Motion carries.","Recommendation to approve Mayor's designees as argument writers for the two Long Beach ballot measures appearing on the November 8, 2016 California Statewide Election ballot.","Item Type: Recommendation

Item 34, a report from Health and Human Services recommendation to receive and file a report on recent updates to state and local COVID 19 health orders, including but not limited to masking and vaccine requirements citywide America. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, and members of the city council. So we have a presentation for you tonight to really dove a little deeper into what's been going on with COVID. Kind of remind us all of a lot of the action that the City of Long Beach has taken and a lot of the leadership that we've exhibited regarding vaccines, regarding distribution, regarding masking and a number of safety protocols. So we'll be going through that tonight. And also, this is a receiving file item. So it's really just more about information and giving you a sense and letting you hear from the doctor, too, about kind of the things that we look at during the pandemic right now and what might be in our future. We're also going to be listening and taking, you know, the ability to ask questions and answer those. So I will turn it now over to Kelly Collopy and Dr. Davis to go through the presentation. Good evening, honorable mayor and council members. Dr. Davis and I are thank the I thank you for this opportunity to provide an update on COVID 19 data and vaccinations as well as to share about movement across the country to implement vaccine mandates for patrons of specific business sectors. First, I'd like to share the many ways we've led as a jurisdiction and the ability to ensure vaccine availability across the sectors, as well as taking steps as a city regarding vaccine and testing mandates for our public sector employees. We were one of the first health jurisdictions to begin vaccinating first responders. We were the first health jurisdiction to expand eligibility and begin vaccinating food workers, educators, those over the age of 65 and those with underlying medical conditions. We had one of the largest mass vaccination sites in the state, serving up to 6000 people in a day. We were one of the first health jurisdictions to offer mobile and in-home testing and vaccination and one of the first municipalities to move toward vaccine verification and testing mandate for our city employees. One of our first school districts, community colleges and universities in the state to require employees to get vaccinated and test regularly. We're one of the first health jurisdictions to implement the indoor masking requirement and masking at outdoor mega events. We really have taken a strong stand to ensure the health and safety of our community members and employees around the COVID virus. First, we'd like to share a little bit of data. So this chart shows the average daily cases in light blue hospitalizations and dark blue and deaths in yellow. As you can say, all red me all remain below the winter surge for approximately the same as our first surge last summer. Average daily counts during the week of middle of August rose 164 cases per day. Just over six new hospitalizations. Hospitalizations each day, which is about 44 in a week and .14 deaths, which is approximately one death per week due to COVID in most. In more recent days, we are seeing an increase in the number of deaths. We we reported three today. Cases have been rising since mid-June, and 93% of those sequenced cases are the Delta variant. Our current case rate is 24.1 per 100,000 and positivity rate is 7.1%. Both are consistent with our February surge. This chart shows the case rates by age and you'll notice the much higher cases in yellow, which are the ages of 18 to 49 years of age. The ages 18 to 39 are among our lowest vaccine rates, at only 58%, receiving at least one dose. The L.A. County case rate is higher than in Long Beach, but the positivity rate is lower. We continue to see differences in impact of COVID by race and ethnicity. These are age adjusted rates that allow for a fair comparison between groups with different age distributions. It provides rates that would have been if the population had the same age distribution as the standard population. When utilizing age adjusted numbers, we find that our Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are approximately four times more likely than our white population to be infected by the COVID virus, nine times more likely to be hospitalized, and seven times more likely to die from COVID than our white population. For our Latino population, it's two and a half times more likely to contract the virus, 3.6 times more likely to be hospitalized at three and a half times more likely to die of COVID compared to our white population. And you'll see that our black and African-American population is more than twice as likely to be hospitalized or to die from COVID 19. The good news is we're seeing an upswing in vaccinations since July 15th. We're now averaging 622 residents per day for first doses. That's a 72% increase since mid-July. Currently, three quarters that 76% of our adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine and 65% are fully vaccinated. All of those eligible for VA. Of all of those eligible for vaccines, 73% have received at least one dose and 63% are fully vaccinated. That means nearly two thirds of all of those eligible for vaccine have been fully vaccinated. We are making progress. We know we have more work to do. I'll now turn it over to Dr. Davis to discuss vaccines and public health orders. The evening. Honorable Mayor and council members. This slide illustrates vaccination rate by age on the left and race ethnicity on the right. So on the left, it shows that the most highly vaccinated age group is those that are over the age of 65. That's that. Top line with 92.55% of those over 65 fully vaccinated. It drops progressively from there, with 74% fully vaccinated among those 50 to 64 years of age, 64% among those from 35 to 49 years of age. 51% fully vaccinated among those 25 to 34. 44% among those 18 to 24. And 12% for those 0 to 17, which includes a large proportion of individuals who are ineligible for the vaccine currently. On the right is the graph of percent vaccination by race ethnicity, which shows that many ethnicities are clustered around the 55 to 60% mark of fully vaccinated, with native Hawaiian Pacific Islanders having the highest percentage of their population fully vaccinated at 61%, followed by whites at 59%, then Asians at 57%, and American Indian Alaskan natives at 56%. Then there's a significant gap in percentage of fully vaccinated individuals, with 37% of Hispanic Latinos fully vaccinated and 35% of blacks African-Americans fully vaccinated. So this slide shows post-vaccination infections or what is commonly called breakthrough infections and gives some information about variants. The good news is that it's pretty uncommon for someone who's fully vaccinated to be infected with COVID 19. 0.34% of the 249,268 Long Beach residents who have been fully vaccinated have become infected with COVID 19 and only 0.14% of fully vaccinated people have been hospitalized due to COVID 19 and 0.00. 8% of fully vaccinated people have died due to COVID 19. The graph on the right shows the different variants that have been detected in Long Beach. There have been several different types of variants detected in Long Beach, but starting in late June, the vast majority of samples sequenced from Long Beach residents have shown the Delta variant. And as Kelly mentioned, 93% of the cases that had data was due to the Delta variant. The slide reviews vaccine effectiveness. So all three vaccines, the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe disease. They're all greater than 80% effective at preventing infection. The CDC is looking at the possibility of winning immunity several months after vaccination. They've all been shown to be greater than 90% effective at preventing hospitalization and death. So this slide illustrates how much more contagious the Delta variant is. Someone infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that started this pandemic would be estimated to infect about two other people. That's over on the left. The Alpha variant or what was known as the U.K. variant, was 50% more transmissible. And so one person could now infect 4 to 5 others. And now the Delta variant is twice as contagious as other variants, and one person infected with the Delta variant can infect up to 5 to 8 other people. So the Delta variant is definitely more formidable than the original Wildtype virus. It spreads more than twice as easily than previous variants. New data is also showing that people infected with the Delta variant have higher viral loads than previous variants. So there's more virus living in their nose and mouth that can then be transferred to other people. I'm fully vaccinated. People infected with the Delta variant may also be infectious, be able to transmit the virus to others. So a high vaccination coverage will reduce the spread of the virus and help prevent new variants from emerging. As overall cases increase and the proportion of the population vaccinated increases, we can expect to see more breakthrough cases. But the bottom line is that the COVID 19 vaccines continue to be effective. Most breakthrough infections are mild, and the COVID 19 vaccines prevent severe illness, hospitalizations and deaths from Delta. So the vaccines are working as we would expect them to. Just more graphs about how the vaccine protects you from getting infected and being hospitalized or dying from COVID. So on the left, this is Long Beach data and the solid blue lines show the case rate among unvaccinated in the. The case among those who are vaccinated in the dark blue and then those who are unvaccinated in the solid light blue line. And you can see that the case rate is much higher in those who are unvaccinated. And then the dotted lines down there towards the bottom. So hospitalization rates among vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. And again, the rate of hospitalization is significantly higher among unvaccinated individuals. With the red dotted line down in those who are vaccinated with the yellow dotted line. And then the graph on the right is national data, and it's showing that if you're fully vaccinated, you are eight times less likely to become infected with COVID and you're 25 times less likely to be hospitalized or to die of COVID. So to summarize the data, all of the vaccines work to produce to reduce infections, hospitalizations and death, even against the the delta variant. The biggest reduction is in hospitalizations and deaths. We are seeing cases and fully vaccinated people and this is because there are a lot of fully vaccinated people out there. But when you look at everyone who's fully vaccinated, the chances of becoming infected with COVID are quite low 0.35% of all those who are fully vaccinated. There's also a lot of virus out there, and the vaccine is not 100% effective at preventing infections. So for all of those reasons, that's why we can expect to continue to see cases in fully vaccinated. Now just to review the vaccine related health orders that have come out recently. So July 26, the California Department of Public Health released a state public health order. Which required that in a set of high risk facilities, that all facilities must verify the vaccination status of their workers and they must test unvaccinated workers regularly. And all workers must wear surgical masks. So this order applied to acute care hospitals or medical surgical hospitals, long term care facilities, including our skilled nursing facilities, and then a whole list of other health care settings including but not limited to doctor's offices, acute psychiatric hospitals and substance use treatment centers, and then also to high risk congregate settings such as homeless shelters, adult and senior day health facilities and correctional and detention. And then subsequently on August 5th, another state public health order was released and this one required all health care workers to receive their first dose of a one dose regimen or their second dose of a two dose regimen of a COVID 19 vaccine by September 30th. And this requirement in religious and medical exemptions were allowed. If a worker received a medical or religious exemption, then they must test regularly. And the list there is who this what type of facilities this order applied to. And then on top of that, another order came out also on August 5th, which required visitors to verify their vaccination status or show proof of a negative COVID 19 test in order to visit an acute care hospitals or long term care facilities and skilled nursing facility. And then with regards to school settings, on August 9th, Obie USD announced that they would require vaccination verification of all school workers and regular regular screening testing of all unvaccinated workers. This was followed on August 11th by a state public health order, which required that all public and private schools must verify the vaccination status of all their workers and that all unvaccinated workers would have to undergo regular screening. Testing. In the state also updated some of their guidance and requirements around mega events. And they updated the definition of an indoor mega event or large event from 5000 participants to 1000 participants. So participants of indoor events of greater than 1000 individuals will be required to provide proof of vaccination or a negative COVID 19 test prior to entering. So a summary of the orders as they relate to the city of Long Beach. Acute care hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities are required to verify vaccination status of their workers and visitors, test all unvaccinated visitors and require vaccination of workers and test exempted workers. Other health care settings such as doctor's offices, psychiatric hospitals, dialysis centers, etc. are required to verify vaccination status of their workers and to require vaccination of workers and to regularly test exempt workers. Other high risk congregate settings, homeless shelters, etc. are required to verify vaccination status of its workers and regularly test all unvaccinated workers. And public and private schools are required to verify vaccination status of its workers and regularly test all unvaccinated workers. In addition to the state orders, Long Beach has added that masking is required in all public indoor spaces. It's required masking outdoors for large scale events of more than 10,000. Participants and we've added Dennis and home health care agencies to the vaccine mandate. So given all of the state health orders, there's been a lot of movement in more local health orders and expanding some of the different verification and mandate systems to other to other businesses. So a number of jurisdictions have moved forward with vaccine and testing requirement for their employees. So the state, L.A. County and our city have implemented vaccine verification or testing for unvaccinated employees. Ours was announced on July 27. L.A. City and San Francisco are requiring all employees to be vaccinated with only medical and religious exemptions. San Francisco tied theirs to full FDA approval, which happened on Monday. So in ten weeks from now, all employees must be vaccinated. A number of cities have also implemented vaccine mandates for specific high risk indoor settings. All are including indoor food service areas, including bars, restaurants and other indoor food service establishments because mass must be removed in the space to eat and drink. Other cities are also including indoor gyms and fitness centers, giving patrons have elevated breathing and often heavy exertion, which can increase the transmission. New York is one of the more expansive with mandates, including a wide variety of indoor entertainment and recreation facilities. And you'll see the list there on the slide. More locally, Palm Springs passed a mandate for vaccines or testing for indoor spaces of restaurants and bars, as well as large scale ticketed events. The City of Los Angeles has directed their city attorney to establish an ordinance that goes further than all the other mandates I've seen, as it includes retail establishments in the mandate. This ordinance is still being written and we're watching to see how they define retail establishments. The L.A. County Board of Supervisors asked the Los Angeles County Public Health Department to develop a report with considerations and recommendations for possible vaccine mandates that port roads deliver today and will be discussed at next week's Board of Supervisors meeting. Their considerations include high risk indoor settings where masks are removed, such as restaurants and bars, as well as entertainment establishments where food is served indoors. They're also considering fitness facilities giving high levels of exertion and often ill fitting masks. The Health and Human Services Department has been tracking on all of these developments and reviewing and utilizing a number of different considerations. The first focus is on the science of the vaccine and transmissibility of the virus. What businesses would have the highest risk settings for people who are unvaccinated, particularly young people under age 12 who aren't currently eligible for vaccine? We also look at the level of transmissibility in the community, and right now that transmissibility is high. We also consider the risk to those who may be vaccinated but have compromised immune systems and are more susceptible to transmission. We look at the risk level of the facilities. We know that masks reduce transmission. But when we must when people must remove the mask to participate in the business, the protections are gone. These include indoor restaurants and bars. It could also include entertainment businesses who serve food as an ancillary service, such as a movie theater or a family fun zone. We also consider levels of exertion and the capacity to effectively wear a mask in most spaces. Fitness centers would be considered their. Other considerations to take to take into consideration are that support wellness but focus on equity and access to services for people. We wonder, you know, we look at whether the business is essential to daily living, such as a grocery store, a bank, hair salon, clothing store, etc., or a mask can be worn during the whole visit. We also look at equity considerations. We still have many who do not trust the vaccine nor the government. We continue to work closely with these communities and we are seeing progress. But moving forward with mandates, absent other options for people, it is an equity concern for access to essential services. Small minority owned businesses would also likely struggle first to be able to implement the mandate, and second, because many of their patrons may choose not to come to the business. If a vaccine is mandated. We're also looking at impacts on businesses. They'll need digital QR code readers to be able to look at the to be able to read the digital vaccine records and a person to check at the door. These have financial impacts. You'll also need the ability to mediate situations if someone is angry because they can't come in. The city's ability to enforce the mandate is also a consideration. We have hundreds of bars, restaurants, fitness and entertainment businesses and enforcement takes time and resources. And finally, we would support a regional or statewide approach. We think this is really important for consistency, to support understanding among our businesses, community members and for enforcement. We are actively reviewing data trends and mandates from other jurisdictions. Our goal is to work to address the high risk indoor situations, to provide the greatest level of safety for the patrons of those businesses, as well as employees of those businesses who interact with patrons while also taking into consideration the equity issues. Some jurisdictions are mandating vaccinations to push people toward getting vaccine, so they're incorporating a broader spectrum of businesses. We are working on an approach that focuses primarily on safety and addressing risk. We anticipate the possibility of an upcoming health order based on all of these considerations and what we are seeing in transmissibility and vaccine uptake. That concludes our presentation and we're open for questions. Thank you. I really appreciate the health department. I want to again, just think about the copy and copy, Dr. Davis, for not just the report, but just the incredible work since the pandemic started and even before. We have a great team at the Long Beach Health Department. We're very, very grateful for for this work. I have a couple comments and then I want to do have a question or two. And then any of the council also has any comments. We'll we'll we'll go there as well. But I want to and if I do that, Madam Court, can you reload the screen? I think the. The queue system is not up yet. There it is. Thank you very much. Let me just say a few a few just general comments. I want to just first note, and I think it's important to note when we have these discussions that there's there's there's real lives and people behind everyone that has passed. As of today, we have lost almost 970. I think we're at 969 individuals from our community that have died due to the pandemic. These are moms and dads and kids and sisters and brothers and grandparents. And it is and remains the largest loss of life that we've ever had. I mean, this amount of time in the history of our city and in an emergency this large, it's always important to center our conversations around those that are impacted the most. And I know I for the 969 families and the countless more that that are living with with deep health conditions or other types of trauma, please know that you are in our thoughts every single day and that we work and we and we struggle with these with these with these issues because we want to save every life possible. And it's important that the most important things that we can do. As it relates to the pandemic, is to try to save as many lives as possible and keep people as safe as possible. I also want to just say that the the 76% eligible adults number that we have that we hit, I think today, actually. Is incredibly impressive. And in light of of the horrors of the of the pandemic and still the work that is ahead of us, I just do want to thank our vaccination team for. For reaching that metric. And even when you look at the 12 plus population, that's almost it's on its way to 74%. I think maybe it's maybe in the mid 70 threes. But that is also an impressive number. When you look at just when you look at the 12 plus number and when you look at the 18 plus number, which is kind of which is the what the state uses as their as their state metric. It is very, very impressive. And I'm more optimistic than ever that we are going to hit 80%, you know, in the weeks ahead. I think that was a number that many of us hoped that we could hit at some point. It's still going to be difficult, but we are we are on our way there. And on the vaccination front, this work would not be possible, wasn't just the city's work, but we have countless community organizations, countless hospitals and clinics, community organizers, nonprofits that are knocking on doors, that are setting up pop up tents and parks, that are going to churches to get the vaccination vaccinations done. And I just want to thank every single one of those groups and volunteers, staff members that are out on weekends and nights trying to educate and vaccinate as much as possible. A lot of the the information that was presented tonight and a lot of the movement statewide has also been because of Long Beach. And I want to highlight that Long Beach has consistently been a leader on on on vaccines, whether it was being the first restrictions to start vaccinating our teachers and educators or the first to begin the grocery workers. I think about our. Dr. Davis, when when you gave the go ahead to start vaccinating people with disabilities that we were doing that before most of the entire state was. And so I think that that has also helped us have a a process that was accessible and continues to be accessible within neighborhoods. Imperfect, but still but still accessible. And I want to also note that when we when Long Beach Unified became the first the first and largest jurisdiction in the state to put in the vaccination mandate or the weekly test that prompted the very next day the state to do the same thing. And I'm really proud of Long Beach for moving forward and taking a hard step, but an important one with their mandate. Long Beach is and became the the only and largest jurisdiction in the state of California where every public agency had put a vaccine mandate in place. The city. The school district, the community college, the state university. And if you want to add our partner agencies like the county, you have a essentially all public employees within this city are under the vaccine mandate requirements that we have. And I'm very grateful and thankful to the health team for for doing that. I also just want to know that as we move forward, the one thing we also we have to keep in mind and this is really important and at least I believe strongly not everybody does, but the public good always trumps personal liberty. And the greater public good and public health have to be considered first and foremost greater than a person's individual belief about their own personal liberty. In that moment. I know that's a difficult conversation, but it's one that I believe strongly that the greater public good must always guide our work. And I strongly believe, Dr. Davis, that that that you have always kept in mind as greater public good public health question as you and the team have made decisions about, um, about our future. I'll also add that and I think you noted this at the end it but I think it's important to note. That right now there is an active conversation across L.A. County and the city of Long Beach about additional vaccine requirements for for businesses, as well as kind of a vaccine check or a mandate that would happen for folks attending certain types of businesses has been reported widely, of course, in the media. But I want to just make sure that at actually this call, if you if you can just respond. And I know that the city of Long Beach currently is having active conversations with L.A. County and are monitoring the discussions around additional vaccination requirements for certain types of businesses. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. And I know that the that it could be over the course of the next week or so. It looks like a lot of those conversations around what could possibly be additional restrictions would likely come forward from the L.A. County health officer or perhaps their own health department. Is that something you're expecting as well? Yes, L.A. County will be discussing next Tuesday and we'll know the forward motion there. We'll be paying attention to that. And and as far as our own internally, we are as a as a city and as a health team, having active conversations about everything you mentioned as it relates to impacts to businesses, a safety for employees, equity considerations and how, you know, technology would be integrated into a decision of that magnitude. Is that correct? Yes, that's correct. Okay. Well, I just want to just share and I think I've mentioned this, you know, privately, I always do. But I will. I always have and I always will continue to support the decisions made by the doctors and scientists of the Long Beach Health Department that continued, in my opinion, to do everything they can to ensure that we remain safe and that people remain safe in the community. So I look forward to your additional recommendations and and your and continuing to keep the the Council and myself informed as to the best public public science and health and how we ensure that we protect as many people as possible during what is still a serious health crisis and pandemic. And so, again, people, please, if you are if you're not, you've been vaccinated, please get vaccinated. It's the best way to keep people safe. And please know that our I continue to talk to nurses and doctors every single day in our hospitals who are pleading with us to continue to do the right thing and to not strain the hospital like where we were, of course, in the spike during the wintertime. So with that, I have a this is a receiving file. There's no action that needs to be taken. Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. So first, thank you, Ms.. Collopy and Dr. Davis, for your presentation. Something that stood out to me was the slide that showed how well we're doing with vaccinations and how the vaccinations are impacting what we're seeing play out with this surge, point 34% of those vaccinated have been infected. I think that's important to note. That point three, for only 0.3, 4% of people who have been vaccinated have been infected and have had a breakthrough case. That's a really small number. And .014 of people who are vaccinated have been hospitalized. There's less than 2% in .000 8%. Of people who have been vaccinated have died. I think first I want to offer my thanks to our health department for leading such a valiant effort on the vaccinations. And and I think we need to underscore the point that the vaccinations work. They're working, the data showing that they're working. That said, there's a bit further to go. The rates within that we've seen on some of these slides within communities that are not vaccinated, it's alarming. And if you just, you know, take that and apply it to who the people are that we see in the hospitals or the people who are getting the the breakthrough cases, the hospitalizations, the deaths, they're skewed toward communities that have not been vaccinated. And so we need to do all that we can to make sure that these communities we do all that we can to make sure that these vaccinations are happening, particularly now that vaccinations are beginning to get, you know , full approval from FDA. I also think I'm particularly concerned about children because children aren't able to be vaccinated. So quick question with the school vaccination mandate. Now, my understanding is that that applies to both public and private schools. Could you speak to how well the schools are transitioning, getting ready to implement this mandate, both public and private, going into back to school? Yes. Thank you. So the order came out, I guess, about two weeks ago now. Maybe ten days or so. So I think there's a lot of planning that's that's happening right now. We had a conversation with all of the schools this week. We had a did a discussion about what the new guidance is and offered our resources. And so I think that the schools are very well informed of what the mandate is and how to verify the vaccination status. And. And so I think just putting their plans together for the upcoming school year, which from what I could gather, it's kind of the next week or so, is when most of the schools will be returning. I think we we I'm particularly concerned about back to school. We've seen during vacation season or back to school, we always get a bump in numbers. And so we can anticipate that we know enough to know that. And so I would love to know how well and what we can do to make sure that we're supporting the schools, both public and private, as they get into back to school. And I think we should also expand that to anywhere that we think is child centered, should have a mix, have a vaccination mandate vaccination or a testing mandate because the children can be vaccinated yet and very vulnerable population that we really need to focus on. And then in terms of additional measures, I know that, you know, I'm paying attention to discussions. I know there's discussion about additional measures. My philosophy on this is a rather take a pill to offset a heart attack. And to me, wearing masks, getting the vaccination, that's taken a pill to offset a massive cardiac arrest. And so if it keeps our economy from shutting down again, if it keeps us from being overwhelmed in our hospitals, then we should we should look at, you know, high traffic areas, you know, sensitive areas. We need to make sure that we're I would be supportive of a mandate in those areas. Now, I also would be concerned about equity concerns, particularly around grocery stores and things like that. What I don't want is to not think about what the impact could be to food insecurity or if someone has another health emergency and they haven't gotten the vaccination. I don't want to discourage them to not go get an STD check or to go do whatever else needs to happen. So we really need to think about those equity considerations. But that said, I think you should explore additional vaccination mandates. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Allen. Thank you, Mayor, and. Thank you. Kelly. And thank you, Dr. Davis, for always proactively responding to recent. Events and taking actions that are necessary and protecting. Our community. I tell you, we are just so fortunate that we have you as our city health officer. You have kept our community safe, and I'm proud of all of your work. I'm also proud of the mayor. I know he's. Been very active and just our fearless leader. And making sure that people. Get shots in those arms. The Delta variant. Is is pretty scary to me and and it's aggressive and we have to take meaningful steps to stop the spread. My dad, who lives in Florida and my uncle who lives in Washington State, were fully vaccinated and have both contracted COVID. And they are they're really sick. I'm confident that they're going to pull through. But I'm concerned about breakthrough. I mean, I see this number. .34, but I just. I just wonder. Like where this is going. I know they got their vaccinations early and in January and so is our elderly community. You know, are are they at risk? And so I just frankly, I absolutely want to see more stringent mask mandates. We absolutely need to bounce back and thrive as a city. And I think we have to do everything possible to make sure that that's happening. I am encouraged by the private industry. I know that they're stepping up and demanding. Vaccinations, and. I think these mandates work. It encourages people to get shots. If you want to go to a plane, if you want to go to a football game, you know, you have to show that you've been vaccinated. One of the questions I have for both of you is, you know, how are we going to use technology to our advantage? I'm a big Raider fan, most of you know that. But I've already been to several Raider games and and I'm required to use an application called Clear. And it scans your driver's license and it scans your card and it does a facial recognition. And it makes sure that you're the person and it gives you a clearance for so many days before you go to this. Event and. To ensure that you're that you're fully vaccinated. It was really easy to use. And so I wonder what we're going to be doing. And what technology that we're going to be. Using as we have big events like the Grand Prix that. Are coming into town. I just want to let you know that I will continue to be outspoken about the need to get vaccinated. And and protect. Our families. So thank you for what you do. I know how much the community health means to you and means to me as well. And I thank you for this report. Councilwoman Sara. Thank you, Mayor. I want to add to add to what you shared. You know, thank you, Ms.. Cowpea and Dr. Davis, for the presentation. And to many of the neighborhood leaders, to many of the organizations that have continue and does do the work of outreaching and educating to our community members how to access the vaccine and and , you know, concerns around it. You know, my my and I know that the work continues on. You know, I live in the 90 813 area code, which has the lowest rate of vaccination, lowest rate of vaccination rate, which is at about 65.2% of the population and compared to the 76% of the adult population. And so certainly this is a equity concern for me. I just you know, I know that, you know, I know there's a lot done because I get a flier on, you know, am I am I gate where to access the vaccine. But I'm wondering I know that there are a lot of. Ways are approaching and making sure that we reach out to people in this area code. But I'm just wondering, what else do we need to do? What else can we do before we have to move towards mandating because of the various concerns that people have? Because I am also concerned about our vulnerable population. Those who are, you know, have their immune system isn't as strong. Two children under 12 that hasn't been vaccinated. And our elderly who may need a booster but haven't gotten it yet, that are also vulnerable. So I am wondering what else can we do to reach out to those in particularly not just in this area code and others that are still not moving towards the vaccine, getting vaccinated? We we you know, we continue to outreach and engage with everybody locally. What we're really finding is that it's a relationship, relationship and more relationship. And if you know someone or it went well, you know, those kinds of things. That's really helping. I think that the impact of the for a full approval on on Monday does raise some concerns and we'll be tracking to see if we start to see increases in first dose after that as well. I think that, you know, we are hearing that they're, you know, different agents respond to different things differently. And it is community and others. And so we are really working to to sort of tailor messaging, tailor engagements, tailor opportunity to be able to speak to that. So that's really what we're doing, you know, we're doing right now and we are seeing improvement. So, you know, it's it's it's slow growing for sure. It's slow going all across the nation, L.A. County, across the state. But but we are seeing improvements. And and so we'll just keep our eye and we'll keep on doing that. Yeah. And I do hope that we also continue to work with our nonprofit organization helping with outreach and engagement, as well as our faith based community leaders to get their feedback about, you know, what's really working and not as we're getting further information and also at what point, you know, also feedback if we do move to vaccination and want to make sure we check in with them. If that's the case, how do we communicate that to the community members as well in language as well as through relationships? Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Munger. Thank you. Within the last three weeks, what are we seeing in terms of vaccination clinic turnout? The numbers are increasing. So we've been seeing, especially at the we're seeing greater numbers at the PCC clinics. So the Pacific Coast campus during the day and in the evenings, those numbers are increasing as well as at Cabrillo and some of our other sites. I think part of it also is, is that our many, many partners in vaccine, many of our pharmacies and providers and others. So as as we as we discussed in the slide, we are seeing about a 72% increase in daily and daily first dose vaccines going forward. So we are we are seeing we are seeing increases. In light of the recent lawsuit decision related to immunity being a component of access to universities versus vaccination. Are we working to have any partners with either the Red Cross or the UCLA antibody study or any of those so that people who have recently had COVID and might. Still carry that immunity would be able to demonstrate that immunity to us in a meaningful way. To help us provide that as a contributor to our I mean, I'm most concerned about our immunity rate more than our vaccination rate of 20% of our population had COVID. Depending on when they had it and what their immunity level is. What does that look like for us? So your question is, is what does our immunity look like in Long Beach? What are we doing to give constituents access? Like, I have a neighbor, this whole family had COVID, so in their mind they don't need a vaccination because they had COVID. So they're already immune. But there's no real. And like I was at Memorial today and they said they don't have any antibody testing available for their patients, but they UCLA has an antibody study. I don't know if Red Cross is doing antibodies on your donations, but it would be awesome to be able to say, Hey, go donate blood and you can see if you're still immune or not because you might not be. And then he and his family might all go get vaccinated. Right. Right. Okay, I got you. So the antibody testing really is a kind of frontier field. So we're just really not at the point where we can test an individual with an antibody test and be able to determine that they're immune. It's really looking at when we use antibody tests, we really look at the surveillance of an entire community because it's just not accurate enough on a 1 to 1 basis. Okay. Unfortunately, right now and then the other thing that they have seen, you know, everything is still evolving, but you can't get reinfected. Right. So it's felt that you can stay immune for about 90 days after you're infected with COVID, but then after that, you can get reinfected. They are seeing that it's you're more likely to get reinfected if you originally got infected versus you got vaccinated, like how you got your immunity. Right. So that's pointing to the importance of vaccination. So it could be that going forward, you know, they would give you a 90 day reprieve from vaccination. But since they're only giving you 90 days, really right now, the recommendation is that after you're done with your infection, you've done your isolation, that you should get vaccinated because that provides. And are we using that as a tool like, oh, you just got tested at a city facility. You're positive. It's August 1st. Please be back December 1st for your vaccination. Like, are we also doing that to individuals? We do. And we also pair the vaccination and the testing. So if you test, you know, you can actually get vaccinated, you know, if. You're negative. At the same. Site. I see. And. I appreciate all the different comments about personal liberty and different things. And I think that one of the the discussions that's that's out there is with parents and the confusion around. Long Beach Unified School District and testing versus and the different age groups and the students in high school versus not high school. And I think that if there could be some kind of. Pointing to sources like again, I talk about being in mommy groups. I was posting the Long Beach Unified School District link in the parents of Long Beach Group multiple times this weekend to try to point people to their website of places. They can find resources. They just think there's a lot of questions and people don't know where to look. And I don't know how we can help with that or what tools we can do to better partner with them. But I think that anything we can do right now, while people are really attentive to what's needed, could help us. Thank you. Councilman in the house. Thank you very much. And. Doctor, Dr. Davis and Dr. Cowley. I think that you guys have done a phenomenal job. I think that here in Long Beach, we are incredibly lucky to have you guys both leading our health department in this crazy, crazy pandemic time. As you know, the health and safety of our residents is of utmost importance to all of us here up in the diocese. And I can't stress enough how important it is for all of us to do our part in putting an end to the COVID threat. I'm glad that counts among Member Mungo as the questions about being reinfected, because that's been one of my concerns that I've had is do people get reinfected? So thank you for clearing that up. And yes, and I think that a lot of people who have had COVID really do think that they cannot get it again, that they're immune. So actually, that is a big thing, so that we can promote even more the the efforts of getting vaccinated and how important it is. Because I think that that's where it you know, we all have to do our part and get vaccinated and get tested and most importantly, wear a mask and anywhere possible. I think that those are really good recommendations, especially because we all want to come out of this already.

Madam Secretary, please put the next item on our screens. Councilmember Torres, go ahead with your comments on this 161, please. Thank you, Madam President. So early January, we passed a bill on ghost gun legislation, and along with that bill were a number of changes made to the weapons language of the code. After hearing from a constituent, I looked at a piece of concerning wording in the language changes and made and questioned the potential expansive interpretation of the language. Any item in section F. After discussion with Council, President Gilmore made the decision to make a minor change, to propose a minor amendment that we feel is pretty meaningful. It could be interpreted that any item is not used as a weapon, which is what the language should be exclusively focused on. So given its location in the code, I know when I voted in favor of the Ghost Guns Bill, I did so believing that only substantive changes were being made to pertaining to ghost guns. Revising this section to include any item goes beyond a clerical update. I initially thought about a journalist friend of mine who covered the 2020 protest who used a gas mask when the recently revised language possessing that gas mask could be criminalized because it protects him from the effect of tear gas, even if it's not used as a weapon we shouldn't allow for this potential interpretation of the code. I want to thank the City Attorney's Office for a cooperative effort to make the fix, and I hope my colleagues will vote in favor of the amendment. Thank you, counsel pro tem Torrens and happy to support this amendment this evening. We've got Councilmember CdeBaca and then Councilmember Hines. I don't have any questions. I just wanted to make sure that it was explained to the public why this was being changed. And thank the city attorney for making the change as well. Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca. Councilmember Hines. Thank you, Councilman. President. I'd also wanted to thank Councilmember Pro-Tem Torres for this, for the catch and for the correction. I spent much of the protests actually in the streets, and most of it was in District ten. A lot of my neighbors don't have air conditioning. And so when the tear gas would would come through our community, a lot of times people would just be watching television or sleeping or whatever. And and they, too, became part of the conversation, even though unwittingly so and and so I as I spent a lot of time in the protests, I saw people with all sorts of things like gas masks or items that could have been interpreted as in in the in this ordinance without the correction. As as. Offensive. I mean, an offense not just offensive, but as a as an illegal and an and an offense to our laws. And I want to make sure that that the people who become part of this conversation unwittingly, who just happened to be living in their neighborhoods, aren't or aren't caught up with this legislation. So thank you again, pro Tem Torres for for bringing this forward. I'll be. Thank you, Councilmember Hines, and seen no one else in the queue that will stay on the consent agenda. That concludes the items to be called out this evening. Any bills for introduction are ordered published. Council members remember this is a consent or block vote and you will need to vote I. Otherwise, this is your last chance to call out an item for a separate vote. Councilmember Flynn, will you please put the resolutions for adoption and the bills on final consideration for final passage on the floor? Yes, Madam President. Thank you. I move that resolutions be adopted. And bills on final consideration be placed upon final consideration and do pass in a block for the following items.

Mr. President, I move that council resolution 20, dash 185 be adopted. Thank you, Councilmember. It has been moved and seconded comments by members of Council. Council member, said Abarca. Thank you, Mr. President, to clarify the purpose of this one. What I am trying to remove is the exclusion of a member of the public from City Council for 30 days. I feel that unless someone has committed a crime where they would naturally be able to be prohibited from this space. This is not the appropriate venue for us to limit the public's participation. And so striking the exclusion of a member for 30 days is the intent of this rule. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, support removing this for several reasons. One is that First Amendment. Secondly, the the appropriate remedy for someone who is disruptive and that you would want to remove or is causing trouble or is physically threatening is is to arrest them or charge them or cite them. That would be the appropriate measure, not excluding someone from the Hall of the People for for 30 days. And I'm sure that Councilwoman Ortega, who at the time was working as an aide for Councilman Carpio, remembers when a gentleman who frequented these chambers and became physically. Acting out and actually, I believe, drew blood from Sal's. Cheek. By throwing Lauren Romero's typewriter at him. Was banned from the building by by public office buildings, and he prevailed in a claim against the city, rightfully so. The proper remedy there would have been to have him cited for an assault, not to ban him from the house for 30 days or even longer. So I support this. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember.

This resolution moves us towards a goal that I have been asking for since becoming budget chair. And I think it's really important that we look at the details in the proposal that was sent down. I want to thank Council Member Herbold for flagging this in our earlier conversations as well. One really important thing that you will see here is the amendments that we have made to Resolution 31954. Each year the council goes through a budget process, and even years like this one, we endorse a budget for the auditor. This provides some guidance, but no concrete stability to departments. I'm really looking forward to making sure that we provide concrete, transparent, accountable information that can go between branches of government and can be shared with the public to flesh out a process in the next few months here that I hope will work for long term planning and long term stability as we seek greater outyear forecasting to allow for the Council to deliberate on items in front of us so that we can make sound financing, sound financing decisions, in particular during this economic downturn that we're in. Moving towards a shorter budgeting process makes sense to be able to do a truly reflective two three to truly reflect economic conditions. But we also must continue to have biannual budgets and seek further analysis for outyear conversations around our budgeting to ensure stability and transparency with the public. Those are the amendments that we've included today. Appreciate all of your support on that and look forward to working with you as we finalize details on what that process will look like. Thank you so much, Councilmember Musketeer, for that description of this particular resolution. Are there any other comments on the resolution? Councilmember Verbal, please. Thank you. I really appreciate Jerry Mesquita for bringing forward her amendment. This amendment address my concerns about the diversion proposed by the mayor to not just establish a one year process for 2021, but also repeal the resolution that was adopted back in 1994 to establish a two year budget process. A two year budget process provides counsel and the public greater transparency, as well as a better opportunity to plan for four out years. So keeping that as the default process makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the focus on and Councilmember Morales I'm sorry, customer mosquitoes amendment on increasing transparency for both the council and the public. And I also want to give a shout out to central staffer Tom Meisel. I know the he wrote a budget a budget issue paper on this. And I definitely appreciated the analysis that he did that made me think twice about the the mayor's resolution. And I lost track of it. The good work that he had done in that in that budget issue paper. And again, really appreciate chair Ms.. Ada bringing it back before us. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, are there any other comments on the resolution? All right, hearing none. Will Leclerc please call the role on the adoption of the resolution. Peterson. I. So want. Yes.

Present your understanding in a concise, structured, and formal summary clearly reflecting these elements.",16,"The bill passed and Cheryl sign it. Please read the first agenda item and if the Governance, Equity and Technology Committee section. To be part of the Governance Equity and Technology Committee and item one cancel 119 254 relating to the ethics code, the many sections for point 16.0 38.0 77 is for code requiring elected officials to disclose financial interests in legislative matters prior to participating in those matters and creating a limited exception to the requirement that elected officials disqualify themselves from participating. Such matters committee recommends the bill passed as amended. Okay, thank you very much. So this legislation was initiated by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission after our city council structure moved to a At-Large and district structure and currently under the ethics code. If a council member, of course shares a financial interest with a substantial segment of the city population, he or she does not need to disclose or recuse. But if that financial interest is not shared, he or she must recuse himself or herself from participate participate in voting. And with these changes presented by this new bill, basically there's a disclosure process if in fact there's a financial interest shared with a substantial segment of the population. And that sort of terminology becomes sort of critical, to be very candid, if a council member still has a direct financial interest in matters that are being legislated or discussed, of course he or she still has a conflict and there's a different mechanism that is recusal. But in a situation where there is a it is shared with a substantial segment of the population, there is a sort of disclosure process that I will describe in a minute. There will be a slight amendment from Councilmember Herbold, 12 counts for her. I go through the base legislation and will reserve some time for that. In addition, this new bill also applies to all elected officials, which now would include the mayor and the city attorney, whereas the previous ordinance just applied to council members. So what are those disclosures? If, in fact an elected official holds a financial interest with a substantial segment of the of the public? Hiroshima's post a written disclosure on the officials web page and file a copy. The Executive Director and the City Clerk. The Council member must additionally make a disclosure on public record at an open public meeting of the Council or one of the committees at which the Legislature led legislative matters discussed. The Council members shall also, before participating in that legislative matter at any subsequent Council Committee meetings, repeat the oral disclosure on the public record of that meeting . We've actually started discussing this some time ago, back in 2016, in 2017. And so we try to work with the commission sort of to better understand both the the basis, the legal and factual basis for this legislation and make sure we weren't sort of overlooking any practical concerns. So I want to thank the commissioners all for unanimously recommending this this legislation. And again, we want to air on the side of complete transparency. So that means repeated disclosures, making sure, again, a person since we were by district can have, if affected, can have district representation in critical legislative matters and still again weighing the need for transparency with having representation in a particular district. I'll tell you what, there might be a question to someone may say, but at this point, I'm going to suspend the rules to allow councilman or herbal to present a an amendment, which I don't think is controversial. And then we could have some discussion about the base amendment to have to make a formal motion. And can I just exercise my authority? Okay. By unanimous consent hopefully of for no one stands up and hollers by unanimous unanimous consent and no objection. We're going to suspend the rules now and allow Councilor Herbold to present an amendment which I was chastised for doing things that the ladies are. And let's see if we're going to chastise her as the way you did me. The way the record did, that I. Assume you have the floor it. Is owed me and I will take it. Thank you. Thank you, Council President, for allowing me to speak to this proposed amendment to the the rest of the amendments that are before the Council. This is, I think, neither strict in conflict with what has come out of committee, nor is it prescriptive to to the commission. One of the elements coming out of the legislation voted by the committee before us now is to ask that the Ethics and Election Commission develop a rule. And the rule relates specifically to what a substantial segment of the public is. And my amendment only app asks the Commission to consider whether or not the rule should. Include a distinction of whether or not the elected official is elected by district or citywide. It doesn't require them to make a distinction. It just ask them to consider whether or not there should be a distinction. Thank you for that amendment. I certainly support it. Is there a second? It's like. Okay, this is just for the amendment that for the base legislation. Any other questions about Councilman Herbold amendment? And thank you for bringing that concern back show. Thank you. So, first of all, I just want to say. I know we are trying very hard to get these things in early. I think. Getting this at 215 on the same day that we're supposed to be voting on, it doesn't. Qualify as especially when we've been working on it for about four years now. But that said, considering that you. And Councilmember Gonzalez both live in District one as an example, hypothetically speaking. How would you think the. Rule would apply and impact the two of you. Differently? What are you looking for? The rule hasn't been developed. I'm simply asking the Commission in its development of the rule to consider whether or not there should be a difference. I don't know the answer to that question. I'm just asking. They are the experts and they are they're going to be the ones who are developing the rule. I'm just flagging this as as an issue for them to consider in their rule development. Okay. And I'll just say that nothing in the amendment that Councilmember Herbold is advancing or the underlying legislation would actually resolve. The conflict of interest that I've. Identified in terms of my direct or your soundtrack's. Financial interests with regard to the sound transit. Preferred. Preferred alternative identified by the Stakeholder. Advisory Group. Which is right on top of my condo. So these rules are going to I'm still going to be completely conflicted out and will not see any really through. So there is no impact for me as an elected official making decisions in that other space. Great. Thank you. And I just want to underscore, I was not thinking specifically of that incident. I was just thinking that both of you are in district one. And how would this be impactful for the two of you just going forward and let's just say your condo issue is off. Is is not an issue. I mean, I'm I'm I'm at large representative. So I think the formula and calculation of the conflict would have to be evaluated through that at large months of substantially substantial number of people across the city would have to be benefiting it. I just happen to live in District one. Okay. So we're just going to vote on the amendment. Any other questions on just the amendment? All those in favor of Councilmember Herbold amendment s8+. Please vote i. I opposed. Okay, so the base legislation is amended. Would any councilmembers like to comment on the base legislation before we take a vote? Sure. I'll just be. Thank you. I want to say thanks to my colleagues. We have actually been working on this since 2013. I think the first time I am here appeared in front of the Ethics Commission was the summer of 2013. I believe. Now, Councilmember Gonzales was on the commission at that time and very much appreciate the fact that we've been. Going through this with. Great care. Wayne Barnett's here. Appreciate how hard that that office has been working for me. It's really about. Being able to. Represent the constituents in District seven. Initially, when I was told I could not be involved, I've had to recuse myself. As all of you know. This waterfront project is something I've been working on since. 2004 in different. Capacities, and I look forward to being able to come back and meet with my constituents here again, their concerns and make decisions with the rest of you. So thank you today for. All of your work on it. Council President Hiro leading the group and the government subcommittee and I appreciate going forward today. Very good. Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. I'm going to be voting against this today, but I want to just speak briefly. Why? I also want to state my appreciation for the work that's been done in the last few weeks to really narrowly tailor this. And I think that makes this much harder decision for me. I understand the desire of the commission to be able to focus on this unique circumstances we now have because we have district council members. And I think that that's a valid concern that is being weighed against what I think is our existing ethics in elections code, which is, I believe, one of the best in the country. And for me, that tradeoff is just not quite enough to support this right now. I understand why. And I think that reasonable minds I certainly understand why folks would support it. But for me, my preference would be to leave things as they are. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Bryant. Any other comments or concerns? Councilwoman Johnson. Just briefly, I want to say that in contrast to Councilmember O'Brien actually will be voting yesterday. I was opposed to the approach as it was originally proposed in 2016 when I first started on the council. That was because I thought that it was written a little too broadly in the instance of potential future conflicts. I live just outside a urban village in Roosevelt Ravine, a neighborhood. The way that that legislation was described to me in 2016 would have been that I would have still been allowed to vote on council matters that could potentially rezone my own property that seemed like too big of a conflict of interest. And in this instance, I would now still be prohibited from voting on the rezoning of my property, which I think many folks would perceive as an accurate conflict of interest, that I, as a councilmember, shouldn't be able to vote on changes to my own property values based on that particular conflict. So this is more this more narrowly tailored approach is one that I can support, and we'll be voting yes today. Thank you very much. Okay. I think we're cancer. I'm a skater. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the amendments that have been put forward. Thank you to Wayne and your team for trying to find a path forward. I, too, was concerned with some of the initial language that I saw. Obviously, I think that we believe that any elected should not be lining their own pockets with any policy decision that's made and that there should not be a direct financial benefit for votes that are taken. I think a great example is the one that was just mentioned. If a rezoning decision were in front of us and that related to anybody's specific property and there was direct financial benefits, that would be a conflict that I would want to make sure somebody had had the requirement to recuse themselves. Under this scenario, it appears that that is the case, and we have crafted this carefully. I think that it's important that we allow for folks to vote on policies that allow for us to act as good stewards of the public dollar and make good public policy decisions. For example, I want everybody on this council to be able to make decisions about how we create new sidewalks for people to walk carefully to school or to work. I want to be able to have this entire council be able to vote on up zones so that we can create more density and the opportunity to live in this city. Those are two examples of ways that we improve the quality of life for all Seattle and don't have a direct benefit to any one individual, though it may be a direct benefit to a region or certain portion of Seattle. It's not a direct financial lining of anybody's pocket. So I think that this is a good compromise. Thank you to Wayne again and your team and to the council members that have put this forward. I'll be supporting this version. Thank you, councilmember skater. Okay, I think we're ready to vote, so let's do that. Oh, I'm sorry, Councilmember Swatch. Thank you. Rosen Herald. I respect Councilmember O'Brien's concerns, but I think if there is full disclosure, then that is the important thing and I think that remains existing here. I will be voting yes on it. I also wanted to just note that ultimately the biggest financial impact on council members and our politicians in general is the campaign donations they get from big business, which is still going to be allowed. So I think that that's the essential point. So thank you. Thank you. Yes. Matt Herbold. Thank you. I just wanted to take a moment to speak to the base Bill, if I could. When we originally started deliberating on this piece of legislation, I turned to the Ethics and Elections website where it says that the code seeks to prevent conflicts of interest. In other words, the objective is not to make conflicts known to the public, but instead is to try to ensure that they don't occur at all. A financial interest in itself is not a conflict of interest. And that's why by asking the Ethics and Elections Commission to, through its rulemaking process, determine what a substantial segment of the public is, we are still maintaining that bright line in prohibiting conflicts of interests, because we are we are giving them the ability to to determine when a financial interest is held by primarily the council member or a small number of folks, and whether or not that really meets that that standard. So given the pivoting of this legislation, more again towards the the the the bright line that we've had for a very long time and has benefited us in the city, I am going to support the legislation. Thank you, Councilman Herbold. Okay. I believe we are now ready. Councilmember, anyone change your mind? Could do a nine. And over here I got nine and I'll kick in here for you. Okay. Keep it interesting. Okay. Please call the roll on the passage of the amended bill. So on I make sure. By Gonzales. I Herbold II. Johnson Suarez. Mr. O'Brien. No. President Herrell. All right.

A report from Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Communications I'm sorry, report from a Development Services recommendation to approve the 2017 Office of Sustainability Work Plan and receive and file the Sustainable City Commission Policy Priorities for 2017 city wide. Thank you, Elizabeth. Staff report, please. Jim Fisk will give this report. Larry Rich, I believe. I'm sorry, it's Larry Rich. Sustainability. Sorry, Jim. Don't have a heart attack. Good evening, honorable mayor and members of the City Council. Thank you for the opportunity to give a brief overview of the Office of Sustainability Work for 2017. In 2008, the City Council created the Sustainable City Commission to serve as an advisory body on issues related to sustainability and charged it with the development and implementation of a Sustainable City Action Plan. The Office of Sustainability was also created at the time to administer and support the Commission. Each year, the office works with the Commission to develop an annual work plan to provide focus to the staff work for the coming year. This year at the Commission's request, staff organize a special public input meeting to collect sustainability related community priorities for consideration. In addition, the commission and the staff held a half day work plan retreat to discuss and finalize the work plan as a result of discussions at the retreat. Commission members opted to craft their own statement of policy priorities to capture community sentiments that were not feasible to include in the work plan. As immediate action items, both the work plan and a letter from the Commission are part of your package. The workPlan itself contains three sections. The first details program management projects that will be pursued by the Office of Sustainability in partnership with other city departments or community organizations. An example of this is the forthcoming Electric Vehicle Charger Giveaway Program. The second section lists ongoing field green greenfield work activities that the office conducts to provide green services to residents and businesses such as the mulch delivery and parkway tree planting programs. Finally, the third section lists informational presentations at the office, plans to schedule for commission meetings held over the course of 2017. The letter from the Commission on Policy Priorities includes a summary of public input and a listing of high level policy recommendations based on that input. We feel that the combination of staff, work plan and commission policy priorities successfully captured the community's interest in next steps for a more sustainable city. Thank you for your consideration of these items and I stand ready to respond to any questions or comments you may have. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. I wanted to thank our Sustainability Commission for their hard work, their diligence and their vision, and pushing our city to be as bold as we can be. And so I want to thank you also to our staff for all of your work. And I just wanted to highlight that great work. And hopefully as we move forward, we can put the steps in place we need to get to a zero waste city. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman Gonzalez. Great work. I like the work plan. Just looking over it again right now, it's got great information on how we can continue being collaborative. So kudos to the commission as well as to Larry. You ran a great department and I love all of the creative ideas that have come out from this. And I know a lot of it has already been done, but still a lot of more a lot more work to do. So congratulations. Thank you. Is there any public comment on this item saying nonmembers cast your vote? There's. Okay. Come on, now. I thought I was going to get away. I'm sorry. Oh, you're not getting away. Yeah. You got opinionated community members here today, right? Go ahead and state your name. And you have 3 minutes, Gabrielle. Weeks. You've been to my house. You know where I live. I'm in the second district. Like your shirt today, Janine? I'm speaking on behalf of the Sierra Club and our 40,000 members in the area. A couple of us were able to attend this Sustainable City Commission meeting they're talking about. This is going to be great to have our city be a real leader in this area. We can you know, there's so much we can do here because we're a big enough city that we really matter, but we're not so big and unwieldy. We're like Los Angeles. I don't know how the L.A. thing done up there, but, you know, we are our mulch program. I tell my friends about this with the other Sierra Club cities and they just don't believe me. And so I've driven a number of people over to show them where. You can get it over in cities, district, by the fire station. And, you know, people, you know, we can. We have a real opportunity here to do some awesome stuff. And I hope we we dig deep and really support some some robust ideas and not just go with like the easy top two or three. So please support some some really far reaching stuff so we can really be proud of our city. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Patricia Chen, and I'm here on behalf of Long Beach 350. We are concerned about the climate because currently there is more than much more than a safe level of 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So that's where our name is. 350 We are speaking on the Sustainable City Commission Plan and policy item tonight because they contained many items that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And two in particular that we were interested in are the transition from fossil fuels to affordable, clean energy through community choice aggregation. I think that's one of the most effective things that we could do, and it's pretty painless financially. And the other is the zero waste goal. Long Beach 350 strongly supports the Don't Waste Long Beach campaign that would reorganize the trash and recycling system in a way that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions very, very, very significantly. And the zero waste goal is a key part of the concept. And I like to say, when you throw things away, there really isn't any such thing as a way you're throwing it towards someone or something else so that don't waste. And that zero waste goal is very important to us. And we ask that you join us in supporting it. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Vice Mayor Richardson and members of council. My name is Tony Demicco. I'm the co-director of Long Beach Fresh, the local Food Policy Council and a member of the Don't Waste Long Beach Coalition. I want to take a moment to thank Larry and his staff and our commissioners for their hard work on this wonderful work plan . And want to come before you today to encourage you to move forward with the recommendations established in the workPlan that include setting a zero waste goal. Moreover, as the city is figuring out how to roll out AB 1826 locally, I also want to urge the city to think of a comprehensive, citywide, exclusive franchise system that is, dare I say it, robust and meets high standards of recycling and composting and ensures that all Long Beach residents have access to organics collection. Now, at Long Beach Fresh, we believe that everyone in Long Beach should have access to healthy and affordable food. But meanwhile, nationwide, more than 50% of the food that we produce is actually wasted. And while we have a lot of great organizations that work on food recovery and Long Beach, like food finders, who are also part of our coalition, we think it's very important to have a good concrete plan for green beans and compost collection as we move forward. It's also striking to me that Long Beach is the only city in the ten largest cities in the state of California that actually does not have a green bean service for his resident for their for our residents. So in setting a zero waste goal, this is a very important thing to consider as we try to get to zero waste and implement AB 1826, we must set clear goals that can keep us on course to ensure that Long Beach is a city that is nationally recognized for innovation. And as we look at compost, you know, we see it as a valuable resource to our many community gardeners and urban farmers, and also part of a larger infrastructure that's being developed within the region for large scale composting. We want to be part of that and we want to do it in a way that's not environmentally harmful, since simply composting food at the local level can save up to 86 tons of carbon emissions as opposed to landfilling that organic matter and food. So we think these are very important things to consider as we continue to innovate as a city and create new opportunities for local gardens, restaurants and residents providing healthy meals to everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good afternoon. My name is Linda Serafin. I currently sit on the board of the Element Speech Neighborhood Association, which is a member of the Don't Waste Land Beach Coalition. And I'd like to thank the Sustainability Commission for their leadership in looking at how the city of Long Beach can protect our local environment and being open to public comment and public input in the last few months and developing their work plan that you guys have in front of you today. So I encourage you today to adopt the recommendations made in the Sustainability Commission's work plan and move forward with creating a local zero waste goal and change our current waste system. As through my involvement in my neighborhood association, I've seen a need for a change in our current waste system. One of the complaints that I get the most is overfill trash bins. And not only does that make our streets look dirty and unappealing, but it also increases the chances of waste being washed into our storm drains and into our oceans. And a simple solution to this would be to increase the number of recycling bins residents have access to and potentially organic compost bins in the future as well. And this can be achieved through implementing an exclusive franchise system for waste hauling with an exclusive franchise system. Our city could set specific requirements for haulers that could include guaranteed access to recycling and quality customer service for residents. This will ensure this is a mechanism that will ensure accountability in our city when it comes to setting benchmarks to exceed or reach our state school of 75% recycling by 2020. So I encourage you to be bold tonight and move forward with the Sustainability Commission's recommendations and create a local zero waste school and adopt an exclusive franchise system in order to ensure that Long Beach reaches its full potential. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Okay. Okay. Yes. I live in a landfill. I have a mobile home park that lives in a landfill. I am paying rent out there for an a landfill sick about 15 or now. So fucking excuse my angers me. I checks balance for the rent and also I couldn't take my outside on the landfill. You talk about recycling. Good. We could do it because we have to develop alternative fuels for this country, too. We have to get away from oil to the world and end. The era of the end of the era will come because no jail to control? No, the oil companies don't control geology. Gerald, who controls the oil companies? Because oil can run out. If if we do not develop alternate fuels and recycling all that and especially I live on a landfill. My home friendly village mobile home park and a peanut outrageous front for something in a landfill. Alternate fuel. I'd rather have rent control for the city and for the city alone, because if you weren't able to have like for housing, especially some of the land for getting rent control and also been recycling alternate fuels, well, get the country free for oil. But reality is going to do it for us. When is it going to come? A come a day that is going to come. It's going to get it's gone. It's going to come like the end of the world, being able to, you know, let go of gasoline station and say, sir, ma'am, I'll pull on the money. Well, no, no, no gasoline. I'm sorry, sir. Will be no gasoline. You'll be rioting. What will happen? It'll be rioting. I mean, rioting there. I mean, 1873, 1970s, a picnic. And now I live on a mobile friendly village, mobile home park. And we've done a PR outrageous rent. I wrote a rent control for this city. Well, it was like going away from us while we get away from oil. Well, Charles, who's going to do it for us for owning village, the prototype for alternate fuel? Question is, who could have allowed something like this people to leave for special alternate fuels to eat oil? That's like beyond me and beyond because it's the oil companies that have done this. Well, the oil companies are going to wake up the end of the world. Withdrawal is coming. But you understand the oil. You understand about your energy. You understand about geology. That's I mean, ultra fuels and in front of a control place, it's really no control. We're so out of control. You cannot believe it. It's basically something that's on alternate fuel. Give me a break. The end of the world is coming. Oil's going. Gonna run out. Wake up. Because you know what you're going to do for us. That's why we need recycling, fuel, energy efficiency and alternate fuels and geology. Because wake up. One of these days, for example, how you shouldn't be built about stuff on landfills from the village mobile home park up on. That's why I think that's living on a landfill. Pretty outrageous. Hotel rates rent control for the city of Long Beach City where it's like 600 a month. Sir. Thank you, sir. That's that's 3 minutes. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. I appreciate your time. Thank you. Next next speaker, please. Good evening. Excuse me. Good evening, counsel. My name is Desiree Uterus, and I am proud to serve as one of the sustainable city commissioners representing District nine. I excuse me. I miss my voice. I want to thank you for reviewing the Sustainable City Action Plan that Larry and his staff have put together. And I want to acknowledge the hard work of that team. I also would like to really draw your attention to the extensive amount of public comment that our commission has been experiencing over the last several months. It wasn't just one meeting, which it may have sounded like in previous comment. We have seen a substantial increase in the public coming together representing diverse environmental issues, but coming together to make their voices heard and known. And in particular, they have drawn very strong attention, as you've heard a bit here tonight, to the establishment of a zero waste goal for the city of Long Beach. But as well as a commitment to 100% renewable energy and increased walkability and public transit. So I'd ask that in addition to moving forward, the action plan that Larry's office will execute that in your own work in developing policies for this city, that you really do take some time to consider the amount of public comment and expression of interest that we are hearing from the public and that you really take a look at. I believe it's the fourth attachment in your packet tonight that, you know, has very extensive breakdown of what people have asked for by subject area, and also to serve as a reminder that the commission is happy to serve and support you in moving a policy forward that can advance these issues. And so please do not hesitate to call upon us so that we may support your work and support our city. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, everybody. My name is Karen Reside, and I'm here tonight on behalf of the Long Beach Gray Panthers. We're a participant in the Doe's Don't Waste Long Beach Coalition, and we're participants in the community workshops that were held by the Sustainability Commission. And I just want to commend the city staff lanreath and established an excellent job on the plan. Never seen a plan that's been so understandable in terms of what a city department is going to accomplish. And the Elliot Gonzalez also for holding a very open discussion about what the community wanted in terms of sustainability. And the Long Beach Gray Panthers are separate reporting the movement to renewable energy and the green waste collection and effective public transportation that services everybody in our community, including our seniors, have been cut off from the system. And we, going forward, will be working closely with these groups on these issues. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. I thank you. My name's Ellie Gonzalez. I'm the current chair of the Sustainability Commission. I'll speak briefly. I think everything that. That I wanted to say was already mentioned, but I did want to just echo my fellow commissioners comment that we want to be a body which aids this council in its decision making. And one thing that didn't make it into the work plan, but was something that we were planning on reviewing, was our oil and gas operations. And I know that there is an item tonight, so I'll go ahead and wait to extend my comments until that time. But I did want to let this council know that our commission is becoming increasingly active as climate change becomes more of an accepted reality. We we're getting a lot of a lot of input from the public for a zero waste goal, for a plan to transition off of fossil fuels towards clean energy, for a plan that creates jobs, green jobs, good paying jobs. This is a vision that we have had in our in our city for well over a decade. You know, I think our current president campaigned on it. This is something that we have a lot of excitement for in our city, and it's something that I know the community wants to implement. So I did want to ask for your approval of this year's plan. And again, I'll speak to the oil and gas later when that time comes up. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi, my name is Spencer Sabo. I'm in fourth district. I want to talk about just a couple of issues and echoing some of the stuff that's been said, I'd like to cover those regarding trash. I live in a big apartment complex and we have less trash than recycling. However, I recycling bins are smaller than our trash. And so what happens people put their recycling is stuff in the trash. So I have to go and I'm not a manager, I'm just a concerned citizen and a citizen of planet Earth. So I would like to keep the place clean. So I go through the trash doing the the recycling pickup, so I take all the stuff and put them in there. So I think what I'm driving at is the education that we need to have for the big business and big apartment owners that we need to have fliers sent to people living in a big complexes or even small apartment buildings to be educated to. What does the city vision is for the future and how can they participate? Number two, I want to talk about I think we sort of like emphasizing us citizens doing more than what the business is supposed to do. I realized was a two years ago that the city fined McDonald's for wasting water and the only business in the whole entire country got fined for wasting water. So we have a lot of waste going on in the businesses then local homes and apartment buildings. So please educate people that we can do things better to go for the zero emissions. And and that's. Thank you very much. That's it. Thank you. Our next speaker, please. Good evening, counsel. Thank you very much for having this forum or advocacy for everyone's issues. My name is Tony Taylor. I live two months every year in Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina, and ten months here in Long Beach. I'm a singer, songwriter, artist and investigative journalist for various magazines, The Nation Intercept magazine. And I belong to collectives or collectively see in Spanish in Argentina, indigenous groups and African-American groups and anyone in the diaspora. My point is, in Long Beach there is great artistic collectives here, and we have a beautiful gentrification, positive and negative in the in the city. And with the amount of investment that needs to be in this city, it's a beautiful thing to attract people. We have to find that fine line between those who are indigent, poor, who are being pushed out at the same time attract business. So that's always a tough, fine line. What what happened in Oakland recently with the horrible tragedy of the collective building that caught on fire? I want to put this on the record in the event we're talking about blight, okay. In the event that that tragedy, whatever happened in Long Beach, because we have a lot of artistic collectives here, make sure that no developer would like to use any tragedy for development to push people out to build condos or destroy the the collective. If that happens, make sure if we could police a consensus vote, consensus vote that you'd build another collective, have it affordable for people. That way you can increase the business. Keep the artistic community alive. Take care of people of color who are poor, poor, white people who cannot afford. And we're here to honor the indigenous rights of people and all humanity. So thank you very much for your time and to stay conscious of the issues, please. Thank you. I was I was waiting on the sustainability tie. I think you were going to speak on the next item. So seeing no more public comment members, please cast your vote. Councilwoman Pryce. Well, I'm sorry. Richardson okay. Bush and Kerry's. Thank you. So at this point, we're going to go ahead and take care of public comment. So we're going to. So the people we have are Bill Shorten, Ronald Morse, Larry Goodhew, Bob Joy, Ray Gavlak, Latoya Marshall and Laurie Smith.",Recommendation to approve the 2017 Office of Sustainability Work Plan; and receive and file the Sustainable City Commission Policy Priorities for 2017.

Commission budget for fiscal year 2015. 16 and 1617. And before we start, do we have any speaker slips on this item? We do have to speak. Okay. Just so I know. All right, you make it. Okay. The presentation. Just a brief introduction. Good evening, Madam Mayor. And Council. So tonight we have before you what we hope is the final budget in a in a form that you can adopt tonight. This is the last of six meetings that we've had on the budget for fiscal year 15, 16 and 16, 17. Ms.. Adair, our finance director, will be going through the presentation with you tonight. A couple of things that I just wanted to point out to you. We have prepared new sheets based on some comments that we received in the last couple of days. It's nothing. Nothing super. I guess it doesn't change anything. It just provides a little bit more description about our OPEB contributions. And so we've provided those to you which you can insert into your binders for tonight. And it's said, Ms.. Adair, we'll talk about it in more detail, but it's essentially to recognize the contributions for the OPEB contracts that we approved last month. The other thing that I wanted to mention is that I've been keeping a list of parking lot items as the term that we're using. We have. We know that. Well, have you've seen over the past month or so, we do have a fairly significant reserve. And there are some items that have we've been discussing that we might want to look at funding, and I'm happy to review those with you when we're done and we can kind of discuss how we want to move forward on those issues. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Ms.. Adair. And before you start now, I have to. Speaker slips when you. When would you like to have speakers? Probably so. Have Ms.. Adair do the presentation. And then if you have any clarifying questions and then we can do the speaker slips. And questions from council members as you're going through the presentation. That. All right. That's fine. Or you can hold them at the end. That's fine. You know. What? Let's see how it goes. Thank you. Okay. Madame Mayor, members of the City Council. Good evening, Eleanor. Dear Finance Director and I will be doing the presentation for the budget adoption. Okay. We'll go through an outline of what some of the things we're going to discuss will look at all funds budget overview. We will take a look at the General Fund budget overview. We'll look at some of the adjustments that we have discussed during the last six workshops that we held. We will go over some personnel changes. We'll talk a little bit about the capital improvement program and then we'll find out what the next steps will be. Hey. Fiscal year 15, 16, 15, 16 and 1617 proposed expenditures. So this particular slide is a presentation of the proposed city wide expenditures, and it's presented here by the fund type. As you are well aware, we have various types of funds within the city. General Fund is really the only one that provides discretionary funding. All the other funds are restricted by its nature. In looking in this particular slide, the expenditures proposed for fiscal year 1516 are near $188 million. 1617 it's $174 million in the primary. Difference of the drop is really the capital improvement program. It's about $12 million, and that really is depending on what projects public works primarily is moving forward, which projects are in their pipeline and therefore once they budget for them and they may not repeat necessarily in the following year. Kay. This particular slide is presenting exactly the same city wide expenditures, but in a little different format. Prior one was based on the fund type. This one is by department. So this presents all of those same expenditures. But now, I guess sliced and diced in a little different way. And looking into this particular presentation, you will see that Public Works Department is actually the largest one in the city. And again, this is part of the public capital improvement program that they administer. Of course, the second largest and the third largest that come up are fire and police. Moving on to the General Fund budget overview. Will transition, I guess, into more of specific fund? And again, as I mentioned before, general fund is your discretionary funding. In this particular slide. Again, we're providing you with a recap of the five years. So the two years under budget, the one we are asking you to approve, and then an additional three years of forecast. As presented before. We are expecting by the end of fiscal year 1516 to have a fund balance reserve of 30%, and that's a 38% of annual expenditures. That includes transfers out within general fund. It does drop in the second year to the 36% level. Part of the. Workshop on April 16th. We did ask in actually on May six as well. We asked for some directions and recommendations of what some of the items would be palatable to the City Council on how to address the deficit. There were a few items. One of them, as you will see presented here, use of fiscal year 1516 surplus. And there are a few other items that we will be discussing a little later in the presentation. I also wanted to point out to you, as Ms.. Warmer Dam just mentioned there, a couple of pages that we replaced and again, there is a request was made to maybe provide a little bit more information as to where the funding is coming from in terms of funding the OPEB contribution based on the contracts that got approved. So we've added a memorandum items explaining what other reserves that the General Fund has and that would be found on your page, a one that was replaced. Again, it provides the not only available fund balances now, and that's the one that you really have a discretion of determining how to use it. But it also has the restricted funds that general fund has, which you really can't go ahead and spend it because they've been either restricted or committed by actually you. Before you move on. Are you getting ready to move on on this page? No, not. Yet. Okay. Okay. Okay. Another part is included in your packet for the staff report. Specifically, I'm referring to page a 15, and that's general fund budget summary. That particular page provides a little greater detail of the revenues and expenditures of the general fund. I would like to draw particular attention to the fiscal year 1516 General Fund is getting a repayment of a loan from Alameda Municipal Power of $2.2 million. I just want to stress it out that even though on this particular slide, it doesn't show because we summarized it, it is a one time funding and we trying to explicitly say that it's a one time funding that we receive and it will not be repeated again and again as a reminder also to everybody. When we were putting together the general funds budget, we did review all the expenditures and we tried to identify some of the one time type of revenues that we may have received. Good example would be property transfer tax. We did review them and there are transactions that were more of a business to business sales that we did not expect to repeat again. They were fairly large and likelihood of them happening every year is not very high. So those were taken out. And just to point out, we didn't take into consideration all of the one time revenues. In addition, there are some transfers in that the general fund is getting in, as you can see, even on this slide. They're actually remaining the same $489,000, to be precise. And three of those are related to the parking meter fund, which is about 380,000. And we did discuss this also in detail at the April 16th meeting. We also get about $50,000 from Bayport Municipal Services District and from an assessment district, which is a sea of about $60,000. In that particular one is a trust fund. The purpose of the transfers is to really pay for the police services that they provide for municipal services district. We also make an a transfer from the parking fund because police does the enforcement and regulates the parking. When we presented I just as another reminder to everybody in terms of the fund balances when we did a presentation back in April, on April 16th, one of the additional slides that was added was related to the budget and what we thought it might be back in spring of 2011. And I'd like to remind again everybody that the expectation was that we're going to be about $22 million in a deficit. So the reason I'm bringing it up is because now we are certainly looking way better. Our fund balance specifically, and it was a combination of variety of things that included the improvement in the economy. So therefore revenues gone up and that certainly assisted our fund balance. But on top of that, the prior counsel that was sitting here back in 2011 as well as the departments, made great strides in fixing some of the expenditures and eliminating and taking care of some of the issues that occurred back then to not have this issue . And so the combination is a result that we've seen today. Thank you. So before you move on from that one, I wanted you to speak of possible pressure to when you see the difference from our revenues and our expenditures. There's. The expenditures are greater and that amount increases over time such that the annual operating results or this this coming year 1.2 million positive. By 1920, the forecast is 5.3 million deficit. So when you say so, can you speak to that? Because this is what this is what we are actually. Tonight. We're not. We're we're being asked to approve a two year budget, which doesn't go through all those years, however, based upon your forecast. This is when you carry it out. And so if you can speak, speak to that. Sure. Again, just like you've mentioned, the particular attention is in the first two years just because we are approving this. However, the city has been prudent in trying to do a forecast going forward so that we know where we may end up being. So should there be an issue, we will take certain measures now and not wait till it's too late. So as you see, we do have a deficit, annual deficits in the forecast. And one of the items that was already discussed is that the city needs to address this particular issue. Now, the increases are certainly or deficits are not large at this point in time. A lot of them are attributed to increases in the retirement contributions that CalPERS governs, and that's not necessarily something we can easily change. It is what it is when it comes down to it, and we have to make those contributions. But one of the things that the city already made strides to is working with the bargaining groups to actually address some of the OPEB type of issues. Although it's been presented and we did say it's not exactly solving our issues 100%. It certainly is helping us. And it's more of a long term solution, not just necessarily a short term solution. So part of it we started to make negotiated with the employee groups to start making certain contributions who would paying and the other post-employment benefits which specifically health. We further have to come back and review what's in the expenditures. And you're right, correct some of the structural deficit issues that we have now. Part of it is also looking, as we get closer to those years of reviewing the revenues and where we're going to be any time it goes further out into the years, even in year two. The best we can do is assume where the economy is going to go based on what we know now. A year from now, even two years from now, we'll know better where revenues are going to bring us as well and where the economy is going to end up. So that's one of the things that I think needs to be addressed as well. We are doing our best to estimate what they will be, but its budget is not necessarily a science, it's an art. And to the best of our knowledge and being again conservative in where we think it's going to go, we have certain expectations now whether they will change. Of course they will. As I said, the more we know, the the more information we'll have at that point in time. So there's a multitude, I think, of items that have to be addressed. It's not only the expenditures, it's also the revenues and where it's going to lead us in trying to negotiate, whether it's through the contracts or any other ways to figure out what can we do to balance it. So I don't think it's necessarily a one way fits all. It's going to be a combination of things. Member Ashcroft along those lines. And Mr.. You had actually made a reference to something I was going to ask about a little earlier when you talked about these one time transfer funds that are large and not likely to be repeated, because that's in, I think the last fiscal year we saw the sale of a couple of very large apartment buildings. But normally these are holdings that are held for some period of time. And I do remember some discussion at one of the earlier budget meetings where we talked about the fact that there are those, I think, five different sources of revenue in the general fund that are used to calculate salary increases. And it's the BREE Right. Balanced Revenue index. Thank you. And there has been some question of whether that particular item, the one time transfer funds, should indeed be be included. And I tried to look back and everything else I was looking at to prepare for the media. I tried to look back and find the comments and what, if anything, we said we were going to do. Looking at that moving forward, what did we write? Right. So the transfer of. Fresh might. Actually is not to you, it's the transfer tax. Yeah. Which a portion. You know we think I wouldn't say that all of it is one time we always get some amount of transfer tax. There's usually, you know, but there's usually some amount that is one time like like what you mentioned about the the apartment complexes. And I think what we discussed was potentially looking at in the future, trying to eliminate that from the from the BRY. But that would be something that we would need to negotiate. As currently that is the balance revenue index does currently include the transfer tax and that's something that we would need to negotiate with. So that's in the bargaining agreements, correct? Vice mayor. And just to be clear, the true one time revenue that's used to balance the first year of the budget. It has a 1.2 positive at the end expenses of revenues is the repayment of the loan $2.2 million? That correct. That contributes. Absolutely. So that one. We can. I. I have concern over that. And that that's something talked about in January. You're highlighting it. I am assuming that we don't have any other outstanding loans that can carry us through this year. So I'm looking at. Asking for ideas, not tonight, but asking for ideas on when we talk about fixing our structural problems. All I hear is structural problems. I'd like to have it pinpointed so that we can attach a fix to it. And I understand budgeting is is not exact, because the if we look back on history, the projections property tax and transfer tax. Are are variable and there are certain things out of our control that affect those numbers. But I think we have the benefit of history and looking at those and we can make those a little tighter at least. Based on what I saw from the look back of four years. But I'd like to look at. Some caution and some steps, some checkpoints that we have as the first year rolls out is how do we plug the gap that we how do we address the gap that we plugged with $2.2 million from the beginning ? Because we could say that we have actually a $1 million deficit in the first year because it was $2.2 million of one time, really one true one time money, not vagaries of the transfer tax, but truly one time money. I actually would like to address that as well. The loan repayment from Alameda Municipal Power is $2.2 million, but in order to repay it, in essence, there was, if you want to call it, a swap of revenue, because I am in essence prepaid portion of their franchise I'm sorry, pilot in advance. Yes. They advanced us some money. So that advance is already in the general fund. So instead of funding both and pretty much trying to eliminate advance and making it more of you know, they pay us as the year comes this particular year, 1516 is when they not going to pay us $1,000,000, but instead they will repay in full the $2.2 million. So if you actually take the net of the two, the net really true increase and true one time money is $1.2 million that is being added to the fund balance in 1516. So should. Win it. It's temporary. It's only going to happen this year. Correct. Because in essence, per direction that was given at the last meeting that we've had on the budget. One of the things that was discussed is council agreed that maybe we should use portion of the fund balance which is in essence your surplus from 1516. They happen to be the same toward 1617 year as part of the balancing component. So if I can add on to that. So I think what Adair is saying is that the net one time is 1.2, not 2.2. Correct. So I just want to make that clear. The other thing is there are two thoughts on structural deficit. One is a utility users tax. And I do plan on coming back on that. And I've been doing a little bit of research just on my own. We really need to take a look at that. We've met with an attorney that specializes in utility users tax, and they're going to give us an estimate about really how much money we're leaving on the table because our ordinance is so outdated. So I will be bringing that back to you. I think the other issue that we haven't talked tonight about, but we've talked many, many times about is the smoothing effect, which we know is a five year effect. And so, I mean, I think what I think it's a really good we do these projections because we need to keep our eye on the ball and we need to recognize that we cannot we we need to continue with our bite, our belt tightening, and we don't want to go on any spending sprees. But they are projections. And I think we need to continue to be frugal. But we do have I think there are some tweaks that we can make, some adjustments as we go along that I think are going to that are going to assist us in our fiscal essentially being sustainable. So. Member, Daisuke. Thank you. Thank you very much, Ms.. Adair. I think the charge that you have here is very helpful in many regards. And let me just kind of go over possibly three issues. I think what this chart shows here is that, you know, on the expenditure side, when it comes to budgeting on the expenditure side, it's something that for the most part we can pretty much control to the extent that, you know, we have labor agreements and that wages and salaries comprise such a large portion. And I'm speaking only of our general fund, of our general fund budget. And to the extent that, you know, we have certain expectations with regard to, you know, equipment and other kind of non-salary things which come up on a routine basis. So on the expenditure side, it's pretty much something that that is not just within our grasp of the two years, but over perhaps the next 3 to 4 now out to five years. So when you look at just the expenditures alone from the two year budget of 80.7 million to 83.3 million to the forecasted of 86.2 to 80 8.7 to 91.0. Basically what you're seeing is on an annual basis, you're seeing expenditures are expected to rise 3.2% from 16 to 17, 3.5% from 17 to 18 , and then 2.9% from 18 to 19, and then from 19 to 22.6%. And when you compare the expenditure annual increases versus the Conservative revenue estimates, you can see that the rate of growth, the annual rate of change in most cases almost doubles. The expenditure rate of change on an annual basis doubles what? The revenue rate of changes. And actually that's good, though, because what that means is that staff is coming into this on a conservative basis. As we you know, we don't want we don't want staff to come up with these numbers that that we want to at least know, you know, that we're going to come into this. So this so I appreciate this chart on the on the expenditure side and the revenue side as I think ultimately what this is, is this is this structural deficit in summary form for those of you, you know, who are here this evening or listening in the public, you know, what the structural deficit basically refers to is that on the expenditure side, you've got certain costs that are baked into the cake and you know that they're going to happen. And then on the revenue side, for the most part, you really don't have the the the revenue that's generated on a yearly basis to cover those costs , forcing you to therefore dip in to what savings you have. Fortunately, in the city of Alameda, you know, we've got this our savings is the general fund balance. And for a variety of reasons, you know, we've had a very good general fund balance. I mean, the policy that was put in place was set way back in December 5th, 1989 of having a general fund balance of 25%. It's now I think our policy is officially 20%. But nonetheless, I think the city council past has been proactive in making sure to have a good policy in that regard. So that's something that that I want to make sure to keep. So that leads me to the third question is because one of the things that we ended off last time was the possibility of having some kind of program put in place to move us down from from the 30% plus fund balance that we have to 20% , which in my mind I felt was I was very skeptical of, because I think for a variety of reasons, you know, you chip away at your fund balance. Is it really necessary to have a specific, tailored program to get us to 20%? I mean, you know, things happen. So I guess one of the things that I'd certainly like to hear in the course of the conversation is, is the what? Whatever happened about that? And let me just end by this. And later on this evening, I do want to go into the Parks and Rec budget. I think there's been some good news there that I think we should share. But I also want to mention the Parks and Rec budget and in the context of when I compare it to, say, the public safety budget. But I'll do that later. Thank you. Member. Ody is probably. Thank you, Madam Mayor. Just not to put too fine a point on it, but if you look at I don't have the dollar to just have the percentages. But in the purse, the purse smoothing you talked about in our contribution in 1415 is is 53. It goes to 55 for safety in 15 1658, three basis points jump 16, 17, 61%, another three basis point jump in 17, 1863 to 2 basis point jump in 1819 and then another two in 1920 to 65 and then it levels at 65 and then we expect that to stay at 65. We expect that to go down. Or do we not know or what system? Actually, I was at one of the conferences actually participating in governmental accounting and auditing conference and the chief actuary for PERS was one of the speakers and as a matter of fact, is one of the questions that was kind of inquired during the conference as to where the rates will go. And very interesting thing that he did say, again, this is his kind of, I guess, thinking doesn't mean that it's going to necessarily happen that way. But he didn't really expect the rates to go down. They will probably be at that level. But he didn't expect them to just drop. So I can't you know, obviously it's not necessarily something he said officially or any of that, but that's just a conversation that happened during that particular conference. And he did say that. So I guess then, you know, we're seeing these increases in expenses and there would be some expectation then that that would level off, you know, going out five years. You know, it is not, you know, not a science. It's it's an art. And there's so many things that can happen. But going out five years, we would expect when we start seeing the 2021 and the 21, 22, you know, that we would see a leveling out of our cost increases if we're attributing all of our cost increases or most of our cost increases to this smoothing . Correct. Now, you also have to remember, Perce is trying to be conscious of what they're doing as well. So just like the city is in trying to address its liabilities, so PERS is going to do potentially similar things. So whether they going to revise their assumptions or not, this is something that city does not control at all. And as I mentioned before, you know, which is because we remember and it really is out of our control, we'll just we'll have to pay or contribute exactly what they tell us to do. And at this point, yes, you're correct. Our expectation is it's going to level off. But I can't predict it again. We've talked about it actually in prior meetings as well. Purpose is just one component. We also have help for active employees and things like that. So it's again quite a combination of items to look at and not just just one thing, but I don't think it's really prudent to just focus on one. But as we move forward, I hope we can, you know, one, recognize that that's the main route of our annual operating result deficit and that, you know, we also don't lose sight of that and that we, you know, continue to focus on on ways we can be more efficient and control our costs. So I'd like some clarification then. You don't anticipate a reduction, though. So when you look at the year 1920 and you see the 5.3 negative. A balance or deficit. At a minimum, would you anticipate. We would not have a reduction in the next year. We would continue with the 5.3 million deficit. Provided that we keep revenues as they are, and if we don't review the expenditures and look at any other items. So there are certain things that are locked in in our expenditures. Yes. Those are the ones that we can control. More so, but more maybe in terms of we obviously have the operating expenses that are in there. There are certain components of the salaries and benefits that we can control, but a lot of them might be locked in. So but in five years, we may come up with other ideas as to the contract, because we do have a number of contracts that are coming up for renegotiations. I understand the safety are now locked in, but there are some other items. Can you clarify? Wasn't it through December 20. 19, 2021 and 2021? That's actually the next year after this. The contract is locked in for public safety. Right. But that doesn't mean that. Yes. You can't have those conversations and have these conversations outside of the country. You know, we were within the time frame. The contracts were valid, and we think that. Was part of the motion to extend. There had been ongoing labor surveys. You know, based on the current contract, it ends December 20, 21, as I just said. Correct. Okay. So given that the facts we have currently in front of us. Thank you. Mm hmm. Any other comments on that one? Thank you. You may continue. Right. So this particular slide shows the revenue sources again within general fund by various I guess the source of the revenue in the top three. I just want to point that out. The top three revenue sources are property tax, sales tax and utility user tax, as his former name just mentioned. And we've presented that before. The way we've seen the current trend of utility user tax, it's going down year after year after year. And so one of the items that we need to address is the city. What can we do about that particular source? Because it's not that we're not receiving utility user tax, but one of the reasons is our ordinance is outdated and there's so much more new technology that's out there that our ordinance is not capturing that. We could have been receiving revenue from that. Just as a point the transfers in and loan repayments and other section. It's kind of a lavender color. 5% does include that particular $2.2 million of loan repayments. So I just want to make sure and identify that that particular source is a one time. True, one time. Okay. This just shows you the second year under budget. Our revenues in this year, again, exactly the same. You would say a story. Top three revenue sources again as property tax, sales tax and utility user tax. And in both years, it accounts for just a little over 50%. We've talked earlier about city wide expenditures that we showed by department. In this particular case, this is a presentation of just the general fund expenditures by department. A little different picture, but again, it's only one fund. The two largest departments, as expected, is police and fire. We have lots of people. It's a service organization. Labor cost is pretty much it and therefore that's majority of the staff we have in those departments within general fund. And so it's expected that they would be the largest ones and it's about 70% in each year and it pretty much stays the same the percentage wise in both fiscal years. This is a little, again, different presentation of general fund expenditures. Again, exactly the same amount, all of those same expenditures, but now being reversed and rather presented by type of expense or category as you see salaries and benefits, the largest, which is the labor component. And then we have the operational costs, which is your material supplies, any contracts or agreements that departments have in cost allocation. Again, if you look and add together to salaries and benefits, it's about 80%. And again, same thing. We are a service organization. Labor is primary things that cities providing. It's a service 80% it's going to be usually the labor cost is the highest. Just as a point, the operational costs, we did not include any increases in there unless contracts agreement actually specified increases. So if what's already part of the contract, then obviously we'll go with that. Those been approved already. But there's no cost of living adjustments included as just a point probably going forward because cost of living does increase and cost of services increases. At some point it wouldn't really be sustainable to not provide any increases because it's in essence. A cut to the departments if they cannot provide those services if they grow. 1517 adjustments. So we've talked about during our April 16th and May six meetings. What are some of the ways that we can address the deficit within 1617 budget again? 1516 fiscal year. We are rather adding to the fund balance, $1.2 million, but 1617 we have an annual deficit. So the staff provided a listing link and a menu item in essence, for the Council to consider based on the directions that was given. In our understanding, these are the adjustments that are currently included in the general fund budget as it is presented to you tonight. We have eliminated the proposed Administrative Services Coordinator position again because originally it was included. It would have affected both years and by reducing it, you see it impacts both year one in year two. We also reduced the transfer out to the vacation fund by $75,000. We've reduced the contribution for police and fire fleet in total 100,000. We have increased per the request of the Council and we're giving additional transfer to the library. It's $100,000 in both fiscal years. But if you look in the projection, the projection includes those funds all the way in a five year period. $100,000. What it provides is it giving library to be open additional 2 hours on Wednesdays, and it also provides additional funding for library material purchases. So which library will be open more on Wednesdays? I believe it's the main library. That's correct. So does that mean that the main library will have more, more hours than the other two? Even more. Because it currently has more hours than the other two, doesn't it? Jane, could you come up? Yeah. That evening. Jane Psaki, Library Director The $100,000 represents adding 2 hours we chose Wednesday. Wednesday would allow hours at the main library to open on Mondays and Tuesdays at noon and close at eight, and then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, open at ten, and then have their closing days instead of having two days that open, you know, at one time and then another day where it's odd and then it goes back to a different day. It gave us some uniformity. Wednesday mornings will allow us to do more class visits and offer more programing in the mornings that we currently can't do. We looked at the flow and the kinds of programs that we reduce, the number of programs offered in selecting the Wednesday morning. And yes, the main library has more hours than the two neighborhood libraries. And how much of the money is for extending the hours. $40,000 and the other 60,000 or. The materials budget. You know what type of materials you don't know at this point. The money that goes into the materials budget is up to the book selectors. But we intended to be print and e-book and media. And since it's only two years, we would not start a subscription like a new database or periodicals. Any other questions on the library? Yes. In just an hour, the new material is distributed across. Yes. Our library has what we call a floating collection. So if there's a book at the main library that's of interest in the branch library, we can send it out to the branch. And when it gets checked in there, it belongs to the branch until it's needed someplace else. So it eliminates the need to buy a lot of multiple copies. And if the branch library and thinks their branch is a little short on cookbooks, they can go to another library, shop the cookbook selection and send it out to the branch library until they don't need them anymore. Meredith. Thank you. Now. It's not so much on the library. Actually, it's for finance director there. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, yes. Thank you very much. Now this chart on the fiscal year 2016, 2017, basically what you're saying is when we last met and it was, I believe April or I can't remember there was that and I have it in front of me. There was that chart that had what would happen in the 1.4 reduction option. So of the 1.4 reduction option, there were 11 items. Most of them were in 1617, fiscal year, 1617. There was one kind of thing in 1516. But of the 11 items, there was two that really popped out was, for example, the community resource officers. We had a member of the public asked to speak up on behalf of that. And also I think there was recently a letter to the editor on that. And also, well, that was the one that popped out for me. And so what we're basically saying is of the 11 items that were in the chart from May eight, May discussion six, basically we're covering it now with the that one time and that one time is basically the 1.176 thousand that you see here. So here's the question that I have. And I'm going to speak specifically to the fire issue because we spoke at length about the ambulance issue. So we're I believe that the way that I'm reading this is we're going to cover that $408,000 in expenditures that we see needing to occur in 16 to 17. So the question, though, is that if we cover it that year and once we hire the people to cut it for those positions, that means that in 17, 18 and 18, 19, those staff members are there. Well, I think there's two different things that we're mixing up the ambulance that we're we're proposing as one of the cuts, potential cuts for the department. Those people already here, I believe the one you're talking about is actually the grant from the county, and that would be additional positions that are limited term positions. So I think it's two separate items. Okay, great. And I think that was the issue is that the ambulance is there already. Just don't want to see it go away. Correct. And so it's not on the list. So even as it is not on the list anymore for 64 hours. 16, 17. It also still means, though, that we have to make accommodations in subsequent years because it's still there. That's correct. So what you the projection that you see right now, the five year projection. So all of those items that were proposed to say should council decide to eliminate, it will eliminate. But because we didn't, they are within those projections. So those are. Rolled into the cost. Yes. Oh, that's important. That was. Correct. So those are part of that budget. So we did not take them out. So in a way, when we make a decision with regard to the for keeping the ambulance which is there now at Harbor Bay, attitude to a two and a $408,000 in 1617. We're making basically we're baking that into our cake for 17, 18, 18, 19. That's correct. And that is also what's you know, those are all those costs are contributing to your your structural deficit. Exactly. Exactly. So but these are the type of eyes wide open decisions that we have to make. Correct. Member member Ashcraft. Thank you. And so I'm I'm not sure if we are talking about this as well, but it does involve the fire budget. And I'm looking now at exhibit one, which is the fiscal year 15, 16 and 1617 budget transmittal letter, and it's on page six of 11. There's a paragraph about the community peer medicine grant. So just to recap, in October 2013, the fire department was provisionally accepted by the State of California Emergency Medical Services Agency to represent Alameda County in the Community Peer Medicine Pilot Project. And yet I see Chief Light coming up. And so. A. Couple questions. Remind me how long the pilot program lasts and what happens when the pilot program ends. Because I'll just get to the you know, the entirety of the note I made while improving health care needs and outcomes is a laudable goal, we're trying to keep people who chronically use the emergency room of the hospital, our local hospital, as their primary care provider. It's a laudable goal, but it's not a city mission and is more appropriately underwritten by mental health systems. That is now the county that is running both Alameda Hospital and Highland. So that was really long. Tell me if you want me to go back over any of it, but I'd love your input. No, I. I understand. The funds that we received from Alameda County to fund this project is for two years of once those funds run out, the the program will be dissolved if if it isn't funded in another way. We're hopeful that the the program will show a large savings to the local hospitals and that they may come up with a plan to help continue the program. But other than that, once the grant funding that we've received is gone, if there isn't anything else in place, the program would be dissolved. And so then I just want to share that I have at least begun the conversation with Alameda Hospital just in an informal basis, because I ran into one of their administrators at a function and said, you know, this is a great program and really helps you. And and what she wanted was empirical data. And so I'll talk to you offline. But I you know, you may already be in contact, but. I and we are we'll collect a large amount of data. And I think there's an awful lot of people out there that will be served by this this program that will decrease the cost of emergency rooms and therefore the hospital overall. Right. And I don't dispute it one for 1/2 in at least a couple of us on this board served on the board of directors at the hospital. But we're a city and we don't have a city health department. And I you know, I want the savings in cost to the emergency room operation the hospital, to be borne by the appropriate but very appropriate party. But it was very prestigious for our department to be chosen. And I think, you know, you've done a great job, from what I understand. And we just we just found out that the 13 programs that are starting in the state, only three started on time as being one of them. And the community medic that started on Monday was actually the first one in the state. Oh, we're real proud of that. And it's thanks to you online. Brody. Before you go. Sorry. Sorry again, not to put too much of a finer point on this, but, you know, this is the point of pilots, right? You know, if they don't work and we don't do them anymore and then we don't get the money, but then we don't spend the money because we don't have the program. And then it they do work and it serves as an incentive to policymakers such as US or in HHS or in the state to say this is something that works, this is something that saves money, this is something we want to fund. And then we we can have something longer term like that's okay. Thanks. Thank you. I also wanted to add, when we're talking about filling some of these vacant positions, my understanding that we won't require as much overtime. So there are some savings, is my recollection based on the last presentation. And I don't know if that's these positions that we were speaking to a few minutes ago that came up. But I think some of the vacancies in police and fire. We'll be filled. That's a word authorizing feeling if you're. Referring specifically to the fire department. I'm not sure. I just thought that there was a discussion about savings of overtime by so. Many times a position you you save overtime. But not every. But that's only in departments where overtime is available and that's what but I think for these positions in public safety. That was I think referred specifically to the fire department because the proposal by the department was by reducing the hours for the ambulance or eliminating that particular ambulance, those people that are currently on the ambulance will go back to our regular emergency services operations, which means they have more staff and it will reduce to over time, in essence. I thought we were filling some vacant positions, though, as part of this budget. That's right. You did have some vacant positions that were on your list. This was from May 6th. Um, and we. That's right. So one of the things that we offered at that time was to not fill your vacancies. Um. And we chose not to do that. We, we, this council chose to go ahead and fill the vacancies. So I think that's one of the items that was proposed, as you may remember. One of the things that we have done in this particular budget in both fiscal years is we reviewed what are the current vacancies or the vacancies that we believe will happen. Let's say when we come to July one, 2015, and then looking at the vacancies and the number of vacancies we've reviewed with the departments as well as with Human Resources Department, to figure out what are the realistic timeframes that we will be able to fill those vacancies. So for that particular reason, they we've identified in saying in certain cases, even though we have a position available on July one, it's going to be unlikely due to not sufficient resources, let's say, in H.R. to fill that vacancy on July 1st. So it may take them other than the actual recruitment time, but it may take them to get to that particular vacancy recruitment some period of time. And again, various department departments have vacancies. It's a competing priorities among all of those departments which vacancy to fill first. So by looking at those, we've estimated, what will the vacancy savings be based on the hire date, expected hire date of those particular people in those positions? So this particular budget. Takes into account those known vacancies. On top of that, when we were doing a proposal as to, okay, what are some of the ways to eliminate our deficit, we said, Well, what if we will not fill those vacancies at all? Let's say for I believe it was 12 months, period, 18 months in what would actually give us. What are the savings going to be? So that was part of the presentation to potentially not fill those positions, in which case council did vote saying, no , let's not do that, and therefore it wasn't included in this particular budget. Oh. Do we anticipate that this budget will address the overtime issue for public safety in regards to reducing it? So you so in the fire department, I believe they have how much budgeted for overtime? It's about 1.2 million. 1.1. So the issue in the fire is that in the past they've had the safer grant for six positions that Safer grant expired. And so what they have done is to fill those slots essentially with overtime because they don't have those positions funded and they've submitted the application again for the safer grant. And we should be hearing within the next couple of months whether or not we get that. And if we do, and I think maybe this is your what you were talking about was if we do fill those positions and we do get the safer grants, that will eliminate that overtime, not not 100%, but I think we're about half a million dollars to half a million dollars. So by filling those positions, you're correct that it reduces the amount of overtime. Okay. And then if at some point then will we be looking at staffing levels for. Public Safety or fire department specifically in order because of my understanding, that's part of how we end up with over time. Will we be looking at the staffing levels? Is that part of this? Will that come up separately? I mean, that's up to the council. If that's something that I mean, I think what we had heard, at least from the fire department, was that if we were no, that would we could look at that and that would be something that would affect the service level. But if that's something that the council wants us to review, that we can do that. Now, that's something in our parking lot. That's I don't have that in my parking lot right now, but I absolutely can add that. Look at the staffing levels. So I personally will want us to look at that at some point, regardless of the overtime and whatnot. And I think you and I agree. I mean, I think we need to look at everything. I think that's that's a fair item to look at. I do recall from when this came up before we talked about the overtime and there was the prospect of eliminating the Bay Farm Harbor Bay Ferry Ferry. Hello, ambulance. We're taking them by water. Now that the problem is, yes, these folks are racking up a lot of overtime and it's a problem not only for budgetary reason, it's a problem for our personnel because especially when you're doing the kind of work that public safety is doing, in this case, it's fire. They're more prone to injuries and therefore, you know, loss of time because of that, an expense to the city from from medical costs. So we do need to find that balance. We don't want to be stretching our personnel, you know, beyond the limit. They should be stretched. And at the same time, we we want to, I'm sure, staff as cleanly as possible. And the other thing I always think about is, yes, we can add new, new members so we don't have to use so much overtime. That's a good thing. But remember, in addition to that salary is also that new employees benefits. And then, you know, we've wrestled with this whole issue of health care for our current employees. Retirement costs, retirement costs, I mean, health care costs after they've retired and, you know, all the other expenses. So it's there's a lot to be considered, but yeah, a fair discussion to have. And at some point we should look at that. Remember Audi. But if the safer grant comes through, then that's really not an issue, though this budget. If the safer grant is there, funds the staffing levels that Iris asked for? That's correct. I don't know how long the save for Grant is good for. Is that one year to year. Two years. So, yes, it eliminates the issue for two years. So, I mean, I'm not sure the value of looking at it if the safer grant is awarded. But, you know, if it's not awarded, then, you know, we do have something we need to look at. And you clarify, I thought you said that that would deal with half a million of the anticipated 1.1 million. Correct. So just 600,000 was never going to address Korea. You're never going to not address the entirety? Well, you're never going to eliminate over time 100%. I mean, that's the nature of of of their I mean, they have the most number of staff. They have one roughly 100 each. You're always going to have some amount of overtime, so you're never going to get it to zero. So I think we should be looking at everything is there. So we had two council members that spoke to that at this point and I was once pictured now just a vice mayor. Just a couple of things on the Safer grant. Part of it. We should be looking at what happens if we don't get it and if we do get it, we still have to plan for what happens when it disappears at some point. Because it will. So we're just postponing that. And I think looking at the nature of the calls. Mostly being medical. How do we evolve the system in the practice to match with the service that has to be delivered today? And are there some things that traditionally have been in the service that may be handled by another department and or another function of the city? Hazmat type work is is one that comes to mind that might be spread apart. And we can look at other models. I know Sunnyvale and Rohnert Park have cross-training between police and fire, and I think those were brought up a few years ago. And those things we might have to look at. Another member comes at this time, you may continue. Thank you. I do also want to clarify that the current budget, as it stands right now, assumes that we do not get safer ground. So just as a just clarification point. That's a good thing is. Not. Does not not. So that's what 2 million. A little over 1 million, isn't it? It over the two years, 511,000 a year. I'm going to look to. Okay. Fire departments prior, chief. 2.2 million over two years. Yes. Okay. So that would basically like eliminate our 1.2. Operating deficit for the second year? I don't believe so. The amount of overtime that we've currently added because we don't have six additional firefighters was half a million dollars. Okay. So that's one of those one time revenue. So I think we need to be careful with that. They were. Correct. Grant funding. There's no way to predict that you will receive it every year. True. So. Correct. And hence why the department is hoping to get this particular grant, because it certainly would be helpful. Thanks for clarifying. Mm hmm. Can we move on? Thank you. Okay. So just to address a quick item here, we talked about it a little bit earlier is the use of 1516 surplus. We've talked about all the other items. But again, just to bring it up again, one type of one time source, in essence, using a fund balance that is proposed here again as what we believe was a council direction. Personnel changes. New full time equivalent positions. So what are the positions that we've added in this particular budget? I.t. I.T. director of technology and innovation, part of the city manager's budget. And it also includes the information technology coordinator. Just as a reminder, those positions are within I.T.. However, half of each of the position is funded in split, actually equally is funded by General Fund, and the other half is municipal power. Come on. I'm sorry. That was for the second position. The information box. Both positions 50% funded by General Fund. And the other 50% is funded by AMP. Okay. So that's something that I think we could add to this chart. But note this is a page here that could be added. Okay. Thank you. Community development. We're adding a management analyst, and this is specifically to support economic development. And we're also adding supervising building inspector. For base reuse. We're adding redevelopment project manager and executive assistant. For Public works. We adding a project manager to that particular position will be partially funded by air and public works. And for having that on there. Pardon me. Thank you for having that on there. Of course. And then additional positions. Public works, maintenance worker to. There are also various upgrades to the existing positions that are incorporated in the budget for all the city funds in 14, 15, 16. The cost of the upgrades is 145,000, and in 1617 it's about 187,000. And Mrdak, can you just remind us what do you mean when you say upgrades to existing positions? It's going to be an upgrade, let's say, from a a clerk level to like, say, in executive secretary type of position. Okay. Moving on to your craft. Well. All right. Um, the, um. Yeah. If I can find it. Oh, for the the i t director. The positions that you just showed us. Um. Does that include an update on the status of our electronic records management and retention program? I know I've discussed this a little bit with the city manager's office, and this was something that started in the previous administration, I want to say, back in 2013. And it's it wasn't completed before. Alex Nguyen, I think, was the assistant city manager who was handling that. Will that come under the umbrella of this new department? This new department? Okay, great. We'll look for redactions on that. Thank you. Okay. So moving on to the capital improvement program. Over the two year period, we expect to spend about $55 million. And this particular graph presents the type of categories that we will spend a $55 million on. As you see, we have sewer, storm, water, streets, parks, pedestrian and bikes, various city facilities and some other categories. The other really included some of the very small projects that. Individually. We're quite small, so I kind of group them together. But if you need to see all the details, it really is coming from the CHP budget that's included in your budget book. So this particular table shows some of the major projects that are expected in this two year period. As you see that, I tried to group the categories and again, this is not 100% that's listed. These are the very large projects that are individually large. Some of the larger ones you see is rehab of the sewer. 11 and a half million streets, pavement management program, $10 million. And again, this is city wide and its variety of various funding sources that's included, including Measure B-BBEE grants that department gets and a variety of other contributions. You clarify with an emergency water supply fall under something like this. But it. No. Emergency water supply. Bob Hahn, Public Works director, has traditionally been under the fire department purview. So if you're talking about emergency water supply for if the water system goes down with the estuary crossings, saltwater pumps, etc., that have been discussed, that's basically a fire department program, not a public works program. Okay. And that would come out. Traditionally, that comes out of the fire department budget. That's correct. That would if it ever happened. Okay. So historically, it has not happened in this city because we don't have it, right? Yes. Okay. So if we wanted to start something like that, we would we would be looking at the fire department budget to fund that the emergency water supply. It's my understanding that's a parking lot issue. That a lot of people have that on the list. Right. But it doesn't come out of capital improvement. Thank you. Yeah, in just for clarification, in in Madumere, you were talking about emergency water to fight fires when you were talking about the pumps. And so, I mean, it is it may be an overstatement to say we don't have that supply, because if I understand correctly, we have a fire boat that has capability of pumping water from the bay, from the estuary. So, I mean, we have we don't have the kinds of pumps, portable pumps you may be speaking about. But to say we have no emergency water supply, I think might be an overstatement. Is it? Well, I think Chief Long wants to talk about this. I think what we talk I think last I heard. Was that may be too strong a term, but it. Was. Trucks being able to pump out of, you know, from the fire boat into water tanks. But we don't have water tanks. We don't currently have water tanks. We actually started training today using the fire boat and supplying a fire engine on land. We were successful at that. We need to find out just exactly how far we can pump into town. But using the fire. But we won't be able to reach the entire town. So we'll need to come up with some sort of alternative system and we'll be forming a committee to research that. We'll bring something back to the council. Thank you. Can can we just get a timeframe on this? Because I know it's been it's been raised a number of times, sir. When when would you anticipate either of you this warmer damage, if long? But you're talking about. Sure. About what I was just talking about. You know, report back about ways the city is going to explore addressing emergency water supply in an emergency in a disaster. Situation for months. Four months. We have recently researched some of the different types of systems that are out there. We need to research how each of the different, different ones we could deploy effectively in the city and then weigh each of those as far as cost. Yeah. And I'm not trying to arrest you with an answer, but just just to get an idea, because I know the topic does come up. And so it would be nice if you all could look to then getting something on our agenda. For 20 years. From now. And we wanted to involve the community in this in this project also. So it's a matter of putting a community together and getting getting started. My question really started in regards to does it fall under this capital improvement program? I didn't know that it would come out of the fire department budget for this. Not actually sure. No, it would not. I mean, yeah, yeah. That's a parking lot issue. I mean, the parking lot issues, essentially, just so we can talk about it really quickly, is you have, you know, in your general fund, you have roughly, you know, you're looking at 38% right above your reserve level. So you have a delta there, which I think we decided is about $15 million. And give or take a little bit depending on whether you want to do 20 or 25%. And so what do you do with that money? And that's what the parking lot is. We have a list. And when we're done, we'll we'll talk about that, what's on that list and then how we're going to bring that list back to you. Right. And before we continue at 1030, we need a motion to consider the remaining item, which is for be appropriation limit, which should only take a few minutes. As my. Understand. That's a very, very short item. And that requires four votes. Do we have a motion to do that. Move. Second. All those in favor. I. Oppose abstentions. It carries unanimously. Thank you. Right now. Member de sa. Yes, thank you. On capital improvements, I just want to make sure to say what we have before us are a whole list of capital improvement items. At the last council meeting when we were going over the budget, I had inquired about the distribution of certain capital improvement projects across the city of Alameda because speaking bluntly, I think . Speaking bluntly, I think a lot of West Centers sometimes feel they're shortchanged. But the reality, though, in terms of the data that was presented by city staff, when you look at the fiscal year, just one fiscal year alone, in eyeballing the maps that were prepared, for example, for sidewalk repair, it looks pretty evenly distributed with a slight nudge towards central Alameda, but it looks pretty evenly distributed. And that's when it comes to sidewalk repair for fiscal year 2014, 2015. You know, previous years, other years, I don't know. But I think going forward, maybe this is one thing that council said, you know, make sure to regularly ask so that we're gathering this this type of information and making it publicly available so that so that authorities don't become. Other than stories. Likewise for Age of Pavement. When you look at the ages of the streets, we're looking at, for example, streets that are. Younger than, I think, five years or anything. My eyes are combat street streets that are 6 to 10 years and the streets that are 11 to 15 years and etc., etc.. When it comes to the ages of our pavement, you know, the new streets seem to be pretty well distributed relative to across the different parts of Alameda, West and central and East End. So again, there, you know, it's good to gather this kind of information and perhaps making it a part of the ongoing community improvement project discussion. So I just want to also say thank you very much to Public Works director Bob Hahn and to Public Works staff member Liam. Them calling for. Mr. King to be here to. Know, for generating the information. Very much appreciated. Ben Brody And just to follow up on that, I mean, and in this book, you know, there's a big part of the city that's not even on this map. So we also need to take care of the West and we also need to make sure that we take care of Bay Farm Island. Know that. It'll always be in every map. There on my maps. Okay. Moving along. Okay. So the next step we are asking or the staff is asking you to adopt a resolution approving the operating in the capital budget for fiscal years 15, 16 and 16, 17. And there is a second resolution. We're asking you to adopt a resolution for the successor agency. And again, for two fiscal years, 15, 16 and 16, 17. That concludes my presentation. And if you have any more questions, I'm here to answer them as well as all the department directors. So we do have two speakers on this. Member Ashcroft. Thank you. Thank you, Mary Spencer. I think I just have to, um. Thanks, Mr.. For the nice presentation. I'm looking again at the the budget transmittal letter and on page eight of 11, there's the section on base reuse. And these are bullet points. This is what the, the objectives of our different departments are for these next couple fiscal years. And so for base reuse the, you know, facilitate the transfer use and development of formal federal lands by effectively implementing planning and contractual development, etc.. The last bullet is facilitate state legislation to restore tax increment funds to former military properties. And I was just wondering, what does that mean? Well, I mean, who's who's facilitating? Is this our lobbyist in Sacramento or maybe. Well, state legislation implies Sacramento. Mr.. Good evening, Mayor. Councilmembers Jennifer Ott Chief Operating Officer for a point. So we do have a state lobbyist that we. Coordinate with the city manager's. Office and are working towards right now, not actively, because there have been some infrastructure financing bills that have been passed. Recently. But there's something we're kind of watching on an ongoing basis to see if there might be other infrastructure financing tools available to help finance our $600 million. Infrastructure. Tab at Alameda Point. So it's just kind of an ongoing thing, just watching the bills that are going on, making sure we're lending our support, working with our lobbyists, identify ways to possibly improve those those bills and to help. The to help the city. But also mainly the base. Thank you. And I imagine we'd be keeping in close touch with our elected assembly member, whom I have some contacts in. Who's was them? Yeah, I forget his name. Assemblymember Bonta. And then I guess our state senator, too? Absolutely. Especially if there were something very. Immediate, a bill that we're actively. Pursuing, then we would be working very closely with those members. Okay. Well, that sounds good. Thank you for doing that. And I guess. Maybe just just one clarification. The state infrastructure bills that have passed are of no use to us. Correct? I know. Might be a strong word, but there. In practical terms, is that correct? Yes. There's two state infrastructure bills that were passed are effectively of no use to us because they they're impractical to bond against. Correct. Yeah. Well, it's it's the fact that. Before under redevelopment, it would redirect about 80% on average of the 1% tax dollar. Under these bills, it's really just the city's funds, which is about 26%. And so that is you know, that's a lot. And I don't mean to say that that's not. But what. Without that other money and then you have to mitigate the impacts to the general fund, because our basically means is redirecting property tax funds away from. The general fund towards. Infrastructure financing, which may make sense. If you can mitigate it with some other way. But when you mitigate. It, then you're reducing your ability to fund infrastructure through a special tax. So it ends up almost being a wash and not making sense without having that additional tax money from the other taxing entities. Thank you. Mm hmm. So I have a question in regards to the parking lot issues. Will we be asked to approve the budget without addressing the issues in the parking lot? Yes. I mean, I think because you're your parking lot issues. Are looking at your reserves. Right. So your annual budget, what we're asking you to do is approve two years worth of annual budget. Your parking lot issues are sort of below the line. These are all your reserves, which you have and you continue to have. So you can you could do that at any time. You can address those. I mean, I think you should we should address them sooner rather than later. But these parking lot issues don't really affect your budget. However, they could, if you cut something else to fund something in the parking lot issue or not, all the parking lot issues are one time. So, I mean, if you're looking at cutting other things, I mean, hopefully you we would have already had that conversation. Right. I mean, that's what the conversation was. The last time was if you're looking to cut things, that's we asked you to do that last time. The parking lot, really? I mean, we have a laundry list. You know what we were thinking that parking lot was you have a you know, you have. So, for instance, I've asked about looking at part time employees and we haven't had that discussion and that would be ongoing. And I'm not sure how that how we would fund that out of just the reserves. I don't think you would. I think that that would. Oh, you're you're absolutely right. We are not prepared to have that conversation right now about how much it would cost to fund all of our part time employees with full benefits. So I actually didn't say, oh, I've been waiting to have that conversation. And some measure other than just having it parked in the parking lot before and I don't know what other items, there's not a page here that specifies everything that's been in our parking lot, but there may very well be other items on the parking lot that would be considered ongoing. If I. Remember. Along those lines, I think that's a really meaty question that is going to take some staff time to do that analysis. And one of the things that and right now what's before us is trying to pass this two year, two fiscal year budget. We I mean, and that isn't going to be part of it. I just I don't realistically see how it could be, but it's definitely, you know, something you've asked to have looked into. One of the things that I've mentioned to to the interim city manager, when when we've managed and she meets with all of us on a regular basis, is I would like to see sometime after we get past the budget, after our summer recess, our August recess, to have a priority setting workshop for the city council, because I think we all have a lot of great ideas and innovative things we'd like staff to look at. But we and I appreciate that that staff, especially Mr. Modum, are keeping this this running list, this parking lot. But there's also only so many hours in a day and some items might take precedence over others. And that, of course, is a council decision, but a council decision with staff input and I think community input too. So right now I'm content to know that these items are out there on a parking lot. I want to see a site and I, you know, applaud the folks who have worked so hard and all the departments because we saw your presentations over the last couple of months. But I think the next step then moving forward is how are we going to look at this in a course? It can all happen at once. So we'll hopefully we can do this some sort of priority setting process and figure out what will be addressed and when. So can you go over what's in your parking lot? Absolutely. So we have and this is a no. Right? So there's. No. Prioritization things out. There, just things that you have on your list. The all the buildings at Alameda Point. So those are buildings that we know are falling down. And and. I'm not going to address how we think we're going to address it just yet, but I'll just go through the list. Price smoothing. OPEB for an OPEB trust for current retirees. Building maintenance. Emergency water supply. Part time employees going to being fully benefited. I'd say some benefits, some discussion about our part time employees. Okay. Well, we have to have the full information. We can't do we can't just we can't just run the numbers for some employees and not others, an issue that's very near and dear to my heart, which I'm not sure you all agree, but abandoned vessels in the estuary. And then I just heard, you know, staffing and public safety. But obviously that's a much longer conversation. I'm not even sure that belongs in the parking lot, but that's I just took a note on that. So that's what I have in the parking lot right now. I have smaller items that we I'm not putting on the list. For example, the CD-ROMs in the library, we're going to do that. That's not going on a parking lot. Those kinds of things that are sort of small. But that's what I have right now. And if if I've missed something, I'm completely open to adding to it. Vice Mayor. I don't think we ever voted on this. No, that's. Correct. We just heard. Through them out and I caught them. Yeah. And and I think we should probably agenda this, this list for consideration and then have the council give direction out of that and the public can have input into that and also help guide some of the prioritization. But I think to to act on any of those tonight is is not appropriate. But what is appropriate is to have the discussion that Councilmember de SA reminded us of is do we restrict some of the the general fund night as part of this budget, the general fund balance. Right. So and I'd like to advocate for that because I think that some of that money. And you mentioned 14, $15 million. Some of that money should go to things, things, physical things that we have not fixed because we had no money. And that's part of the way we built this this this surplus over the years. I'm not just talking about the last few years. I'm talking about over time. And to look at some of those unfunded issues that we know we're going to have to pay in the future. And I'd like to be to follow council policy and. Have counsel restrict everything over 20%. And then that way we can talk about the parking lot. We can talk about things that we've deferred. And make the investment. And because we have the money now. Those moneys should not be used for operations. And I know it as we're going to go through and manage this budget. It's going to be frugal. And I know the projections are extremely conservative, so I don't think we have an inordinate risk of failing to operate the city by doing so. That's what I'd like to do, but I think we have a couple of speakers I'd like yes, I'd like to hear. Too. Council member Ashcroft. Yeah. I was just going to finish my questions, which and this is the last one on. It's not a letter. All right. We have the disappearing notes. Okay. On the again in the transmittal letter. And there's a discussion that adopting a two year budget saves staff time, which is great, and then it can free up staff for doing other things. And the example was that many jurisdictions use the time saved to develop more robust strategic planning efforts, including additional engagement with the public. And I my question was, I would like to see a more participatory public process next time we do our two year budget. And may I quickly hasten to add that given everything that transpired in an interim city manager taking over for a departing city manager and, you know, and and departing assistant city manager, I think it's very impressive all that's been accomplished. But I know a number of us have seen, for example, some things that the city of Walnut Creek has done, some publications and that were an outgrowth of some workshops. I get that Walnut Creek has more money than we do, I think. But although we heard from them the other night, they still have their challenges. But anyway, my question was, and just something to think about and to get back to is I guess, but how do the interim city manager and finance directors see this. More. Participatory public process happening in the future? So I think it's a great idea. I mean, I think don't forget in there, there was also a transition of finance director. There was indeed, yes. Which is probably more important than city manager or assistant saving, in my opinion. No, I think that's a that's a great point. I think we you know, we can take the show on the road. I would hope that we would have better participation than, let's say, for the performance measures. We don't often get a lot of people very excited about this. Well, but I we are totally open to suggestions. Right. And so as not to reinvent the wheel at a League of California Cities meeting probably a year ago in the fall, almost a year ago now, some of the folks from Walnut Creek who did what they did came and spoke to us about how it was done. And it was I mean, it sounded like it was pretty exciting and engaging. And and I think we can do that here, you know, so it's just, you know, might as well find out what other people did. And and since Walnut Creek is copying us on, you know, some things in their business parts, we can we can learn from them, too, and from other cities as well. Thank you. That's all for me. Thanks. And I'm going to go ahead and call our public speakers, Ken Petersen and then Rob Rato. Mr. Peterson isn't here. All right, Rob Rando. Come on up. And those are the only speakers I have for this item. Okay. Hi, Rob. Writer, executive director of the Park Street Business Association, soon to be the downtown Alameda Business Association. Don't worry, the invitations will someday be in the mail. But that's another issue. Listen, I get to do a fun thing tonight. I get to do something that the five of you do not hear very often? And the rest of the third floor does it here very often. I'm here to commend you. For showing the leadership that you're showing this evening in terms of the two year budget and not requiring cuts in that second year, taking a little bit of that reserve to pay for the. Deficit and then coming back in two years, one year, whenever you're going to start the next two year process and assess it is one of the fun things in my job is I get to speak and talk to a lot of people that are way smarter than I am. I know, Tony, it doesn't take a lot, but that's okay. And most of those people have assured me and have the opinion that. This town's doing pretty darn well now. And I think that at the end of your 1516 budget, you're going to see a significant jump in your income. And we understand you would be silly and you would not be doing the job you should be doing if you made that kind of projection at this point. But we think that at the end of that first year alone, you're going to see a significant increase in the revenue. And certainly at the end of 1617, you're going to see even a bigger jump. And then the council can then and staff can then make the appropriate adjustments in the next two year budget. So God bless you and you're doing a good job. Okay. And thank you very much, because God knows you guys get enough hammering, you know, in the in the in those wonderful newspapers of ours and those blogs. And, you know, everything on the blog is true. It's got to be because it's on the blog. Right. Which leads me to one thing off the item, because I've now thank you and God bless you and keep up the good work. Mr. Horn does not me need me to defend him because he needs no defending, but I'm going to support him because some of us went through a process about ten years ago for that building over on Central Avenue, and some of the things that we got called on the blogs and in that, you know, and in the in the papers. And I just hope and I know all of you folks and I know most of these folks because it's mostly staff sitting behind me. You know, they're the blogs and everybody's happy. You know, everybody's got a nose and an opinion, even if it's right. And I have been working with Mr. Horn since back in the library days and him dealing with poor Dwayne Watson because he broke one of his windows and he has done an exemplary job for this city. And, you know, again, people are certainly entitled to their opinion, but as Councilmember Ashcraft said, there's no reason to get nasty about it. So thank you all. Thank you all the staff for making a two year budget that's going to work for the city. And let's get some more revenue going. Thank you. In the other, we don't have any other speaker slips. Any other comments from Council member de Sok? Oh, yeah. Thank you very much. I think, you know, we've gone through a lengthy budget process. It was very informative. I know all the public was gripped by the information that was presented and are very excited about how we're moving our city forward. I appreciate the work of all the department heads and their assistants, but also I want to especially say thank you to Finance Director Mas Adair for her job, especially coming so recently to the city of Alameda. So thank you very much. I also thank you very much to the interim city manager and the previous city manager and his team. John Russo, interim city manager as well as former Denver for getting us here. You know, when we went through our issues on how to close a 1.4 they the $1.3 million so deficit city staff came up with the 1.4% across the board cuts. And as a council, we raised concerns and how might we address it? I appreciate that staff looked into it and figured out, okay, we can figure, we can deal with maintaining the fires. The ambulance service on Harbor Bay Bay Farm. I think that's important. But for me, more importantly is figuring out a way to maintain the resource officers that our police a largely because you know residents advocated for that while we can't we're not Santa Claus and we can't promise everything. It says something when people take the time to come out to meetings like the budget meetings, or when people take the time to write, you know, thoughtful pieces in our local newspapers about the importance of. And so to the extent that we able to reasonably accommodate those needs, I hope it shows that this city hall is one with its doors wide open on all issues, including the budget. So so I am happy with the budget process that we went through. I think we all know that, that where we have a structural deficit, I don't think we're on our every day jumping up and down and saying we've got a, you know, 30% fund balance. You know, we're so far ahead of, you know, what our policy is. I think we're we're reasonable in our assessment of how to treat that. So but I think as as as citizen Rob Boratto had indicated, you know, we are making some reasonable buy downs into the general fund balance to pay to close that the gap that is warming em had identified previously so that we can continue to have the swimming pool maintenance people so we can continue to have the ambulance service operating so we can continue to have the resource officers, among other things. But all this means, though, is that on the revenue side of things, we're going to continue to have to be, you know, proactive to to grow more revenue so that we can shrink that structural deficit that we all know that's there. So let me say this much, though, because one of the questions that interim city manager Wareham Adam had raised is the possibility of pursuing the utility user tax. You know, as part of this budget process, one of the things I really wanted to stress in from my perspective is having a budget that's there for for youth and and the seniors of the town. And to me, that's why it's important of the Parks and Rec budget. And, you know, I think there is some good news. I mean, the proposed budget for Parks and Rec for the year. While 13 the All Funds Park and Rec budget was $1.3 million. Now, I don't kind of like the all funds budget because I think there is also the there's also some golf money in there. So I kind of controlled it and so I took out the golf money. So if you look at the all all funds, park and rec without the golf assets, you had $6.4 million that was proposed. And and to 1213. So four years later now three years later, we're looking at $7.1 million for the All Funds Park and Rec, excluding golf for 15, 16 and 7.1 again for 1617. So over a four year period, you're looking at a growth of of $700,000 in the park and rec funds, which it represents over that time period of 10.4% increase. Now to me, that's good news as it means that we're trending in the right direction. But I also want to raise that because in looking at each of the what I did was I looked at the the proposed budgets for 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, and the proposed budgets for 15, 16, 16, 17. Well, the budget that we have before us, in looking at each of the budgets, you know what you see when you look at the rate of growth for public safety. And let me be clear for it, the chief of our chief and the police chief and also the men and women who work for him. You know, what you guys do, obviously, is is so critical to our city or our well-being. But the reality, though, is that the rate of growth over that same four year period, it was 20.6% for public safety combined. So that's double the rate of growth of of Parks and Rec, excluding golf courses. By the way, you don't want to include golf courses because if you included golf courses, actually the numbers go down. So. So anyways, you know. So the point, though, is there. So if we're going to pursue the utility user tax as one way to to achieve a more structural to to to move towards a more structural budget. I'm not saying that, you know, we're going to specify what the utility user tax is right now. But I would say, though, that, you know. Ah, for me too. To support a utility user tax. That's not. Ending towards. Youth or even our libraries. Because the fact of the matter is, and I mean this with all respect, the public safety is well taken care of. But our Parks and Rec budget, while it is growing, it is good. I mean, the rate of growth could could be better. So that's my my response to you on the leap. Now, what that means, though, is that if we have a targeted utility, that actually means gets a 66% threshold. Okay, I get it. But I think the public get that, too. So let me end by saying this. I think staff has done a yeoman's job in terms of putting together the budget, educating the public on the issues, getting out information, addressing the questions and concerns raised by council members. And and we know that we still have a lot more challenges ahead of us. But I think we're we're we're heading in with the wind behind us as opposed to the headwinds against us. And Brody. Think you met Amir? I had. Question. And then I kind of wanted to go into my remarks if that works for everyone. So through the chair to the Vice Mayor, what was what is your proposal on restricting the fund balance? And we have a little more discussion on that or. Did you have, like a number in mind or. A 20%. It is that with your motion? So what does that really mean? Would that money be set aside and some other fund know? So what that does is you have an available fund balance and then you have restricted fund balance and your ability fund balance is what you have seen here. So in 1415, you're available ending available fund balances close to $30 million. And what what Vice Mayor Maharishi is saying is that he wants to say any amount that is above the 20% reserve would become restricted, and that's restricted in the general fund. So all that really means is it's not. It means that we would have to come back any time we wanted to spend it and any time we want to spend money, any way we have to come back. But this is just another layer of of control that it's restricted. And if we wanted to spend it, we'd have to come back and actually designate, you know, what we would be using that money for. Very similar to the money that was used seed the. Absolutely. Exactly. We did it. At $3 million. Doesn't is general fund restricted that's on top of the 29 million that we're starting this budget with, correct? That's right. Mm hmm. Did you want. Yes. I just wanted to add, though, the $3 million was restricted for a specific purpose. So when you were actually considering restricting this additional funds above the 20%. If you just say, Well, I just want to restricted without really specifying it for anything else, it's almost like, well, it's available because you're going to spend it on whatever you're going to say. You're going to spend it eventually. You didn't really actually restricted to anything. You know what I mean? So you're just saying. Yes. And Ms.. Warmington was right, saying that any time we want to use any of the money out of fund balance, we have to come back to council and ask for ability to use it if it's above and beyond what's already in the budget. So it's not something that the staff can just come in and say, Well, we're just going to take it and go with it. So it has to come back to you anyway. So I just wanted to warn you in terms of saying what we want to restricted, because I don't think we are quite ready yet, from what I'm hearing, to say this is where we want to apply the particular funding and how much. But just by globally saying, well, let's just set it aside, it's just equivalent to it sitting where it is right now. There's no really you're not really placing in your restriction on it. Because I haven't stated. But my my point. Is, we're going to do that. Is your plan to do that today or. That was my plan. Oh, okay. Hmm. I want to do that. Can we have that discussion now, then? I'm ready to try to make other comments that you want to make. I do have other comments, but. I really want to answer. I mean, I was you brought this up. So we're going to go ahead and do our 11:00 motion of any three to go beyond 11:00 and happens to be 1104. We have a motion. Thank you. Better make. Move. Second. All those in favor I. That motion unanimously passes. Thank you. Thank. I mean, through the chair again, I was. I like the idea. I think the minutes show that I was very enthusiastic about the idea. Like the idea. I just want to be clear on what it is that we can do today and what what we have to wait until a future meeting and then, you know what the mechanics are. So we're going to bring this this 29.6 down to a number that equates to 36% and say that that amount of money set aside. And then, I mean, is is your proposal to dedicate that today to something or I can save my comments to later if you want to have this discussion now, if you'd prefer . Just have it. If I what my position is, is that I'd like to have this council consider restricting everything above 20% of the current general fund balance and apply it to those capital. I hate to use the word project, but those capital needs that have been deferred, deferred maintenance on parks, on buildings, on streets, on sidewalks. On our sewer system. Or to fund other capital assets. And I'm thinking the biggest example is the oft discussed saltwater pumps. These are nonoperational. Expenditures, only capital expenditures. So. Mary Church Member Ashcraft. I think those are all worthy ideas to consider, but not tonight because I feel like we're. So I'm just looking at. What was noticed in were approving and adopting the operating and capital budget for fiscal the next two fiscal years. I would like some input from staff. I know we heard when we had the presentation, I think at the last meeting about the consultant the public works has retained to look at all of our properties and come back to us with a report on a triage list, if you will, and, you know, with direction on what to address first. I mean, I would I would love to step up addressing that. I think the pumps are something interesting to consider. I'm also mindful of the fact that in at least one neighboring jurisdiction, Berkeley, they did that by a vote of the public because it's pretty sizable. I, I don't feel that I would be in a position to vote to do something so specific tonight, because I don't think we or the the public have the information to to base an informed decision on that. A member of the SAG. Well, I guess my issue is that I'm not quite getting it, because the whole point of the budget process, including the CHP process, is to identify. And we went through a lengthy process to identify what are our community improvement needs a for it for and how we're going to budget towards it. Now. Parallel to that, we know that we've got this large needs, whether it's for streets, sidewalks or whatever, because of deferred maintenance and how that happens. So let's just say hypothetically, let's just say hypothetically that, you know, we spend $5 million on streets improving our streets this year. And on every year we spend $5 million. Let's say hypothetically, we should be spending $7 million. So really, the delta that we should be doing is $2 million. Well, then why create? An account that that special specifies that were at a park that $2 million a how to treat it if you want to spend it spend it in that year you know, make that budgetary decision or not. The way I look at a budget the. You know, unbalances, you know, is just this thing that that happened because of this, you know, turnover and certain properties. And it's a certain windfall that that we got. And we got several of them to the extent that now it's. $29.6 million. That's a lot of money, but. A portion of that can just it can easily be the next year, you know, $25.8 million or or or something even south of that. I mean, things change really quickly. So I don't know. I just think that the budgeting process that we have in place to deal with current needs as well as long term unfunded needs. That's why we've got the process. And you make the decision, then you don't you don't have to create, you know, this route Rube Goldberg mechanism on accounting certain dollars aside make the decision I think council members were the deciders. So a concern of mine is we have a parking lot and I thought that we were going to be looking at the reserves to fund the parking lot. And not all of those items are capital improvements. And if in fact, that's what we're going to be limited to, because if that's the if that's what I'm hearing, then I have a concern supporting this budget because honestly, I wanted to be able to look at the parking lot items in it. And it sounds like if it's not a capital improvement, we're not going to be looking at it. Well, that's a concern of mine, right? I think I think. It's just a best practice. If you if you have one time money, which arguably this is, although some of it may not be. But I would say majority is you want to spend it on one time things and that's just a best practice. So I mean that's. So the parking lot then there were some items on there, for instance, abandoned vessels and etc.. Would you anticipate that that's a one time item or that's something that happens periodically? It happens periodically, but it's not a it's not a you know, it's I think the the number was $10,000 per, you know, and so it's you know, we were we were thinking about putting aside, let's say, $50,000 a year for the next two years. It's not a lot of money. But just in the event that we have a bat and boats that we want to haul out of the estuary. Okay. And other items were OPEB trust purse smoothing. Those are not capital expenses. Correct. No, no. The OPEB for retirees, though, would could be considered one time. So not necessarily capital, but it could be considered a one time deposit into a trust, for example. And the first smoothing is kind of a hybrid. I mean, we kind of think that that is sort of a it's a discrete. Period of time, it's going to last for you know, it's going to last for five years. I mean, that's what Perse is telling us. So we know that is not going to continue to increase. So that's you know, one could argue that that is one time ish in maybe in nature. So that's not the definition I heard, though, of what to do. Right. Right. Capital needs deferred and other capital assets versus one time, which I think is a different I know it's a different definition, remember. And I think you're right, Mary Spencer. And I think this also perhaps points to the fact that tonight, right now is not the time to decide that. I think what was said earlier applies to all of these proposals. Let's bring them back. They they have not come before the council and the public fully for consideration. Right. The other issue there and thank you for raising it, is the reason. One of the reasons why we need the time to do the analysis is because some of the things that we're talking about, there are other ways that we can fund them. For example, Al made a point, we've already talked with Ms. that about using some of their money to take care of those buildings. If we have other funds to take care of some of these issues, I would highly recommend you not using the general fund money. Streets and sidewalks, for example. Now we may actually do that. However, we just had b b pass. We need to look at that. We need to see how much do we think we're going to actually be getting over time. And is that the best source, you know, best use of those funds? We have not had that opportunity to do that. We need to take a look at that and come back to you and say, you know, these are your parking lot items. This is how we recommend that you fund them and we're not prepared to do that. But some of them could very well be funded from these reserves. Absolutely. Well, absolutely. And and then a motion limiting that could preclude. That could preclude if we're using it for specific. But I think that the point is I think the point is to. Not to put an intention not to use these reserves over and above the 20% for operations. That's the first point. Right. Because we have to at some point, we have to live within our means or day to day operations. We have to look at with our best guess. Our best estimation, I guess, is best estimation of what our day to day revenues are. So I'd like to cut out all of. As much as I can. The the revenues that have been gathered on one time events, and I think that's important to do. And then applying these on a priority basis to I'm not going to say one time expenditures, but those long term capital expenditures that cities do once in a lifetime. And we've deferred a lot of those. And I think that's broad enough to capture this. And if people want to say it's 25% or they'll look at those unfunded liabilities that we have with regard to Purves. And with regard to OPEB. That's a discussion that we can have. But I think we have to separate those things out from what is our operating general fund reserve. And I think the sooner to do that, do we do that, the better. Then we can talk about the specifics of the parking lot issues or the other needs that are on the public works list. The other improvements that we've delayed, city replacement of the pools, graphene fields that are in wretched shape. There's all sorts of things that we need to look at. And the list is long, right? I remember the member de Saag. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So. Listening to the conversation. If we just can say we want to say anything over 20 or 25%, which might be a little more conservative, we're going to set aside and then have a discussion at a later meeting, hopefully soon, and then addressed what we're going to do with that. You know, whether it's, you know, over 25 or whether it's over 20, you know, looking at the at the 1920 projection of 19% reserves, I mean, I'd be more comfortable with a 25 number. But if, you know, the council thinks 20 is good, that's fine, too. But I do think, you know, we re maybe not getting into specifics because again, it hasn't been agenda. But I do think the concept that the vice mayor raised that, you know, we should set aside, you know, X percentage over our what we want to have in reserves and then consider ways to apply that to some of these deferred and long term or one time projects. You know, I think that that's something worth worthwhile. Remember Data. I think the way to the straightest, greatest line between two points approach to this thing is to basically say, okay, let's come up with a strategy with regard to how to treat unfunded unfunded capital improvements. The once you know what your strategy is, then you're going to have policies that are going to from which emanate how you approach that, deal with that. We're kind of doing it backwards. We're kind of saying, okay, we've got this revenue now, let's look for strategies. You know, I think let's understand what our what our wants or needs are and strategize around them and then and then fit the revenue availabilities that way. To me, that's more straightforward way to do it instead of like, okay, on that. So that's, that's my point is this is just, just these different moving parts that seem a little odd to me. It's like, okay, if, like, if it's unfunded liability, unfunded capital improvement projects, then create us. Let's create a strategy of it priorities I low, medium and then you know and then and then and then have policies with regard to the fund balance. Now on balance and then that's fine. You get my point. So for me, we were putting stuff in a parking lot. I was expecting to be able to have a conversation for every item on the parking lot, whether or not it falls under a capital expense, one time expense or whatnot, and it would be funded out of the reserves. So I would not be willing to support it attaching any of these strings, because otherwise, honestly, I don't know. I think then we needed to spend more time on the items in the parking lot if we were going to make a decision at this point not to fund them from the reserves. Remember Ashcroft? Well. I think if I understood member Otis proposal correctly, we're not making any specific decisions one way or the other, but just saying that we're going to set this certain amount, whatever the percentages aside, have that discussion at a later date and with agenda items. The vice mayor noted earlier that, you know, the council hadn't decided on any of the parking lot items and the same could be said for all the suggestions that were that were raised tonight. But but let's do it. And I and can I just throw in that let's give staff just a little tiny breathing room because I think they've been living and breathing budget for I don't know how long, but, you know, months on end now. So I don't expect this to come back. I'm speaking for myself, but please consider this my colleagues that gosh, even before the August recess, because it seems like we've got pretty full agendas coming up. But but, you know, I'd like to hear from staff if you know how, how and when, because I do like a timeline. I don't like things to just be open ended. I will get back to you. But what what do you think is realistic and in what form would you anticipate bringing this back to us more, Madame? Well, I think, you know, we could absolutely do a more thorough job if we could bring it back in the first meeting in September. I know that's a long way away. I think, you know, if you ask us to bring it back at the end of July, it's going to be a much more. Cursory review and maybe not as fleshed out. So I understand there's a balance between you want to you know, you want to get this done quickly and you don't want that money sort of hanging around and, you know, the the temptation to spend it. So, I mean, I think obviously we would prefer the extra time to do the analysis. So it sounds like we're being asked to set aside. I'd like to focus on this one issue before we move on. There was the issue already raised and we've had several speakers, I mean, vice mayor and now member already. If we're setting aside a certain amount, this is a proposal that we would set it aside for certain things such as one time expenses or or just, if I heard correctly. Number two, use that, just set it aside and you open in regards to what percentage? I'm kind of open to the you know, now that I heard Councilmember Discogs suggestion that, you know, maybe we come up with a strategy and if giving you until September, you know, helps that maybe we come up with a strategy on, you know, capital improvements come with the strategy and unfunded liabilities and then, you know, that mean . I think we should at least come up tonight with a number saying, you know, we want to set aside, you know, X dollars above either 20 or 25% as of the end of the school year 1617. And then, you know, we give staff direction to come up, come back with these strategies because, you know, now that I hear that, you know, it does kind of sound like we're putting the cart before the horse. So look at this. And I, you. Know, remember. Okay, hold on just a minute. We had it. Mr. De, you spoke to this and you made your response was, unless you're going to set it aside for something, you don't need to set it aside. Well, I think what you can do this is what I would suggest you do. I would recommend anything above 25%. 25% is one quarter's worth of our expenditures. So what? You just give us direction and say anything. You know, set your 25% target in 16, 17 and anything above that staff come back to us at September and give us your recommendation on how you think what would be the best way of allocating those funds. And, you know, we can give you we can give you our recommendations after looking at all the needs that we have, knowing where the other funding sources are coming from, and provide you with that those suggestions. So why would that need to be done now as opposed to in September when you come back, when you're showing a side? Well, all. You're doing is providing a direction of that. You want to set your reserves at 25%. But I haven't looked at the items yet. So it's an arbitrary number. You're not does have a policy for anything. You currently have a policy of setting your reserves at 20%. That is a council policy that that's what we've always tried to strive for. We in the past couple of years have suggested 25% because of the recession and because 25% is actually a quarter one quarter's worth of expenditures. But when this comes back, we could very well say at higher or lower that we're not committed to that. You're never committed to that. So tonight, really, we're being asked to approve a budget. And I'm I'm not sure that it adds I would defer to Mr. Derrick's comments in regards to unless you're going to set it aside for something specifically. But we're not suggesting you restrict do that. We're not suggesting a restrict it. And that's what. Mr. Harris. Actually, I'm not. So I'm still falling back on that, I believe Member de SAC. I said that we don't need to set aside a percentage at this point. Today we were being asked to approve a budget. When it comes back, we could set aside money for something if we desire, but that we're not. Well, I. Think we need to do that. I think you want to have reserves set at a certain level. That is good practice. You don't want to just say, well, whatever it is you want to. Have tonight, we're being asked to approve a certain budget that has reserves there. That's what the question in front of us is, is not to spend all these moneys. And we're not planning on doing that. There's sort of a two step process. We're asking you to approve the budget, as is what we have presented to you. And if you want, you can do that and then we can have this conversation afterwards. Right. So we're asking you to approve this budget, as is the way it's proposed. And then after that, we're asking you to give us direction to come back and say, okay, right now in 14 or 16, 17, you have 38% in reserves and back staff. And tell us, if we allowed you to go down to 25%, how would you spend that money? So that's not actually the conversation I was thinking we were going to have. I thought at some point we were going to be looking at the parking lot, going over all the items, and then we can decide what we want to do moving forward. And and at some point we will. But the point just isn't tonight. And I would I would suggest I think we're moving cautiously. I like the 25% number. Council policy has been a 20% reserve, 25 shows that were being a little more conservative, a little more cautious. It's always good to set aside more rather than less. But there's a delta between, you know, the actual reserves that we have in that 25%. And I want to make sure that whatever is taken away with the list of the items to come back to the council, that we make sure that we address all the items the mayor is concerned about, that that comes back before the council, all the items the vice mayor is concerned about. And and everyone, we have a list. Right. So. So in. Its entirety. But and I think I think we would be acting prudently and responsibly and and then having a fuller discussion. And I also favor the beginning of September, because you stop and think about it, to rush this before the end of July, and then we go on August break. What's you know, what's the point? And let's give staff a little well-needed break as well. But anyway, that's what I think we accomplish. Everything. Yeah. One other comment. Excuse me. We did this November. I don't know if you recall, but we did this very exact same exercise in November with the prior council. We had a surplus of $11.5 million. And this is exactly what we did with them. We brought we said, here are the areas that we think that you should put these funds. We funded the equipment replacement fund. We funded technology services, compensated absences, workers comp insurance. We designated different places where we thought this money should go. So we've done this before. It's it's a prudent method. I think it's separate and aside from the budget. And I think, as Councilman Councilmember Ashcraft said, we can absolutely come back with all these items for you in September. But at this point, could we have a motion to approve the budget as. The two approve the budget and then we to give direction subsequently. Well, I'd like to move to approve the budget. That's recommendation. Right. Do we have a second? I'd second most likely to have my comment time. Richard like to make your comments. I second that so. Okay, Beth, I said you want to make some comments? Anyone else want to do. Thank you, Madam Chair. I also want to thank staff for all the hard work in putting this together, and I want to thank my colleagues for the discussions. I mean, they've been very enlightening and educational, and I appreciate everyone's thoughtfulness in discussing the budget. It's a two year budget. You know, I look at the budget. You know, we've done a couple of things which I think are important. You know, we started to address some of our maintenance. Our deferred maintenance started to address some of our long term liabilities. We've showed restraint, you know, and we've also started to restore, you know, some of the cuts that that we've had to suffer through in the last few years in the Great Recession. You know, I think when you look at a budget, it reflects your values, your values as a city. And I think as I vote for one, I want to make sure that it's a budget that reflects my values. And I see many things that do reflect my values. First, I just want to point out the growth in the public safety. You know, if you look at that, I think that's most entirely attributable to the smoothing and the increase in the purse costs. So, you know, nobody's, you know, making out or, you know, getting huge, you know, sources of money. You know, this is something that the state is forcing us to do and we really don't have much of a choice in it. So when we talk about the growth in public safety, let's keep that in mind. But, you know, also the person warning is out there and that is an issue we have to address long term and apparently now even longer than the five years that we anticipated. So that's something I want to keep on the parking lot and make sure we we pay attention to. But if you look at the budget overall, you know what we're doing, we're doing a budget for two years and we're balancing that budget for two years. I think that's a strong value to have. You know, we we began this year to address OPM, and I think doing that is a strong value to have. You know, we started we have money in there for Estuary Park and Jean Sweeney, open space. You know, taking care of expanding our parks is a good value to have. And we haven't cut services, you know, after the last four years to have a budget that has no cuts to services. I think that's a strong value to have. We have no cuts to public safety. So everything we do, you know, all of the values of our property, the strength of our businesses, you know, it comes down to having safe streets knowing that the police department is out there protecting our citizens and protecting our residents and our businesses properties, and that if if there is a fire or a natural disaster, an emergency, that our fire department will be right there to respond. And I think having a budget that has no cuts to public safety services, you know, that reflects my values and I think it reflects the values of of most Alameda. Now, we the staff has listened to the council and, you know, the whole discussion of one time revenues and excluding them. You know, that's a discussion we have to, you know, keep keep on going and keep going forward on. And I think that reflects our values. We've added to the library, we're adding materials to the library. We're adding hours to the library. Now, that reflects my values, and I think that reflects the values of the city. And the last two things, you know, we've restored the drastic cuts that we had to our to our IT department . And now that department can kind of catch up and we can actually be in the 21st century as far as our i.t. And I think that's critical. And we've been also prudent and judicious in the other positions that we're adding. You know, we're adding in public works and parks, base reuse, economic development. You know, we're not having a huge expansion of payroll. I think it's prudent, it's judicious, and this is where we need to do so. Again, the budget reflects our values. It reflects my values. I think it reflects the values of of the mass populace in Alameda. And I'm I'm honored to cast a vote for this budget in my my first budget approval. All right. Any other comments from the council? We have a motion to approve the budget in the second. And Raqqa. And then are we we're going to come back with consideration of what, if anything, to do on Iraq. Then there's also another budget on here we're being asked to write letters to. All right. So. I plan to support this budget. I did not support the public safety contract of the that was approved 3 to 2 by this board. When I look at the budget, I see some departments that have been seriously left behind over years. For instance, I.T., I think that this is a step into correcting other departments that have truly been left behind. And our community depends upon all of these departments. My opinion, public safety is still 70%. It's a very important part of our community. I did support the emergency operation center. I supported the new fire station. Those to me go to the safety of our community. I do want to look at staffing at some point. I am concerned about the overtime. I think that that will be addressed by filling some of these vacancies, which I think is very important, not only because then we know. What. We're, but the money is being spent on and not want to control overtime. That's an extra expense. It also goes to protecting our police officers and firefighters in regards to the number of hours that they are out there working. I think regular hours as opposed to overtime is important. And we did hear some of that earlier in regards to funding our library, things like that. The parks of that is critical. So I see this as a step in the right direction to serving the city at large, which is why I am able to support. I see this as a good compromise, but the corrects. Some of these departments have been left behind. All right. So no other comments. Of advice. There. I just want to say a couple of things. One is that I intend to support this this budget. But I also want to address a I think in an inflated general fund reserve. And I'm looking forward to that conversation of I think we've put a cap on the addition of head count, particularly where it's very needed . Although I still am wary of hiring project managers, I think they are a cost of the project. And I'd like to be very conservative to that, but I don't see support for that approach. And that is a city a city management function. I think we've had I want to emphasize that we've had years of deferred maintenance, and I'm looking at allocating one time funds to that purpose. And we cannot live on one time funds to our operation. And most of those, most of the reserves that we've built up have been on one time revenue sources. I'm really looking forward to that part of the conversation. Amber Ashcraft. So I was under the impression that the vice mayor was going to bring a motion after we voted on the budget that I was prepared to support. So. Okay. So it sounded like you were kind of saying that the the opportunity had passed. And I don't think it has at all. And I want to thank staff and the community for attending all these meetings, stepping up, really educating us, asking good questions and being part of the conversation. I really think it was a very informative budget process. All those in favor. I. Oppose abstentions passes unanimously. Thank you. Now we have. Thank you. We have another budget we're being asked to approve tonight. Do you want to separate it? We approved this other budget and so. I'd like to do the CIC. It's real quick, I think. But why don't we stay with what's related to the budget we just passed? Now they've heard enough. We leave. This then. Then I'd like to. To make a motion just to start this discussion. They'll say this just to. Yes. Form the discussion. Hearing what I heard and what my intent is, I'd like to recommend that. The City Council gives direction to the city manager to. Provide us with a strategy that involves. Allocating money in excess of 25%. Of the current general fund. Balance this year or in 17 this year. To items that fall under nonoperational activities. I think that's general enough. To. Oh accommodate most of the items in the parking lot. And those items that are operational or parking I think are a budget item, a general fund budget or a fund budget discussion. And should not be carried on either one time revenues or non project related revenues. Okay. So is there a second. Way that was just staff direction listening because that was the emotion. Was that emotion? I thought it was emotional, very restraint. And to say the word direct staff. But all the all the observations about what was and wasn't. Operational or one time items. I mean. So he's not speaking to them. We don't need a motion. But if there's general consensus on that, I mean, I have it here. But okay. So this means that we won't be looking at the whole parking lot. We will only be looking at certain items. I am planning on bringing. Back that direction. No, I know. But I would add that to staff direction. It could be a hybrid. Yeah. I mean, I think I think. To find funding sources, it might not be. Exactly. And I think. Frankly, the issue about the part time is an ongoing issue. And I think that's something that it's a longer discussion. This discussion on this on the one time is a much easier discussion because it's one time and we can identify them and the discussion on the benefits for part time. Right. I absolutely plan on bringing that back to you. But that's a more. That's a more. Difficult conversation. Staffing and staffing. Yes, that's another issue, too. And I think we need to have that conversation to see if that's something we want to direct you to do. Yeah. And and and if there what the details of our and I'm I think that's our parking lot discussion go through each item have that but again to reiterate to reiterate the direction I'd like to say see is that 25%. Anything in excess of 25%. We have you come back to us to address. That fund to one time expenditures. And the rationale is because they were largely gathered on one time revenues. And we can't operate on that surplus. Okay. I think we're in trouble. Member. Did you want to become a member of SAG? Well, the problem, though, I mean, the mechanics of it, of course, will be will be ironed out by our city staff. But let's be clear about something. Our fund balance is $29.6 million, roughly out of $81 million $80 million budget off of our $29.6 million fund badge fund balance. 25% would be 19.9%, and the remainder would be $9.7 million. So there's two issues here. One is that and of course, you know, the details and the mechanics would be would be worked out. But it's because there's a certain murkiness that that leads me to think I can't support this. For now is that, you know, I think there's a certain hubris that, oh, we can always keep a $19.9 million, because that's what we're basically saying going forward. We're going to have a general fund balance of 25%, that that amounts to $19.9 million. Or maybe it goes up because, you know, our overall budget goes up and down and that we're going to lock in the the remainder, which is 9.7 million. We're going to lock that into some kind of one time ballot of funds. Well, I don't know. You never know. I mean, things can happen such that, you know, maybe you have to dip into that that $19.9 million, that 25%. And then if you dip into that 25%, does that mean that. Well, that other $9.7 million, the 12.1%, that that that's frozen now, that's a separate account. So I think the mechanics of this are kind of like unknown. So in the second point that I want to get at is that in building up the $29.6 million fund balance, it just didn't just happen because of one time revenues where in time revenues happened. But it also happened because, you know, staff made some decisions with regard to our employee base and how much we set aside for that. So I still think which leads me to believe that rather than chasing the money and figuring out how to spend it, we have to come up with what is our strategy, what are our needs and wants, and how to strategize around that and then figure out spending. I think that's that's the way the appropriate way to go about it instead of looking at it from the money side and figure and without recognizing that the money side, you know, for a variety of reasons, we can say 25% all we want, but it's going to go up and down and up and down. So I don't know. I at this point, to me, it's I think this is too substantive an issue to you not have a very detailed discussion and variety. I think you've had a mayor. I think what we're trying to say here is. We have this surplus, are we going to let it sit there and use it to. Absorb the operating deficits that are projected out in the next five years, which I think the vice mayor has made clear he thinks is not an appropriate use . And, you know, I kind of agree with him on that one, or if we're going to say let's set a policy that we're going to have a reserve of 25%, and then we take that excess and we address some of these things that we haven't addressed or like OPEB that we we need to address. I mean, I think maybe the city manager may have said that the most eloquently right before we did the motion is that, you know, we say come back with these strategies on, you know, what our options are and maybe. Or Councilmember de Saag. One of those options is doing nothing and leaving it in there, you know, and keeping it there and using it for something like. And taking care of deficits. I'm not inclined to do that at this point. But maybe that's an option that, you know, maybe has three votes. That we could do. But, you know, my only concern about the way that the current direction is, is I think that 25 should be as of the end of 1617 since we did a two year budget and not not 1516 but. First year of our deficit. Second budget. And we've already taken we've already taken 1.2 million of that surplus. We're already started chipping away at the fund balance. And that concerns me. And the only reason that I'm not concerned enough to vote against this budget, because I think the Delta is so small that it's in and the projections are of revenue, are so conservative that when we come to the end of this first mid term and the end of the first year of this year budget, we're going to see that we're in better shape than our projections had originally anticipated. And that's I see the all the buildings that are coming out of the ground right now are going to add to the property tax role where they're not now and they're going to add to the transfer tax. So we're going to see a big, big bump in those two. And our projections are much more conservative. I think what's actually going to happen just based on the number of housing units that are being built right now. So I think we have a margin of error that we can work with there. But I think if we if we don't keep the pressure on ourselves, temptation is to spend that money down and to not just not spent, not just to spend the money down, but also to continue deferring maintenance on things that have been wanting for years. Anybody drive down Eagle Avenue over there lately? The street is falling apart. If you look at the Veterans Memorial Building. Veterans Memorial Building is in sorry shape. So it's out on the parking lot? No, no, I'm not. I'm just using those examples. But that's so I'm not going to throw stuff into the parking lot, but I just say it. But that's an example. But I think that's what has. Been deserve deferred for years because we've had no money. We got the Carnegie Building across the street and it's kind of it should be a museum. And we're trying to get some private nonprofit to fund the rest of the rehab in there. And we could do that with this. I mean, there's. Bob Hohn has the list. So the strategy is to allocate the money. That's the strategy. And then the mechanics of of spending the money is, is evaluating the list and picking it. But that's not what you said. I was the one who came to us. That's exactly what. We've got to have the strategy first. You've got to have your priorities first. Then you figure out. Money member. ASHCROFT So I've honestly lost track of whether we had you made a motion. You did make a motion. And and I support it and. Lack of it. You didn't give us a chance to second it. We're still talking. Don't get impatient there. I, I actually do support the motion, and I would second it, and here's why. There is a cost to deferring maintenance. And we you know, we want to be smart with our money. I think there is. I don't see the harm of having staff come back with a list of what we might do with this, you know, amount above a 25% reserve. We can always decide yay or nay at that point, but let's let's at least give staff the opportunity to delve into all of the things we've we've put out there tonight. And we'll we'll have a chance to look it over. We'll have a chance to give more input. But I think it is a smart use of our money. I don't disagree with with Councilmember Desert that we need to always have that rainy day fund. But I think we're doing that. But I think we can at least take the next step and see what would it look like, what would it count, what would it cost? And we can make our make our decisions about allocating the funds or not when it comes back to us. But I certainly think it's productive to to have the opportunity for council and the public to take a look at what staff comes up with. So with that, I second your motion. So can you clarify, are you looking at everything on the parking lot or only certain things? Okay, so repeat what you said that you're willing to look at. Non-operational was the only restriction. But that's a restriction. So your second is to then? Well, it is to keep it neat and clean. But I also believe that I have heard the interim city manager take our direction that and I've heard her acknowledge more than once this evening that she will also come back to us with the items on the parking lot. But they will not necessarily come out of the surplus because some of them might have other funding sources, and it still has to be a council decision. All of this does what's going to be just because we throw out what our favorite projects are, it doesn't mean it's by acclimation. So yes, parking lot will come back. But for the purposes of this motion, I'm seconding the motion that was said. That that's to fund non-operational expenditures. All right. So we have a motion on second any other discussion? I like the concept on just the restrictions of the motion. I'm really not that comfortable with and I'd feel better if we didn't restrict the no didn't restricted to just non one time things and you know we consider the idea that we use it for operations maybe we'll reject that. I mean I'm not in favor of that, but I think it should be discussed and that, you know, we look at everything on the parking lot and that, you know, I think that this does a couple of things off that are important to some of us on the board. So so I won't be able to support it. I think it's contrary to actually all of our budget discussions where we had a parking lot. If we were going to restrict it, then we should have had the discussion as we went through the process. Well, I'm also going to vote no, but I'm going to vote no for a very simple reason. The whole point of the month long budgeting process was to identify what our long term unfunded capital needs. We all know that. I mean, we we were part of the that that poll report that came out in 2010, and we've always talked about it. So to suddenly say, well, now we got to create this policy to begin to treat these unfunded capital projects. Hey, I don't mind about that. But you know what I think? I think the straightforward thing would have been to say, okay, we got to pay. We got to spend more on capital improvement projects for the budget that we just voted on, but we didn't. To me, that's just the simple, straightforward thing is understand what your needs and wants are. And then and accordingly, particularly with regard to, you know, the unfunded capital expenditures. So do we need to vote on that? There is three. Go ahead, Mavrodi. I'm sorry. You may remember. Thank you. I mean, are you open to modifying the motion to, you know, not be as restrictive? And that might satisfy. So I wonder. Whether saw hunger. So at this point I anticipated that the next step would become the timeline that. City manager shared. Come August or September, the staff would come back. We'd look at the parking lot, start developing strategies, or see what can be funded different ways. And then I think at that time we can start deciding where, well, we have this budget. Well, we do have a motion on the table. And I think the question it was just around. And I already had expressed concerns. But I think the question was just asked about willingness to modify in some way. You were asking the vice mayor, were you? Yeah. And I was trying to answer that in regards to what I think is how how we were discussing it. Which is kind of where. I am from. I don't want. To tell. You out. I want to hear what I mean. I want to vote no on this because I think it's a good thing to do. But I just don't like the restrictions. And if if we could. Just if I modify the motion to take the restrictions off. And just say we're going to have a 25%. Have staff come back at half. Staff, come back with the recommendations on what to do with the amount over 25%. Yes, I would be. I would be. Then I will make that modification just to keep this. And it's 15, 15, 16, right. Well, yes, because I'm going to hang on that one, because we're starting that slide to deficit projection. I'll give on that one. Okay. We got it. Okay. Okay. So you gave a little. I'll give a little. So there's emotion. Are you second unit? Then she. Started. Checking in with the modification. Modification? I will. All right. Any other discussion? So I will not support this. I don't think it's appropriate. I think that we will always have that opportunity and I think it loccisano unnecessarily. And I would actually say contrary to advice, yes, it no, we're we're choosing a number. We're choosing a number that I don't think is appropriate that is actually contrary to direction from this idea that you don't need to choose a number unless you do have something that you want to restrict, which we don't have here. So I won't be able to support it. Any other comments? All those in favor. I oppose. I oppose. Motion carries 3 to 2 if I have it correct. You're a. All right. One. So we have another budget to approve S.A.C.. It's a resolution on here. We have. There's no report. That's essentially just a second. Any discussion? Constat. So it's my understanding that this is. Just something that we need to do. That's right. It's just another it's another body that you sit as that body. So you're just approving essentially the same thing you just approved before. That's correct. You're just essentially approving just the successor agency's budget just because it's an an entity, separate entity will have to approve a separate resolution for it. Thank you. All right. Any other comments? All those in favor. I. Oppose. Abstentions passes unanimously. Thank you. All right. And at this time, I believe it's appropriate we can now adjourn. No items for B, B.

So this is Port of Seattle property. Going back before my time on the council. There used to be public right away in certain portions of that that long ago went through the street vacation process with a clerk filed to grant conceptual approval for that. Those right away have effectively been vacated and turned over to the port, and that has allowed the expansion of Terminal 18 more upland storage areas for containers and other additions to the facility. However, we have not finalized this because there was ongoing agreements specifically around easements for where utility facilities that previously were in or in what was previously a right away but were now on private property and how they move forward. And for a variety of reasons, it's taken over a decade to resolve those issues. They are now resolved. So this is the final action to close out that vacation process so that we have it off our plates. Nothing else is going to change further out there.

Read for the first time and laid over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading District eight. Thank you, Mr. West. Thank you. Members of the City Council. The staff report was given by Linda Tatum. Good evening. Vice Mayor Richardson and members of the city council staff is here this afternoon to present a zoning code amendment that is was requested by city council. And I'd like to provide a brief recommendation and staff presentation and some of the recommendations that came out of this effort. This area is for the area of the city that is zoned r one. L This is generally known as the Virginia Country Club area of the city, or Los Cerritos, depending on who you talk to. This area is very unique in the city in that it is the only area in the city that is zoned r one IL and there are 6647 properties in this area. And the area is generally bound by country club, country club drive on the north and on the west, and there are a couple of discontinuous parcels in that neighborhood. The first one is the area that I'm pointing to here. If you could see the red dot, that area is just directly north of the Virginia. I'm sorry, the lower cerritos. The lower cerritos. The loss of real property. That area is discontinuous from the rest of the property and then on the north and east of the property, it's called Country Club Lane. If you could see that area there, that area is off of Long Beach Boulevard. So included in that 647 properties are all of these properties. And this area is very unique, as I mentioned earlier, as it's the only area in the city that zoned r one ill. And this area was very specifically designated as a unique area for the purpose, because it it does have the very the most largest lots in the city. And it's also designated in the zoning code specifically for large lot and large estate homes. It was designated that way in the city's general plan. And that's clearly the intent of this area to have the very expansive an estate type homes. Just to give you a few facts and figures about this area, the area the approximate lot size in this area or the average lot size of those 647 is approximately one 1100 square feet I'm sorry, 11,000 square feet. That's the average lot size in the area. However, within that area, the the lot size is very everything from as small as 8000 all the way up to more than 30,000 square feet. So you can see it's quite a range of lot sizes that are encompassed within the neighborhood. And likewise there's a large variety of home sizes in the neighborhood and that varies. Everything from less than 2000 square feet all the way up to the largest home in the neighborhood is approximately it's just over 8000 square feet. So we talked a little bit about the unique character of the neighborhood and how it's designated in the zoning code specifically for large lot in a state properties. Just to give you a little bit of history on this, back in September of 2015, the city council adopted a moratorium for this area, and that moratorium was in response to a a request by the neighborhood to have the city staff look at the zoning and development standards for the area, specifically as they relate it to neighborhood character. And that included issues or concerns regarding the sizes of the homes, the setbacks and other development standards that are currently in the city's zoning code. That moratorium limited development in the neighborhood to no more than 1500 square feet until such time as the City Council could act on recommendations for potential changes to the zoning development standards from the city staff and the City Planning Commission. In August of 2016, the City Council extended that moratorium in order to allow staff additional time to work with the community residents. So I'd just like to briefly go over this timeline. During that period, the staff was engaged in extensive outreach with the neighborhood. That outreach included a number of meetings with the Low Cerritos Preservation Committee in the neighborhood, and we also had a series of public meetings. And during those public meetings, we had the first of those public meetings was in September of 2016, when staff essentially had a listening session to hear for the first time in a broad community settings, some of the concerns from the neighbors. And the second meeting that we had was in November of 2016. And the purpose of that meeting was to provide preliminary recommendations about the zoning code standards that staff recommended would be changed. We followed that up again in December with a study session with the city's planning commission. The initial proposed amendments were presented to the Planning Commission in a study session, and we followed that up with a public hearing before the Planning Commission in February of 2017. And there was a second planning commission public hearing in February of 2016. I'd just like to point out that during this entire period of time, staff did extensive research. We looked at other cities and development standards and other single family neighborhoods and other cities around the state and within the Los Angeles region. And we also communicated directly with members of the neighborhood and took feedback from the neighborhood. And those recommendations, based upon that extensive research in the regarding what's the existing conditions in the neighborhood, the homes sizes, the lot sizes, the potential impacts. We also brought in a an architect to to consult with us, to assist us in developing those standards. And the result of that is a series of recommendations that I'd like to walk through. Before I do that, though, I'd like to acknowledge that staff worked really hard, hard on this effort for the last year. And that team of staff was myself, including Mark Hungerford, who was the lead planner on this effort, and our current planning officer, who was Carrie Tai. And with that, I'd like to walk you through the recommendations that staff came up with. The first of those recommendations is a proposal to modify this, the front yard setback. And this graphic here shows you the orange, if you can. I don't know if you can see it clearly, but there's a difference. You can see in the existing front yard, setback has 20 feet, meaning the house has to be set back from the public, right where the sidewalk at least 20 feet staff's recommendation was that a 25 feet was to modify that to increase the setback by five feet. And this recommendation was strongly supported by the neighborhood. We did get some other opinions from the neighborhood, but this is the recommendation we settled on. And I just tell you, one of the other unique things about the low Cerritos neighborhood is the fact that this neighborhood uniquely has what we call special setbacks. So when we're saying modify the setback from 20 to 25 feet, that acknowledges that in some areas and on some streets in that particular neighborhood, they have a special setback that could be as large as a minimum of 20 and it can go all the way to 50 feet. So in this case, we're recommending that there be a minimum setback of 20, 25 feet for the front yard. The second recommendation that came out of our effort was a proposed side yard setback, and that side yard setback is currently at six feet. So that means on either side of your building, on the side property line, the minimum requirement is six feet. Staff's recommendation was bifurcated or broken into two parts four lots that were less than 60 feet. The recommendation was to maintain that that 60 feet. However, for lots that were greater than that had a larger street frontage than 60 feet, that that side yard set back be a minimum of ten feet or 15% of the lot with and that the idea there was to give greater privacy between between lots that had a a lot directly adjacent to them. So that is staff's proposal for the side yard setback. One other component of the side yard setback is we realize that on corner lots were lots that faced or street there was a need or there was a strong recommendation from the community that that on the street corners that there be a greater setback. And after looking at this again in some detail, the recommendation from staff was that on the corner setbacks, that that setback be increased to ten feet. And that's what you're seeing here in this slide. The orange, again, represents the increased setback and you can see it in a corner configuration here on the top, oops. On the top is a corner lot configuration. And on the bottom you can see when you have a front yard setback on a diagonal street such as San Antonio in the lower Cerritos community. Lastly, a lot of discussion was provided regarding the topic of floor area ratio. The floor area ratio is the mathematical relationship between the area of the dwelling and the size of the lot. Essentially what that does is is govern or to assure that there is some proportionality between the size of the unit and the size of the lot. The current floor area ratio in the city's standard across the entirety of the r1l zoning district is 8.6, which essentially means that you multiply by 0.6 the size of the lot. For example, if you had a 10,000 square foot lot at a point six FSR, you could build a 6000 square foot unit. So the current FFR recommended or the current FFR in the zoning code is point six. And staff's recommendation is that the are increase or decrease to be smaller to allow a smaller unit into that that go down to a point five. And again we bifurcated that so that four lots that were less than 15,000 square foot, they would have a 0.5 ratio. Again, to use the example, if your lot is a 10,000 square foot lot, the point five would reduce the size, the maximum size of the home to 8.5, which is a 5000 square foot home size. And what you can see here is generally within the neighborhood, we've calculated that the current average affair in the neighborhood is a point three for lot sizes, 0 to 15000. And the highest that exists out there today is a point seven within this lot size range. The second part of the FBR recommendation is for lots that are greater than 15,000 square feet. And in the neighborhood, there are 94 properties that are greater than 15,000 square feet. And that current air I talked about earlier is a point six. And the recommendation here is that the FAA, RB decreased to a point four. And again, just some facts and figures related to what's currently existing on the ground. The current FAA are in the neighborhood as a point to two. And the highest, if they are in the neighborhood, is a .43. That just gives you an idea of what's currently on the ground in the neighborhood. The last recommendation from staff was regarding the lot size. There was a lot of concern in the neighborhood that because a lot sizes are quite large related to other lots in the in the city. But not more importantly that if two large lots were merged, you could conceivably have a lot in the middle of the block that was completely out of scale and out of character with the rest of the block and conceivably with the rest of the neighborhood. In order to address this. Staff looked at the current minimum lot size standard, which is 12,000 square feet. And right now there is no maximum lot size standard, but there is a lot size minimum. So the proposal that staff is recommending is that there be a merger of no more than two lots in the neighborhood and that the merged lot site can. The merged lot size cannot exceed 20,000 square feet. And again, what you see in the detail here is just a breakdown of some of the things, the number of various lot sizes within the 0 to 15 category there. You can see that this is the size of most of the lots in the neighborhood. There are 553 lots within the 0 to 15 size standard and then there are 50 lots that are between 15 and 20,000 and there are 44 lots that are 20,000 square feet or greater. Lastly, in the what I've just reviewed for you were some of the development standards that relates the size and the the amount of lot or the amount of structure that could be built on the property. What I'd like to cover now really briefly are some of the design standards, and these relate to the look how the lot looks and how it relates to the surrounding properties. These are design standards and they are essentially pretty basic in terms of how when staff reviews a property, the kinds of things we look for. But these are not currently in the code and staffers recommending that these design standards be added. However, they're not added to every single new home that we consider reviewing, but they are only for the very largest lots. So this would apply if a home was proposed to be 5000 square feet in size or if it's within ten feet of its maximum FSR. And I'll briefly go through these. They are just that we would be looking to make sure that there is four sided architecture on the design that assures that someone, if they have a large home like this, that the that the architectural attention would go to all sides of the building and not just to the front. To maintain the integrity of the architectural style. The other one is related to making sure that there are not large expanses of blank walls without any articulation or any design features. So the second standard is to make sure or to make sure that no expanse of any wall greater than 25 feet occurs without some articulation or some design feature. That's the second standard. The third is that the primary facade or the primary interest to the building should be oriented to the street. And this precludes a property from having a front door on the side of the house. And again, it speaks to, again, best practices in terms of architectural design and neighborhood character, in terms of how the house is oriented to the street. And the other part of that relates to the height of the porches and the entryways to the home, that those not exceed 15 feet again, so that the front door has some relationship to the rest of the architecture of the building. And lastly, the the final design standard that staff thought was appropriate. Again, all of these are based upon feedback from the neighbors is the issue of privacy. So what we're asking is that for the second story, windows that the bedroom windows of the the proposed new structure not line up directly with the existing bedroom windows of the adjacent property. Again, this addresses the issue of privacy. So that concludes the standards that staff is recommending. I would just like to confirm or at least make sure that the that you're aware that these standards, if they are adopted by the city council, they, of course, would not be retroactive. They would not apply to any of the existing units or the design of any existing homes. However, they would apply if a property owner came in to build a new unit or an expansion of an existing unit. And again, these standards would only apply to the extent that the expansion or the new unit triggered any one of those particular standards that staff has recommended. With that, I'd like to conclude the staff's presentation and recommend that the City Council affirm the recommendation of the Planning Commission and accept categorical exemption number c e 16 340 and also that they approve this recommended zoning ordinance amendment to modify the five development standards that I just walked through, as well as the four design standards that were recommended. And that concludes staff's presentation. And Mark and myself are here to respond to any questions you might have. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Tatum, for those comments. So now we will go to public comment. Is there any public comment on the proposal on this hearing? Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the Council. My name is Karen Miller. I've lived in the Los Cerritos neighborhood for 20 years and I also sell real estate in. That little Cerritos. Neighborhood. I am here tonight to urge you to please support the recommendations by the planning staff. City planners have worked with preserve lists of widows for over two years, diligently to come up with compromises to help preserve the quality of our neighborhood, the green spaces. And also without infringing on any homeowners rights. I think we've got a pretty good plan. But you'll hear from people. Tonight that oppose it. And the reason I know this is I received this flier on Sunday. It says it all caps. Attention, homeowners. City Hall is trying to take your property. Well, that's. Just not true. I think what we've come up with is a. Very good plan. And I urge you to please support it. Thank you. Any further public comment? If anyone would like to speak on this matter, could you come forth now so that we have an understanding of how many people are expect to speak? All right, ma'am, I'll give you your name and go ahead and proceed. Hi. My name is Renee Hunt, and I live in the area that we're talking about. And first of all, thank you for the introduction for the Councilwoman Price for the New Year and Happy New Year. And in that uniqueness that we celebrated tonight, our neighborhood is a unique neighborhood and 85 plus years, I know my home is that old or near there. And I think the zoning that we have is really served us well, although I do appreciate the time and effort put in by the employees of the city and they have been very responsive and kind in their meetings and I appreciate that and very professional. I don't believe in limiting the use of the land, as we saw in the slides with the FAA, are reducing the fear that a property owner can use. Now, I don't think that's needed. And also as an interior designer, I have difficulty accepting the design treatment and finish restrictions. And I know some of my colleagues in like San Marino area and Pasadena have come across some of these issues for zoning that's happened there. And a lot of their clients have bought specifically for that neighborhood. But then when coming against these hurdles have decided to move out. It was just too much to follow through with the plans that they had. So I think that. It wouldn't be fair. Our neighborhood. Well, I think we've done great so far. It's a desired neighborhood and I think the zoning has done as well so far. So I hope you would consider that in your votes. And I appreciate your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And if everyone could come a little bit closer. So we have an understanding on how many people are lined up to speak. Hi, I'm Polly Thomas. I've lived in Long Beach for 32 years. This is the third time in all that that I've spoken at a city council meeting. So it's a rare occurrence and it's also very nerve wracking. It takes a lot to come down here to speak. I am concerned about this proposal. And the first part, I do consider it a taking of the property because the homeowners will not be able to use it as they were able to use it. 10 minutes before your vote. So that's one thing. The second thing is that I am surprised that this is not being handled as a zone code, which usually requires, if I understand correctly, the signature of every homeowner. But it's been explained to me by the Planning Department who I will say have all been very professional, polite and friendly and a pleasure to do, to work with. But it was explained to me that they got around that requirement by calling it a zone code amendment, and for that reason, it doesn't require every homeowner's signature. So I am perplexed as to why you would even want to do that when we are limiting what homeowners can do on their property that they own the. The second thing is that I just want to thank you for your time and consideration. And I do think that someone said here that they had been working on this for two years. And the first inkling I received of this was in August of 2015 and did reach out to the planning department, but there was a changeover and who was handling the project. So no one was involved in an opposition to this matter until really October of 2016. And I think that that is remiss and something that we should take into consideration before making such sweeping changes for this district. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Jeanie Williamson I've been a resident of the Virginia Country Club area for 35 years, and this has been interesting for me to to be in the committee. I have a couple of hats here tonight. I'm on the board of the ALCINA, which is the Little Cerritos Neighborhood Association, in which you'll hear from later, because we do support this, you know, and we have we are a neighborhood association of the whole r1l not just portion of it all the whole part, but also is being on the committee. And I got to tell you, a couple of years ago, okay, 30 figure 35 years of the neighborhood and this I one as held up well until about five years ago then we started seeing homes built on the whole lot, you know, and especially on a main street where as a corner house itself, there was only supposed to be a four foot leeway with that's hardly room from the sidewalk with you're not hitting a wall then and taking up the whole area now envision the peninsula, okay, in Long Beach where they've taken the single story homes and they put the home on that whole lot up there. That's what we're starting to see. And I'm. Are you going to see like two homes like that that totally takes away from the character of our neighborhood and the front yard and the spaciousness and that country club kind of feeling that we all buy into. It's one of your last remaining areas of Long Beach that is like that. And what makes me sad is to see neighbors now who have said that they haven't been informed. But this has been an excellent process the whole time we've been talking in the concerts in the park. We've gotten our 300 signatures last summer, 200 more signatures. When you talk one on one, they understand. Like when I first started this process, I didn't know what an FA was, you know, but now, now I understand it and now I can see it. And it is to maintain that because what I wanted to try to express to you is up until now, the r1l has worked, but you have developers, you have speculators moving in like you see, they find a small home, they'll build up the two stories, you know, and it will become like the peninsula. And like many, many areas of Los Angeles, like you see along the beach areas and I'm sat with my neighbors the misconceptions that they may have. And I like to encourage you if there's something that you don't understand and I know you do this anyway, but if there's something specific that you hear that you don't understand , please ask Linda or Mark, you know, and they will really clear it up for you. I like for you to understand it. Thank you for your time. And oh, I want to add one less thing about design. You know, if you look at these designs that the Planning Department has added into that, you know, we were basically are setbacks and front setbacks and all that really. You know, it's what designers are going to have a problem with your window looking into your neighbors window. I think these are very simple, cated, simple designs, not specifically going to hurt any particular type of architecture. Thank you so much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Honorable council members and vice. Mayor. My name is Barbara showing 4120 Locust Avenue. We've lived in our home since 1972 in Virginia Country Club and we love the neighborhood. When we came for you about a year and a half ago to. Ask for the moratorium, as I recall, several of you actually. Mentioned you were particularly. Interested in this issue because mansion ization. Has become an issue not just in Los Cerritos, but in parts other parts of Long Beach. I was talking to a friend who lives in Castle Heights. She said, I don't want mansions. In my neighborhood. I see the and they have a historic district. So there. But in in Belmont Heights and Park Estates and there are other. Areas of the. City where I know that this. Is also an issue. So what we do in Los Cerritos may be an example, but it's not just here. It's all over Los Angeles County. If you read The Times, you see it all the time where communities are concerned about this. As was mentioned. Before, we were concerned. About flippers. Coming in, buying a little house, building a big one, making lots of money and leaving. And that's not in the. Best interest of the. Neighborhood. I wanted to also thank the staff. Mark and Linda and Carrie have been phenomenal. They've come out, they've walked around. They've seen our. Concern. They've worked with us very carefully. We get everything we want it know. Do they know? We work together and negotiated to. We came up with. What we think all. Think are very. Reasonable standards. And so we feel that with the staff we've come up with modest. Yet reasonable modifications to prevent inappropriately oversize. Homes. And I want to make clear one other thing, because there seems to. Be some misunderstanding. And that is. That only if you're in a historic. District or you will have a formal homeowners association. Like Park Estates do. Can the city have any control over the type of architectural design features? We have a neighborhood association, as was mentioned, but we can't control what kind of roof, what kind of siding, what kind of windows? Nothing like that. Only historic districts and homeowners associations can do that. So with that. I'll just thank you for. Their time and urge you to adopt the recommendations. And I want to. Particularly thank our. Wasden, because you've been wonderful. Listening to us, I think listening to everybody. And hearing all of our concerns. And so l thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Esteemed Council persons and Vice Mayor Richardson. My name is Stacy McDaniel. I reside at 4110 Cedar Avenue. I'm also a member of the Preserve Lost three. This committee formed when over 200 of our. Neighbors voiced opposition. To some of the new construction being built in the. Neighborhood. I support. The changes to the R-1 L zoning. Standards and commend. The Planning Department for their professionalism. And extensive outreach to the. Community. Would all those in the audience who. Also support these changes briefly stand? Thank you. The proposed changes are all about controlling out of scale development and have nothing to do with imposing design standards on the neighborhood. This is what I look at every day. After the. Prior owners of my the next door house who bought an existing. One story home. Built it. To the maximum degree. Permitted under the current. Standards and flip it. Our property is a third in the shadow about half of the year caused by this plaster chunk. These are some examples of what our. Neighbors are concerned about. Basically homes that do not fit the scale of the neighborhood. Even this one, which tends to be the lightning. Rod for controversy, might be okay if it was up by. The country club. But the fact of the matter is that it was built in the middle of a. Block on three aggregated lots, and it's grossly out of. Scale to its neighbors. It is, in fact, almost. Four times larger than the adjacent neighbors. There's nothing personal against that owner or any owner or opposition. As to the impact to the neighborhood. Our opponents speculate that property. Values will go down by enacting the proposed changes, but the documents we've already provided you. Disprove that assumption. Our opponents. Also claim that we are a small band of. Dissatisfied retirees with an ax to grind against certain architectural standards. Had they participated in the numerous public meetings and public discussions of this issue, or. Even if they were active in. Community life here in the neighborhood, they would know that the vast majority. Of the residents of low spirited support these changes. This is just a partial list of over the 400 people that signed petitions in favor of these types of curbs on mansion ization. The proposed changes are consistent with and not in opposition to the general plan. In fact, the r1l zoning area was created in 1980 in recognition of the unique character of the Low Streets area with its. Quote, open, uncrowded living environment. Indeed, the. Last time this. Council considered the mansion ization issue in 2007, when Belmont Shore and Belmont Heights. Were the poster. Child for Mansion Association, your standing directive to the Planning Department was to come up with additional rules to prevent mansion exemption as needed. Thank you. Thank you for your time. 3 minutes. The proposed changes do an admirable job of this and we support them. Please vote yes. Thank you so much. And just an employee. When we when the clapping happens, it actually cuts into the next speaker's comments. Next speaker, please. Members of the city council. My name is Richard Ivey. I represent the Las Vegas Neighborhood Association, which supports this effort by the city planning staff and the planning commissioners. That will most certainly help preserve the character and home values in this neighborhood. The Las Vegas Neighborhood Association represents. We request that the city council approve the r1l standards changes as proposed by the city planning staff and as approved by the Planning Commission. The proposed changes are the culmination of a two year effort that was begun by City Council action and enacted by the planning staff. The proposed changes are not the result of a knee jerk reaction, but a measured response to professionals who have addressed the issues. The planning staff took charge, investigated the standards, toured the neighborhood, held community outreach meetings, and independently formulated these standards that will help preserve. The character of our wonderful neighborhood. We appreciate the planning, staff's dedication, professionalism in bringing these recommendations before you. The any hopes that you will vote to enact these standards as proposed. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi. My name is Kevin Case. I live on Locust. I had a lot more to say, but I think it's mostly been said. But one thing that is interesting for me is, yes, I've lived in the neighborhood a long time, over 27 years. But four years ago I moved and when I did that, I didn't choose to go somewhere else like that. I'm not sure Naples or even Manhattan Beach stayed in the same neighborhood, moved three blocks away. And that was only because of the charm, the character of the neighbors. It's wide streets, old trees and open views. It's a wonderful. Place and we'd like to see it stay similar. Thanks. Thank you next week. And please. Good evening, Mayor and Council. My name is Larry Tidwell. I'm an architect and I've lived in this neighborhood for over 25 years. As other people have said, it's the character of the neighborhood we're trying to preserve here, that the wide open spaces, the large setbacks, the architectural character of many different styles of homes in the neighborhood that were built not by one developer, but by individual owners and architects over a span of many decades. So we have a great variety of eclectic style of homes, but they all they're all respective of each other and they're neighbors. So nobody's house looms over another house. And these changes to the zoning code clarify the character of the neighborhood better than the current zoning requirements do by reducing the floor area ratio and increasing the setbacks it makes. The written language of the code match the reality of almost all the homes in the neighborhood today. So by adopting these changes, we preserve what's there. We don't limit the character and the design and the architecture of homes, but just make sure that everybody can be respectful of each species, their neighbors and the whole community in which we all live. Thank you. Thank you. Next picture, please. Vice Mayor Richardson and Honorable City Councilmembers. My name is Jim McDaniel. I live on Cedar Avenue. I'd like to thank the staff of Councilman Al Austin and Councilman Austin himself, the planning commission, the the staff of the Planning Department and the residents of those three for all the work that has been put into this effort. I'm speaking tonight in support of the staff recommendation for changes to the R-1 L Zone Development and Design Standards. The proposed standards are designed to allow for a great variety of architectural styles that make our neighborhoods so special. They do not impose any sort of specific architectural style requirement on our neighborhood. This is not an attempt to Irvine ize our neighborhood. In fact, it will probably just do the opposite by restricting large slab sited structures that pervade much of Orange County in the San Gabriel Valley and encourage thoughtfully designed homes in scale with their neighbors . The proposed standards protect setbacks and traditional house massing to better preserve the character of the neighborhood. When large two storey walls are built with minimal setbacks, light and air are restricted from neighboring homes. These standards will help keep structures from impinging on the light and air space from of adjacent properties. The proposed standards will still allow houses of significant size as long as they are in scale with the lots in which they're being built. The planning staff has told us that the average house size and low cerritos is 2850 square feet, more or less, and that the largest home in the neighborhood is around 8400 square feet. Under the proposed standards, homes on our largest lots could be as large as 16,000 square feet, which is much larger than anything now existing and on a more typical large lot. You could still build homes of 6000 square feet, which is large compared to the neighborhood. The proposed standards will protect and improve our property values. Cities such as Arcadia, where marginalization was not addressed, have seen a drop in property values compared to neighboring communities such as Sierra madre, where sensible standards were implemented. This update to the development standards is urgently required now due to market forces. As property values across Southern California continue to rise. Speculators are looking at neighborhoods like ours to tear down older, smaller houses and build structures that maximize house size. Minimum costs, oftentimes on small lots. This is already happening in our neighborhood, and it's not adding to home values. In closing, I would like to commend the professionalism of the Planning Department staff. This has been a long effort and much patience has been required from all involved. We believe that the proposal that is before you this evening is a result of a compromise in the best tradition of that word that addresses all the interests that were brought forward. Some of the neighbors may not have gotten all they wanted. Others may feel this goes too far. But this is a solid proposal that was carefully crafted and considered by the staff and large numbers of neighbors dedicated over the last 24 months. And it deserves your support. Thank you. Thank you so much for your time. So seeing no further public comment, we're going to close the hearing and take it back behind the rail. Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I want to thank all of the residents who took time out to come out and give testimony this evening on this hearing, as well as those of you who have met with me in my office and the coffee over coffee and throughout the neighborhood. I've received a number of input from residents over the past several months. In the spring of 2015, I was approached by a group of residents from the Lower Cerritos neighborhood who had concerns about some of the new homes that were being built. And they wanted to revise the development standards for their neighborhood. They had done some research and collect the signatures from many neighbors. Rosarito, north of Bixby Road, is the only neighborhood in the city that has our one el zone designated for large lots. I was willing to entertain the discussion and in July of 2015, the City Council approved a motion to start the process to put a moratorium in place. The request, the planning staff and the Planning Commission to review the issue, meet with the community and make recommendations to the City Council. More than a year and a half later, we're here tonight. I must say upfront that the planning staff has done an excellent job on this and has put far more time than I originally expected it would take. I would especially like to thank Linda Tatum, Karie Tai and Mark Underwood for their Hungerford, for their efforts. They had several meetings with the groups of registered residents, both for and against the changes. They held two community meetings where all 647 homeowners were invited. They brought in a consultant to help facilitate the Community Meetings. Plan Commission conducted a public study session on the issue last December and held hearings last month to vote on. Commendations. And so more after more than a year and a half with plenty of public input input as staff work on this issue. We're here tonight. However, I still believe that there are two outstanding issues. And number one. Is there consensus among the homeowners in the neighborhood for these changes? The number two, is there a need for these changes? On the first question, it appears that there is not. Obviously, from the public comment here, there are people on both sides of this. I received a number of email correspondences and they are both for and against. And so I don't think there's consensus on this issue. As the process has moved along, I've spoken with more residents who have concerns about what is being proposed. Some who said that they've signed a position, they signed a petition at the beginning and now they don't agree with what's being proposed. I personally am uncomfortable with fully embracing the changes to neighborhood zones requirements that is not fully embraced by the neighborhood itself. On the second question, is there a real need for changes? I'm not yet convinced of this either. According to planning staff of the 25 largest homes in a neighborhood, a lots of up to 15,000 square feet. Only one was built since 1990. Of the 25 largest homes, a loss of more than 15,000 square feet. Only two were built since the year 2000, and there have been only three permits issued in the past ten years for the construction of new homes, and only 12 have been issued permits for additions of more than 1000 square feet in the last ten years . We are not seeing a major transformation of the neighborhood that is being experienced in some cities that have adopted mass immunization ordinances. I know that there's one home in the neighborhood that's been a focus of much of the drive against marginalization. There's some incremental and I believe that there are some incremental steps that we can take to not have similar homes built in the little Cerritos neighborhood. From the beginning, I've heard far more consensus against a lot mergers, and I support the Planning Commission's recommendations proposing a restriction to no lot more mergers of more than two lots or exceeding a total of 20,000 square feet. I also believe that increasing the front yard set back from 20 feet to 25 feet is consistent with what is already exist in the neighborhood. And so I don't have a problem with that. Finally, the Planning Commission recommended some additional design standards for new proposed large homes, which I believe there's a general support for. The other proposed new restrictions on saleyards, set backs and reducing floor area ratios or if they are, would make some current homes in a neighborhood that many consider to be quality homes out of compliance with the new standards. There are approximately 18 homes that currently exist, all of which were built prior to 1985. That would become non-conforming by just reducing the FHA from 6.602.50. And there are many more long standing homes that will become non-conforming because of the proposed site setbacks. Under the proposed standards. I know many of the homeowners have concerns about the proposed changes, and I believe that the incremental approach is the most prudent approach at this time, and it may not completely satisfy everyone. But again, I don't see a neighborhood. I don't like to see a neighborhood divided against itself, which this discussion has done, unfortunately. The city is currently going through an update of our land use element and after that we'll be revising our entire zoning ordinance. And if we find a problem that arises in the next few years, I don't currently see which I don't currently see, there will be another opportunity to address the zoning standards at that time and much of the legwork. Fortunately has already been done. I do appreciate the input of the many residents and the work of the Planning Commission staff and the Planning Commission itself during this process. Therefore, I'd like to make a motion. To receive the supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and accept category categorical exemption number. See $16 340. Hold on. And to clear the ordinance amending Table three 31.2 A of the Long Beach Municipal Code Residential Development Standards amended to establish a 25 foot minimum front yard setback and amend Table 31 to a in the notes section of the table to indicate that lots created three land subdivision or lot merger shall not exceed 20,000 square feet and the lot merger shall not be comprised of more than two lots and omitted that amend section 21.30 1.255 of the Municipal Cook Code Municipal Code relating to the design treatment and finish to add subsections f one through four as set forth in the draft ordinance submitted to the Council for its consideration tonight, read for the first time and laid over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading. And that is my motion. Thank you. Councilman Austin, city attorney. Did you get that, Mr. Mays? You get that. Okay, Councilman, you ringa. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just want to commend everybody involved, staff council member Austin and people in the public for their engagement in this in this effort. It's been a long time coming. And I think that the plan, as it is currently adopted or proposed to be adopted is a is the end of all the discussions that have been taking place. And I'm glad to see that there has been some agreement, mostly agreement on the on the proposed plans, I think, in this. Thank you. Councilman. Councilman. Mongo. So I at the very end, I know there was a little bit of a change of what I had read before. So you're taking out two items. The Lots. No, we tell that little end part, but it was really long in the very. Way I am proposing or my motion is to accept everything proposed or recommended by the Planning Commission except the side lot. So back setbacks as well as the floor area ratio recommendations, but everything else. So then the status quo on those two items would remain in effect, right? Okay. So the fifth District has had a lot of discussion around double lots and things like that as well. And so I just wanted to offer a point of clarification to the city manager. It sounds as though that the decision being made tonight is only on. Well, first, I should start with how many districts in the city fall under this zone? How many groups besides these 400 homes? There are no other districts in the city that have the same standards that are in this particular neighborhood, the r1l zone. This area, geographically, is the only location in the city that has this particular zoning. And are there any plans for any other areas to have this kind of zoning? No, I think this goes to a bit about what some of our residents were saying tonight about the misinformation that's out in the community. In the fifth district, we have double lots, but they are not r1l zones. And so the the comments and dialogs that I had actually when I bumped into someone at the grocery store today and the coffee shop and the UPS store were a little bit confused because I think that people believe that anything that happens in one part of the city is for the whole city. And I think that it's really important for people to know that each part of our city is very different. The city of Long Beach is as big as I mean, some cities in L.A. County are one 1/40 of the size of the city of Long Beach. So this is not a process for anything other than the 400 homes in this particular area. And then I just wanted to ask one additional follow up question. Should there be a time where a resident wants an exception to what we passed tonight? What would that process look like? There is a process in the zoning code called a variance procedure. However, it is very limited to a very unique situation, such as an irregular lot size or a lot size that has or a lot that has an unusual slope. Some other shape issue or geographical issue, but not just convenience. It's intended to be very unique and limited in its application. So if someone wanted an exception that lived in that area and they thought that it was worthy of consideration, would they be able to bring it to or would their council member or another councilmember be able to bring it to this board and get five votes and change that? Or would they need to change it. For the whole area? I would have to say it would really depend upon the circumstance in the situation because for one unique lot, it likely may not warrant a change to the code, but that is the kind of thing that staff would look at and examine. And if we felt that a change to the code was warranted, it would likely go forward as a recommended code change rather than just an action on an individual property. And that is very unique. And to your knowledge, we have not been doing that here in the city of Long Beach. That is correct. Wonderful. And that's all my questions. And I'll be supporting the motion. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. I just like to, before we vote, just state how a little Cerritos Virginia Country Club neighborhood is one of the, I think, best in the city whether or not we approve this tonight. It is still one of the more desirable areas in the city to live in. It is an awesome community. My, my, my emotion was the spirit of the motion was to seek to get consensus and an a strike, a medium medium with the the community and the residents, because there is a lot of division on this issue in terms of property rights and existing homes that are there, amazing homes that, again , if they were built today, would not fall into what is being proposed. What was proposed by the Planning Commission. And so understand whether or not you agree with the decision or not or the motion or not. Please understand that we put a lot of thought into this and we really looking to find a balance and something that that does preserve the quality and integrity and character of the Los Cerritos neighborhood. Members. Thank you, Councilman Austin. So and I'll just share that. This is a really beautiful neighborhood. This is a really nice neighborhood. I see why it's got so much interest in it. I think Councilman Alston has done a good job, will do with paid attention to the way folks have been engaged. Staff has done a great job on this. Sometimes, you know, when these things happen, you have you know, when issues come up, you try your best to build as much consensus as possible. And I like the approach of, you know, the things that have consensus and moving forward. It makes it a lot easier for me to support Councilman Alston with his motion. So I urge and I vote. Councilman Andrews Yes, and I also want to commend Councilman awesomeness motion here because the fact that I think when I retire I'm just thinking about moving that way. So. Thank you. No further comment. Members, please cast your vote. That's.","Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by amending Table 31-2A, residential development standards, and by adding Section 21.31.255.F, relating to development and design standards applicable to properties in the R-1-L zoning district, read and adopted as read.

Thank you, Councilwoman and Councilman Espinosa, did you also have a question or comment on these or is that hanging from us? I did have a question go for. And it's only if somebody is here to answer and it's more just informational. I can get it offline as well. If I understand all these funds have been decreased from years past, if anyone's here with the prior information, you know, and then Councilwoman Ortega just wanted to point out that there's CDBG as well as 1087. I don't know if you want to consider that one as well. Typically it's just the home and the Harper fans. Okay, great. Thank you. Can you speak to the councilman's question? Yeah. So basically, do you know why 16 numbers for home Hoppa and CDBG from HUD? I do. I do. Good evening. It's Susan Lee from the Office of Economic Development. I've got the annual numbers right here, Councilman. Great. We'll start with CDBG. Last year, CDBG was 6,531,000. This year at 6 million 602. So it's actually up just a slight bit. Keep in mind, however, that the historic trend has been significantly. Down. From 2011. We're down about 17%. On the home funds, which are exclusively, of course, for housing. Last year's numbers were 2 million 363 638. This year's numbers are 2 million 362 617. So down very slightly, a few nickels and dimes. But again, for historical. Context. Since 2011, the home funds are down 38%. And lastly on Hopper, a little bit more encouraging news. Those numbers are much more stable. It's a relatively small grant. Last year was 1 million 562 737. This year it's 1,000,007, 86, 90. So it's actually up 12% this year. All right. So thank you for that information. You're welcome to sort of be aware of how the funding has changed over time.

All right. And I thought we might have Andrew Thomas here. All right. Hello, Mr. Thomas. Are you presenting, I take it? Yes. I'll make this quick as well. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, just fine. All right. I'm Andrew Thomas. Planning building and transportation director at the council may remember that the city council, the planning board and staff have been working very hard over the last three or four months on what we all know as the Boat Works project. In March, the City Council took an important action to really resolve over 15 years of disputes and really move this project forward so we can finally get that new housing and waterfront access that we've been talking about for many, many years of the boat work site located on Clement at the corner of Oak. So there's been a number of actions that we've all been working on over the last few months. In March, the council approved the settlement agreement. In April, the council, a planning board, and the council in two separate meetings recommended and then adopted the development plan, tentative map and other entitlements for the project. At that time in April, the Council may remember that there was a request from the applicant for a waiver of universal design requirements. Staff did not recommend that waiver. At that time, we felt it was premature because there's a process laid out in the ordinance for that, for the consideration of those waivers and that process hadn't been followed. So the council approved the entitlements in April, but not the waiver. In May, the applicant began working with staff and brought their waiver to the Disability Commission for review and comment. The Disabilities Commission's job is to advise the. Planning Board. On these types of waivers. So their recommendations went to the Planning Board on May 11th. The Planning Board considered a recommendation to approve the waiver from staff with a list of conditions that had been negotiated with the applicant. At that meeting, the Planning Board added a few more conditions with the intent of making all of the units more adaptable and the Planning Board believed, based on the conversations that occurred with the applicant at the meeting, that the applicant was was comfortable with those conditions. The Planning Board under fully understands the history of this project and the many years of of dispute. So they were working hard to try to work something out that would improve the project but also be acceptable to the applicant. But, you know, as these Zoom meetings go, communication was a little bit difficult, I think. And shortly after, a few days after the meeting, the boat works team realized that there were a few of the conditions they couldn't live with and they needed to request some amendments to those to those conditions. So their only recourse at that point was to appeal to council the proposed adjustments to the Planning Board's additional conditions. Staff is recommending that you approve changes this. If you do and uphold their appeal request, then that will be really a major milestone in moving this project towards completion. And for from staff's perspective, we it was disappointing that we weren't able to do better with the universal design requirements, but to do so would require a complete redesign of this project. And given the history of the project and given all the work that's been done by all the boards and commissions over the last few years, that that just we can't recommend going trying to go back that way. And we just think it would lead to more dispute and argument. So we're recommending you uphold the appeal and make the adjustments to the conditions as shown in the attached remarks. But that I will do my presentation and I'm available to answer any questions that the board may have. Excuse me, the city council may have. I think we also have representatives from the boat works team. They're here to answer questions if you need them. They don't have any comments to make at this time. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. And I think, Councilmember Belton, I see your hand up for your hand. Okay. Um, so any questions of Mr. Thomas and seeing then, Madam Clerk, do we have any public. Speakers here remembered? Have one quick comment on the zoom. I was muted. Sorry, I. All right. Hello, Miss Kenny. Hello. Thank you for having me tonight. I want to give you a little bit more context of what happened at the Commission on Disability. We recommended against grabbing this way. This waiver represents a gutting of the universal design, and the presenting materials presented by the works did not demonstrate how this was financially feasible. It definitely would cost time and we have a commission definitely want to keep things moving. As far as we understand, there's a housing crisis. But at this point. This waiver, when it was brought to us, lacked sincerity. As far as one of the things I asked is, are there ways that we can have accessibility through the garage? That's one of the things that the planning board asked them to. Look into in. Section three, that they're asking as part of their waiver on what the. Planning. Board asked them to do. If you can have an. Entrance through. Another door to the garage, that opens up townhomes. To people the way. That this boat works. Design Right now, almost every universal design unit is going to be in the affordable housing building. None of the townhomes would be accessible or vegetables. And. The so the fact that the commission did not want this, we understood that given the litigious nature of the works. It was likely to go through. We asked for them to consider other ways that they could include accessibility. The fact that we're now here because they didn't want to even consider concluding those other ways speaks to the concerns that we had in the first place. This is the attempt to go the universal design or news and ask. To increase. Process on the part of the disabled community. This is not. This this there's. No demonstration here of why they can't even consider as the project develops, seeing how they can create opportunities for entrance into a unit so that somebody can come in, but they don't want to do that. That's what they're asking you to do tonight. I think that the section that they're asking you to leave it under is really interesting because it says for affordable housing costs. Now, all of nine of the concepts that they're asking you to rate tonight have to do with the affordable housing section of this development. It all has to do with the townhomes. And the. Single family. Homes. This time. That is not the issue. And your time is up. Thank you, Miss Kenny. Do anybody else a speaker who has raised their hand. Okay. Shona Armstrong. All right. And okay. Ms.. Armstrong is with the applicant, correct? Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. Ms.. Armstrong. Hi. I just wanted to respond to the comment that the applicant is very willing to consider and look at additional accessibility possibilities. The letter from the engineer that accompanied the request for the waiver laid out the limitations, and he worked really hard at trying to figure out how to make them maximally accessible, given the layout that's been approved through this complex process that we've all been a part of the problem. One of the big problems is that accessible and visible under the code actually doesn't allow for access through the garage. It has to be accessed through the door. So while there could well, someone could get in through the garage, it doesn't qualify under the law. And so that's why we're asking for this waiver. But we're very open and will be looking for opportunities to provide additional accessibility. We just. Given the layout that has been very. Laboriously worked out at this point, I can't promise that it will meet the specifics of the code in every respect. Thank you. All right. Anything further? No, thanks. Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. Madam, quick, do we have any further comments? Public comments? No, we have none. All right. And Mr. Thomas, back to you. Did you want to add anything? No, I don't think there's anything to add at this point. I apologize. I didn't mean to misrepresent the disability commission. They were very concerned with the design for sure. And I think from from staff perspective, you know, one of the big problems with this project and it's not an inherent yes, it is an inherent problem. I mean, we designed this project in 2011. Those of you who've been around with us, you know, we weren't thinking about universal design in 2011. We're just starting to what we're resolving tonight, if we move this forward, if the council moves us forward, is really resolving a series of issues that have revolved around that project. If we were starting from scratch, we would probably and had the luxury of being able to completely redesign the project today. We probably could do better from a universal design perspective. I'm sure we could, but as I said earlier, that we're just really staff doesn't feel the city has the luxury to be able to say, hey, let's just start over. I think what we've been trying to achieve over the last few months is, well, let's let's complete this, let's finish, move on. And I think the last thing I would say is I think we as a community can stay committed to our universal design audience. This I hope this project is an anomaly, not, you know, a new standard. And just for my clarification, so what Ms.. Armstrong said and I thought I'd read it in the staff report, is that it is still possible to enter a unit through the garage, that some of the town hall units. That's on on a number of the units have everything. Needed to. Be universal design. The issue is meeting the grade for a wheelchair to get from either the alley or the sidewalk into the unit. And if you do a strict interpretation of the slopes and does that meet the requirement that I think believe the 5% grade? No, that does not on either side. I think what Shauna is describing is and. The engineers that work with each. Unit as we move through the process, they can look at literally each house. I mean, we're now we're talking about a foot, a couple inches here, there, and the grading that can make the difference so that it. Would meet the. Legal standard. I mean, if you're good in a wheelchair, you're going to be able to get into this unit. But does it meet a legal standard? That's sort of the ADA standard for 5%. No, it does not. But if I recall correctly, and I'm just revisiting this staff report, this is I mean, there is still a percentage of units that have the excess. Yes. Yes, it. Is. Let me just clarify for the record, I think the standard in our ordinance, 30% universal design. This project is 15%. And then the other standard in our ordinance is 100% visibility. And this project has 50% visibility. So it's essentially it's getting 50% of the requirement both both both criteria. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Counsel Comments. He doesn't want to be councilmember. Councilman. Oh, I'm sorry. Miss Weiss, are you telling me something? We were just. Mr. McGillis, I think he's representing the project. He was wanting to comment, I think, but I didn't know if he was clarifying a point or we're not exactly sure. Robert Okay. Do you think he's. I don't know. Okay, well, counsel, hold your thoughts. What? We just finished a public comment and if indeed we support everybody. Hello? Can you hear me? Appreciate your time tonight. I just wanted to point out a couple of things related to extensibility. It's important for. Research. For those of us who don't quite recognize your name, although it looks familiar, could you just tell us who you are and how you're feeling? I think no worries. My name is Robert McGinnis. I'm one of the project architects for the project. I've been working with city staff Andrew Thomas for years on this project, hoping to get some this project realized to the benefit of the community. I just wanted to point out to the council members and members of the public who might not realize that this project, as proposed, far exceeds the state of California's accessibility. The challenge we had was recognizing the universal design ordinance and some of the criteria there. And so I think the painting of a picture that we're not trying to do or achieve accessibility may be misconstrued by some of the comments that were made. But we're certainly we tried after the planning board made some recommendation recommendations to accommodate those things. And so we did work as much of that as we could back into the current proposal. So I think it's important to note. Thank you. All right. Anything further? No, that's all. Thank you for your time. Thank you. All right. And, Madam Clerk, any. Any further public speakers? That was all. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So I know I was calling on someone. Councilmember Odie. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So this is a question for Mr. Thomas. And if you don't know the answer, that's fine. Um, my other projects that we've approved prior to the universal design, I mean, what are their numbers? Because this is, what, 15 and 50, right? Yeah, I know. The the other, the more recent project, which I don't have the exact numbers, was the Pulte Alameda Landing Waterfront Project, about 350 units. I forget their exact, uh, uh, universal design numbers, but I believe it was also around 15%. Now they had the benefit of a development agreement where we had pre-negotiated the 15%, but that was all done before we did our universal design ordinance. So but it adds, you know, it's it does come back to the that project as well is a lot of townhomes and the townhomes are very difficult to get the visibility. The other great example is Alameda Marina. Alameda Marina, if you remember, about 700 units total, about half in multi-family housing, you know, stacked flats with elevators. The other half and townhomes they doubled are universal design standard. Because of that housing type, they were able to get not 30%, but 50%. Now, on the townhomes, they struggled and they had to come to the disability commission planning board for a waiver on the visibility because that's 100% requirement and it affects the townhomes as well. So, you know, I think if you're doing a multifamily building with elevator, our ordinance is not hard to meet. If you're doing townhomes, it's really it's very problematic. Okay. Thank you. Any further questions or comments? Emotion. I was vice mayor. I'm happy to make a motion to, but I'm just a quick comment. I appreciate Mr. and Mrs. Kenney and Mr. Thomas making very cogent arguments for why townhomes are a housing type that doesn't meet a number of our city goals. Unfortunately, there are also the housing type that tends to pay for the infrastructure and the projects, and so we end up having to pay for those. As somebody who in and I know a number of us did work really hard on the universal design. It is not easy to, you know, kind of grant waivers like this. But as Mr. Thomas pointed out, this is a project that we've been working on since 2011. I think we have had very good success on projects where we they come in and they know that the universal design ordinance is there or we set out the goals ahead of time. And I certainly don't think that this is a project where we're going to be able to go back and easily recreate it from scratch in order to do that to meet the new update updated ordinance. So with that, I would be I would move for approval of the staff recommendation to make the amendments to grant the waiver. All right. Thank you. We have a motion to have a second. I will reluctantly. Second. Okay. Councilmember Ody has seconded any discussion. I will just say that I read this staff report carefully. Actually, a couple of times. And I. I deeply appreciate the work that our Commission on Persons with Disabilities does. And they are all very committed individuals. I, I also understand the struggles that this project grapples with. And I was convinced from reading the staff report in the supporting documents that a good faith effort has gone into this and that the the intentionality is there. I and I I'm also heartened by the fact that there it is possible to enter through the garage. So even though in some of the townhomes, depending on the grade. But so even though that can't be counted towards meeting code, it's, you know, it would offer some visibility. But I do think that best efforts have been made. I think this is one area where I would say to consider not to make the perfect the enemy of the good, because we have struggled for a long time to get housing built in this very, you know, desirable location close to public transit. And and again, we we do have universal design and visibility, just you not the the the maximum percentage. So I am fully prepared to support and I see Councilmember Village hand up. Councilor Vella. Yeah. I just want to also note that my expectation, based off of what was said at tonight's meeting, is that there are going to be continued efforts at that. And I think that that's important, important for us to note and for staff to continue to follow up on which I know they will to to see how we can we can make the units as functionally as functionally universal as possible, even if it's not following the letter of our ordinance. Okay. Thank you. I'm prepared. Thank you. All right. Thank you. And Councilmember. So I guess your hand up. Great. Well, thank you. Just quickly, um, I will continue to vote no on this project for the reasons that I voted no before. Um, but as I was writing my notes with my head down, I do want to acknowledge that when Ms.. Kenny had to say was very powerful, some of the the the the the that her phrase is increasing profits on the back of the disabled community. Um, it's something that we shouldn't lose sight of. And I, and I know that this council won't do that, but, um, but as we go forward with other projects at that, that is something that keep in mind. So thank you. Thank you. And Councilmember Odie. I'll also be brief. And just like Councilmember de Song, I also write down notes with people's names and what what they say. So I because some of them I want to refer to later, later in the discussion. But, you know, like you, Madam Mayor, I had a read this a couple of times to really digest it and again. Right. Yeah, it didn't really sit well in the beginning. But you know, after speaking with Mr. Thomas about it, um, and also understanding that, you know, this has Mr. Thomas said this was a project that originally was approved in 2011, so nine years ago. I do want to say that both works people know. Uh. If we approve this, it's, you know, another example of this council turning the page from the years of litigation. And I appreciated the comments by Ms.. Armstrong, and I'm going to trust that they're sincere and that they will continue to work with our staff because, you know , I know I have turned the page on the relationship with ThoughtWorks and I think our city has done a good, a good job doing that. And you know, one good faith effort should be responded to in kind by another good faith effort. So I'm going to hope we can't pin them to anything, but I hope that they will continue to talk about this in good faith. And that's really all I have to say. Thank you, Councilman Brody. All right. Everyone spoken who wants to speak? And I, too, believe that we we in the works are turning the page together. And I think that there's so much potential and soon to be realized. So with that, we've had. Okay. I forgot who moved, who seconded. I realize you're not quite right. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, more coffee? Okay. Maybe we have a roll call vote, please. Councilmember de SAG. I know. Not quite. Hi. Odie. Yes. Bella. Yes. Mayor as he Ashcraft. Yes. That carries 4 to 1. All right. Thank you. And thank you to all of our speakers and staff. Let's work and let's go. Okay, so we are to keep moving. Counsel, it's almost 9:00, but you are doing well. We've covered a lot of territory and we're moving on to six D Madam Clerk.

The committee recommends the bill passes amended. Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you, sir. This this legislation is in and related to a CSO project in Ballater, a combined sewer overflow. The in this area of Ballard, there's a combined sewer system, which means that the stormwater runs into the sewer system. What that results in is in heavy rain events. It can overwhelm the sewer system, at least temporarily. The solution to this, and we're in our consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency to deliver this in the next, I believe ten years is a combination of green stormwater infrastructure. So how we develop on the streets to capture that water and treat it naturally and also storage facilities. This specifically is a storage facility, the shape of the storage facility. This tank is essentially a tunnel that runs from Balad to Wallingford and it'll hold water and major rain events and delay the delivery to the sewer system until the sewer system has time to treat it. The majority of this tunnel is built under public right away, but there are a couple of parcels where a couple private properties that are affected by this.

Mr. Clark, let's move on to the bid to commission appointment item. So let's start with item 19, please. Item 19 is a communication from Councilman Super, now chair of the Government Personnel and Election Oversight Committee. Recommendation to receive Charter Commission appointment and reappointment approved by the Government Personnel and Election Oversight Committee. Thank you. I'm loving our new committees already. Doing all this. Doing all this great work. Controversy or not? Do you have a motion on this being supported by the committee? I'm sorry, Miss. May I have my sticky mute button again tonight? So no problem. But let me get up. Okay. Okay. Can you. You can hear me now? Yes. Yes. I just wanted to make sure I know this is coming from your committee, so I just wanted to make sure that you had put the motion to approve. Absolutely. I apologize for the audio problems, but yes, that is the most. Okay. Thank you so much. And then we have a second. So thank you. I can't remember. Want to just go ahead and thank the committee for moving forward these charter commission appointments. And I just want to briefly just mention who they are. I want to start by going through these new appointments. On these new appointments, we have the two for the Citizen Police Complaint Commission, the PCC. The first appointment is Irma Archuleta. Irma Archuleta is a Council District seven resident and she has a long and distinguished career in education. They really focus on outcomes for historically underserved populations. She served as a trustee of the Lombard City College and also was a former vice president at a community college and a longtime educator and advocate within the city. She has really focused her work to help immigrant students and has held numerous leadership roles across the region. And she's really committed to, of course, serving Long Beach with her experience. So congratulations to Ms.. Archuleta. And then also we have Melanie Von Melnick is a resident of Council District six and has served in the lobbyist community for over 20 years, most recently as a member of the Long Beach Human Trafficking Task Force. She's organized numerous fundraisers and community service events and also works with a lot of social enterprise programs that also works with artisans in Cambodia to implement fair wages and programs to empower families and learn skill sets to survive. And so they're going to both make wonderful additions to the PCC and I want to thank them also to the Civil Service Commission we have. Yvonne Wheeler. Yvonne is a Council District eight resident and she has dedicated her career standing up for workers. She currently serves as a worker advocate in her role as national representative for the American American Federation of Government Employees. Prior to this role, Yvonne served as an area field services director for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. Asked me where she worked with over 82 local unions and has been very active across the city and in numerous organizations. Also being appointed tonight to the Parks and Recreation Commission is Charlene Higa. Charlene is a resident of Council District five and a lifelong resident of Long Beach. She attended all the U.S. schools and is now an English teacher at Jordan High School. She has been teaching in North Long Beach since 2014. She strongly believes in multiculturalism and diversity, that their strengths within our city and really hopes that her experience in the classroom can even break more barriers on questions around equity and access for everyone. So she'll be a fantastic addition to Parks and Rec. And then to add to the KPCC, we are also doing a re-appointment of Dan McNish, which will be her second term. So those are the charter commission appointments. And with that, I want to thank everyone with that on the committee for moving these forward. I don't think that we do that. We have any public comment on this item, but we do have council comment. And so first up, I have a councilwoman as in the House. Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to congratulate each and every one of these very impressive residents of Long Beach on their appointment tonight. Thank you so much for wanting to serve on these very, very, very important commissions. And. And best of luck. And I know you are going to bring so much value to this commission. So thank you very much. Thank you. Councilor Marie Ringo. Thank you, Mary. And I, too, want to lend my congratulations to the community members who have stepped up to volunteer on these important, very important committees for the city. So I want to congratulate them and thank you for their community service. Thank you. Vice Mayor Richardson. Just want to chime in. A great group of appointees on this list. And the next list, we're here. Congratulations to all of you. A lot of great north lobby folks that we see involved and look forward to welcoming you into these new commissions. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. Thank you. Very excited about our new fifth district commissioners. I'm proud that they are getting an opportunity to lead and be on a charter commission. It's not often that these change over. So we're really excited for the great work that you're going to do. Thank you. Thank you. With that roll call vote, please. Councilwoman Cindy has. All right. Councilman Allen. Hi, Councilwoman Price. Hi. Councilman Sabina. I sent a woman manga. Councilman manga. Councilwoman Sarah. I Council member Oranga. Hi. Councilman Austin. Hi. Vice Mayor Richardson.

Madam Secretary, please put the first item up on our screens. And Councilmember Flynn, go ahead with your comments on Council Resolution 1057, please. Thank you, Madam President. It's not often that one would call out a subdivision plat for a comment or for any notice at all. But this one I wanted to call out especially to thank the staff at Department of Transportation Infrastructure for working with my community on the Loreto Heights campus redevelopment. There were seven streets. If you look at the plat, you'll notice that are entirely internal to the campus. And so we worked with Dottie and the city surveyor and the staff there to impress upon them that it was not crucial to follow the the Denver street grid rules. You know, we're alphabetical, etc. These streets are entirely contained on the campus. There were seven of them. The streets that exit the campus on the federal course have Amherst, Bates and Cornell and Dartmouth as they because they intersect with a with federal boulevard. But inside the campus we were able to name seven of these streets with legacy names from the history of the Loreto Heights College and the Sisters of Loreto. And it is one way to recognize the historic nature of this site for 100 years and more. So when people enter the campus, they will see the historic ties to the Bonfils family here. For example, Sister Pan, Croatia, Mother Pan, Croatia. Bonfils, who is buried on in the cemetery on this site, was a cousin to Frederic Bonfils, the founder of the Denver Post. Frederick Bonfils is one of his daughters. May or may Bonfils Stanton endowed several of the buildings on the campus, the theater and the library. And so and Bishop Matchbook, who brought the Sisters of Loreto up here from New Mexico back in 1864 to start Saint Mary's Academy, which which developed in Loreto Heights. So we have match above way, we have Bonfils way, we have pan creation lane, we have Loreto way, we have a street named for the sister of Loreto who was the last sister who held that position as president of the college. My sister, Mary Francis Walsh, I think for 20 some years and one street named after a fellow named Max de Giulio who made who elevated the performing arts curriculum. ADLER At a height to national stature back in the sixties and seventies through the the Mae Free Standing Theater. And so I just wanted to call that on and recognize the willingness of of Dante staff, particularly our our departed manager, Ulysses Lee, who made the decision to allow this and to work this through the council process. And I recommend this to my colleagues for approval. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. All right. Seen no one else in the queue. That concludes the items to be called out.

Agenda item 12. Cancel Bill 119 635. Relation to the Satellite Department and the Office of Housing. Transferring jurisdiction of the former loyal heights and finished substation properties from the City Light Department to the Office of Housing for the purpose of developing permanent, affordable home ownership. The committee recommends the bill pass. S member skater. Thank you, Mr. President. This is the grand finale to the grand finale of City Light bills and efforts coming out of the Housing, Health, Energy and Workers Rights Committee. This legislation and the subsequent housing that will be built as a result of this legislation really stems from the work that you all supported last year. The two pieces of legislation that I sponsored in 2018 that said, if we have surplus property in this city, whether it's at Seattle City Light or any other department, we should be maintaining that land in public hands at the city and building affordable housing on it. We were able to do this because of the work of the state legislature who passed in 2018 House Bill 2382, giving Washington the jurisdiction to express it or the express authority to sell, transfer or lease public surplus property at no cost or low cost to other public entities for the purpose of providing affordable housing. So I want to thank represent a review of speaker former speaker Frank Chopp, who led the efforts on this. And we know that this is critically important right now as we think about the overall cost of land in this city continuing to skyrocket. There is a premium on Seattle's real estate market, and the ability to convey underutilized public land removes a major barrier to the creation of affordable housing and community driven development, to the tune of about a 15% reduction in the cost of terms of overall construction of housing. When we build on publicly owned surplus property, we're helping to maintain keeping land in public hands and meet the city's growing need for more affordable homes, reduce displacement and help address the affordability crisis that many of our families are facing. I'm really excited about this piece of legislation in front of you, and I think that it is important to note where these parcels are as we think about increasing access to high opportunity neighborhoods. The sites include Phinney Ridge and Loyal Heights. These are currently vacant, unused parcels of property in access to high opportunity neighborhoods. So think about bus lanes and schools and child care and parks. This is really an area that I think if we get more folks, the ability to live in these neighborhoods and for example, here have permanently affordable home ownership opportunities, we're creating a true transformation in our city that reflects the values of the original intent, which was to help more people be able to stay in the city, to have affordable options and ideally be able to have a smaller commute to their work or to have greater stability in their community overall. We also know that it's not just about where you live and getting from your workplace to home. It's about access to childcare and health clinics, libraries and so much more public spaces. We have deliberately been working through the Office of Housing to make sure that as we create additional housing opportunities, we are looking at helping to serve those who are most at risk of displacement through affirmative marketing and community preference policies that we also included in the disposition policy. This is a really great opportunity for us to basically there's two pieces, two parcels here. One piece relates to City I'm sorry to one. One thing that we're doing is moving land from the city of the city of Seattle City Light Department to the Office of Housing. And we're going to be partnering then when the land gets transferred to Office of Housing with Homestead Community, Land Trust and Habitat for Humanity to invest in creating at least additional 19 condominiums in Finney Ridge and eight family sized townhomes in Boyle Heights. These properties will allow for us to create more homes that will be brought online faster at lower cost, and allow the public investment to be spread further. Thank you again to the partnership of the Washington State Legislature for expressly saying that we have this authority and people questioned. And in the past they passed House Bill 2382 to make it very clear. And here we are at the city of Seattle, the first city to pass in the legislation the ability to transfer land, low cost or no cost. And here we are now. The first city again to enact the tenants of that House bill that sent that state bill and to make sure that we actualize creating affordable housing throughout Seattle. So I'm hoping this is the first of many and really excited to see the disposition policies coming into fruition and action here. Thank you, Casper Macheda. Any questions or comments? If not, please call the rule on the passage of the Bill. Skinner, I O'Brien. Pacheco. I so want I. Bagshaw. Hi. Herbold. I worked for President Harrell High eight in favor and unopposed.

And that takes us to item eight on today's agenda. This is proposed motion 2019 476, which would approve the initial framework for the King County Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation Inclusion Task Force as required by earlier motion, which established the task force. Jeff Mumm will offer a brief staff report and when you're ready, invite panelists up and we'll proceed. And as we begin, I want to acknowledge and apologize and acknowledge that you've been here for a full 2 hours of committee hearing. Appreciate your being here through this. And even more so appreciate the work that you're bringing to us today. Is it Councilmember. Lambert? Thank you. Thank you. I just wanted to say that I won't be able to hear your presentation in total because I have 75 homes that are in trouble right now. So I will be leaving. But I want you to and I'll be watching it on tape. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I heard the request for a brief briefings, but I will be brief. So, for the record, Jeff, ma'am, counsel, central staff, before you is motion 2019 0479, which would improve an initial framework for the County Gender Identification and Sexual Orientation Inclusion Task Force. The Staff Report, which was authored by Sam Porter, who can't be here today, is found on page 15 of your packet in. And to be brief, the framework is in compliance with the with the initial council motion 15162 which the Council adopted to establish the task force. And it lays out a timeframe, a goals and a budget for the task force to do its work over the next year. And I think the major or not the major the the one issue I will highlight is in the budget implications. The task force, the second 2018 omnibus budget included expenditure restriction within the Office of Performance Strategy and Budget for 100 and $100,000 to support the task force work and the budget outlined within this document and ranges between 175,000 and $240,000 to support the work. And that would be for a consultant to hire one term limited position. And then the support honorarium of $100 a month for task force members. The executive has stated that they don't intend to seek additional funding to support the task force. So it's so I'm assuming in the executive staffing speak to this more that they would absorb those costs within the department. And that concludes the the very brief report. I think you wanted to save time to hear from the task force members themselves. Very much so. See no questions of Mr. Ma'am. I invite the members of the Task Force Forward. And while they don't have a complete list, I also know that at least one of your members seems to have had to leave, I assume, due to the due to the hour. So. I apologize again. And we have the Mr. Members stood up with the chair at the end as well. Good afternoon and welcome. Thank you. Terry McDermott and members of the Council. And my name is Kelly McDermott. I work on external relations in the executive's office, which means I have the pleasure often to work with our community partners and different taskforces and community engagement opportunities. I prefer she and her pronouns and I am the Deputy Director of External Relations in the exact office that Jack Kennedy can go quiet askance. A la de Channel E Jen. My name is Samantha Bhaskar from the Haida Conquer and Inupiaq nation. And I'm here. I prefer she here, her pronouns as well. And then I'm here with Na Elihu friend as their community engagement specialist Inc. Hello, Honorable Council members. And I tell you what. Waiting is not a problem when real democracy is happening. So thank you, Marsha Boxer. She and her Ingersoll gender senator Martin Luther King County Labor Council, the new Washington State LGBTQ Commission, Equal Rights Washington. But so honored to be a part of this project that we're going to present today. Tal Afar. Armenia is a society for Hanon and thank you for having us today. We're really honored and humbled to be here. Pronouns are she her and so one feminine pronoun. And I'm here on behalf of Pride, Foundation, Utopia, Seattle, Trans Women of Color, Solidarity Network and the Washington State LGBTQ Commission. Thank you. Good afternoon. Steven Sawyer, executive director of Spokane, formerly known as People of Color. Against AIDS Network. Also with the State Western State LGBTQ Commission. Thank you. Great. And we'll be brief, but we wanted to take a minute to talk a little bit about the process that led us here today. And I will just say we had three long, wonderful task force meetings that went into the creation of the document in front of you, the initial framework. And we took time to educate and become educated about the work programs and lines of business for each county department, agency and branch of government and separately elected office, which was incredibly helpful to help the task force and winnowing down and determining particular areas of focus for the work ahead. We had a meeting after we transmitted the framework with council members Baldacci and Cole Wells to talk about the budget request. And Jeff was correct that we did make a compromise around executive staff sort of subsuming the role of in place of hiring a TLT to liaise with county departments. And we've worked to identify a roster of points of contact in all executive departments so that when the work kicks off, once we've onboarded our consultants and sort of rebooted in the second phase of our work, that will we'll be able to really easily and quickly respond to the task force's needs as it relates to departments in separate and separately elected offices. And we just want to thank the Council for their unanimous support of the budget request. We are looking forward to the work ahead. And now I'm going to pass it on to Samantha and Steven to talk a little bit about the different elements of the initial framework, including our inclusion of a land acknowledgment at the top of the report, as well as the guiding principles focusing on equity, intersectionality and the centering of impacted communities in the work ahead. Thank you, Kelly. As I said before, in my language, my name is Samantha Basco here at Na Elegy Fund. I was really intent on including a land acknowledgment in our body of work, not as sort of hollow words that make documents and meetings longer, but rather as an opportunity for us all to ground our work in this place and with each other. So I really and truly believe that land acknowledgments are an opportunity and a responsibility to one another and to this land and the people who are here first to work with each other for the care of. The land and each other. I really believe also that a land acknowledgment is sort of the beginning step. It's definitely not the end step. And that with land acknowledgments, it's sort of the opening. To a dialog in which we make sure that Native American people are included at the table on which our land, our culture, our traditional knowledge and our labor helped build. I believe that in our. Culture, in many Native American cultures, there is a. People we call to spirit, people who are diverse in gender expression as well as sexuality, and they hold a very honored and special place in our culture. They are celebrated. They are who we traditionally have gone to in both times of peace and war for advice and counsel and who have unique gifts that they give to community when they feel safe and welcome. And so it is within this work that we really wanted to ground that opportunity for education and learning among each other and look to all marginalized groups within this county to really make them feel secure, welcome and included in our body of work so that they can feel safe and welcome enough to share their gifts with us. Thank you. And just to. Talk about the social justice and equity piece, you know, so often as the executive director of okay and I'm talking about social justice and equity as we do work. Broadly in the community, but we've always. Still had a focus around LGBTQ issues as well. And it's incredibly important that we think there are folks. That are marginalized, especially our trans women of color. You know, African-American men who have sex with men is very. Important to kind of center this work around that. Oftentimes they don't get a voice at the table. And so they're creating this. By creating this, you allow them to have a voice at the table and have some buy in in the process of government, which is very key and important to this work. Okay. So beginning my activism in the late sixties and moving to LGBTQ issues in the mid seventies and focusing on trans sense, I have to say this is a real moment in history and you are making this moment happen and we're doing the part. I wanted to let you know about what we're doing with this task force, what this project is. We're making sure that we're contacting those folks who can really help us do the right thing and the right job. So specific groups that we have identified there in the list, of course, but let me just mention a few. We're definitely now aware, thanks to the work of this task force in our meetings, that the Department of Community Resource, Human Resources, Department of Public Health, Adult and Juvenile Detention and many others are departments and areas we need to talk to to make sure that our project around gender identity, around sexual orientation is understood not only in those departments, but what they can tell us how to do it. We've we haven't just conjured up we've worked to make real engagement strategies that we have, for example, focusing on the key stakeholders. We ourselves, we know many of those folks, but we don't know them all. Although the work of this this taskforce has indeed shown us some other partners that we are definitely going to include. We're also going to create an online tool. No, no surprise there, but we will definitely have that for a public commentary. We'll have our materials up for us to see. It'll be there for us in the way that it is done these days. Very different than it was in the sixties. Let me tell you, we are going to invite county staff, clients, experts, anyone that has been identified to us to join us, to help us. And then finally, we are fully aware of organizations, other organizations that we need to connect. For example, Immigrant and Refugee Commission is one that we will want to talk to, have been talking about and to and so many others, our Community Policing Commission, disability rights and so on. We have the large list. We are aware we will contact. We will do the work. And many thanks to you. And we're really grateful that you've all approved the budget around Ontarians, and it's something that's been tricky to talk about even with the other commissions at the table. And and it's really important that we honor the work of community organizers, right? As Council member Buttigieg said before, this is a community investment. Right. When we leave our jobs, we the work doesn't stay there. We take it home. And we work to keep our community safe and to build stronger relationships and keeping those communities safer. So and also I just want to mention that when we're not doing when we're here as part of the task force, every for every $100 that's awarded by a foundation to LGBTQ communities, we get about $0.28 of that. And it's even less for trans communities, it's about $0.03. So it's really important that we seize this opportunity to do something different, to honor the work of organizers like Marshall, who's been doing this since the sixties for free and for a lot of marginalized communities and for a lot of black indigenous people of color, we've always done things for free and it's time to do something different. So I think. And to close. I'm happy to talk a little bit about what's next. Next steps for the task force. So we had our I worked with our procurement department and our RFP for consulting services for somebody to come and help facilitate to help us facilitate and work with the exact staff on community engagement and to write our final report. That is the recommended strategy as well as a set of recommendations for how we might be a more inclusive government when it comes to different gender identities and sexual orientations outside of dominant narratives. So that bid is closing next week and hopefully we will have somebody on board at our next task force meeting is in the building on February 26. That's open. So if you want to attend or send your staff or let your constituents know and please feel free to do so, I'm happy to send information to any offices. And additionally. So with the proviso on the honorarium funds in our initial framework, we said we wanted to disperse the funds on a monthly basis, but the proviso asks us to take a look at how we might bring honorarium to scale for efforts such as this moving forward, where we're really asking folks who represent or work with marginalized communities to step away from their regular duties and come and help us out as an institution. And so a small committee of task force members is going to be working with executive staff and folks from PSB, the Office of Equity and Social Justice, as well as our Boards and Commissions liaison to develop some processes and protocols about how we will disperse honorarium and what it might take monetarily to bring it to scale for these types of processes moving forward. And with that, I think we're happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you. I think that a land acknowledgment is indeed a first step and an important step to recognize a community that stewarded and cared for these lands for so long and has the wisdom to recognize unique people as being as perhaps having unique contributions rather than to be other than shunned as so many other communities have. Thank you. And talking about a ability to evolve in time. Marcia is a woman ahead of her time. Marcia has started with bullhorns and organizing and today is not afraid of organizing with websites and social media. The report and speeches don't follow Marcia at a podium as Councilmember Dombrowski I know very well. But the work that you've all collectively come together to do on behalf of the county and people of the county is really essential. Thank you for bringing this up to us and for the work that you're prepared to do for the rest of the year. In your report, you lay out an ambitious set of work for which I'm very appreciative. Questions come. Councilmember Up the Grove. Thank you, Mr. Chair. More of a. Comment, if that's okay. I11 is I will not rule you out of order. Why, thank you. I missed the day of the media. I would suggest maybe just shoot it off to all the council members offices. That would be great. Also, what you said. About Marsha, that, you know, it's a sign of how far the movement have come that you're now with. Was it generations aging for pride as once as the young leader. But I think we all stand on your shoulders and the work you've done. May I come in? I think everyone for these exceedingly kind comments, and for me, it's just such an honor to be with my compatriots who are taking us not only through this stage with you, but to the future. They are the ones carrying us to the future. Definitely. And the. I also wanted to thank you for, as you said, centering equity. You know, I as a I'm a gay man, I marginalized to some degree, but I'm a man and I'm white and I'm financially stable. And that's a very different experience than a low income trans woman of color. But I think building those coalitions and speaking as one is important, and that only works if we put. Equity at. The center of that. And so I. Appreciate that approach as you. Move forward. And then finally, one little as you're doing your work and your relationship building with other organizations, I wanted to share with you a a little victory that. You might be able to plug. Into if you hadn't heard about. Our last county budget included a little bit of funding for our housing agency to do outreach specific to the LGBT community. And I'm I'm not sure how it's going to be administered they might be contracted was ally ship that had requested the funding and I assume they'll be involved in implementing it and there's an opportunity there, as you know well, that the transgender community faces unique challenges, even separate from gay and lesbian population in terms of housing discrimination. And we do have a few resources there and maybe be able to weigh in and help make sure that those are being targeted effectively and that the county's. Making good use of. That could. Be something that that task force could weigh in on or. Participate in. So I want to let you know that body of work was happening. Thank you, Councilmember Zala. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to thank you all so much for your work and for being powerful voices and advocates. The point you made about honoraria is so important because, like you said, so often black, indigenous, especially women of color, are expected to do work unpaid as expected to march and protest and organize on behalf of others unpaid. I would love it if you treated this task force as a model for how we can best engage community. So if you see other ways in addition to honoraria, in addition to be paid being paid things that we should do better as local government in engaging community and partnering with you. We would love to hear from you and using that as a model. Thank you. Councilmember Dombroski. Thank you, Mr. Chair. In a moment, I'll move adoption of the motion to approve the initial framework. But before I do. Earlier on in this hearing, I talked about a piece of legislation of which I was particularly proud. And the legislation that I wrote that commenced this work ranks right up there with that. I have not had the burdens and difficulties in my life that the folks in which were aiming to lift up with this work have. But you talked, Marcia, about an honor and a privilege do the work. It's an honor and privilege to get to just be a small part of the work that you're doing and all of you are doing. And to me, what makes it so special and important to me is it's about at its core, the dignity of the human being. It's a very emotional thing. The dignity of the human being coming to people and meeting folks where they are and who they are, and setting aside false constructs imposed by society. The history lesson that you reminded us of that this is just a rough go. I had a little sidebar that really it's a westernized contemporary imposition of these gender identities and that our first peoples aren't burdened by that. They had a more complex understanding and it is pretty powerful when you remind us of that, that just because things are what they are today, it doesn't mean that's what they should be or have always been. And so this work at its core to recognize, honor and respect the dignity of each person is what this is about. And I am so impressed with the seriousness with which you have undertaken the work, the thoughtfulness, the way you're in, the depths in which you're going. We have almost 15,000 people here at King County working every day. We come in contact with hundreds of thousands, maybe over a million people a year. We have two and a quarter million here in the county. But delivering these vital services and how we treat not only our own folks, but the public that we're dealing with is really a foundational principle. And when we look at this, we realized we weren't doing all that we could or should be, and your work is going to help us get there. I think it'll take some time, but I am excited that the policy leaders here in the government are open and willing to learn from you, the experts , to take your advice and follow your leadership.

You know, I want to thank Mr. Copeland from the Long Beach Health Department for sending a memo this afternoon regarding the existing effort, you know, of the health department. But they're the things that our health department has a plan. St Mary Medical Center has a plan. Mama has a plan. But what new threat? What I am asking for today is that they have department work with other city departments, such as the fire department, as well as the local hospitals, so that we can all be prepared for this worst case scenario. And we need to know what to do under these new threats. And we must have a training drill. I have seen when the flu season comes up in the morning, fear that needs to be addressed as staff need to be trained and know the best plan to take possible work for our patients , just like the earthquakes with the tsunami. We need to train for the worst possible scenario. And with this new infectious disease, it is threatening us.

Have having worked on infectious disease policy. When I worked in South Kensington, London, in Parliament, I feel that this is one of the most important things a city can do for itself.

Councilwoman Gonzalez Thank you as well, Councilmember Andrews, for this. I think it is good to have. It's great that we have this comprehensive information, but something more centralized that incorporates all of our departments is important, especially because enterovirus, we have all the Ebola scare going on. I mean, this is a really relevant issue right now. So thank you very much. Thank you. Councilmember Ringo. I was at the Health Department when the. We had the N1, H1 disease going out there. And I was very, very pleased with the response of our health department and our and our first responders as far as how they tracked it and were able to prepare our response for it.

Thank you, Vice Mayor Lowenthal. I know that the staff had presented in their outline some recommendations, and I'm wondering if the authors are asking for staff to include what they've outlined in their memo in in this plan. I'm not sure if it's a recreation of what staff's done. Can I ask the authors? So I knew that. Just to be clear, I know that the staff outlines in their memo a response to several different types of health emergencies, and they believe that their protocol will cover the intent of the request for an IDP. So should that be part of it? Is that the intent. To one of the authors want to comment? Councilmember Andrews. Yes, and that is part of it, if that's what you're asking. That is part of it. Okay.

And adding a new Chapter 21.53. The company recommends the bill pass. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Peterson, you're the chair of the committee and are recognized in order to address this item. As you council president item seven on our agenda, the council bill 119895 and item eight and the resolution that we're going to vote on next, they go together as part of Seattle City Lights, efforts to expand electrification, as part of broader efforts to meet and preferably exceed goals in our city's climate action plan. Seattle needs to continue the hard work to address climate change and owning Seattle City Light enables us to expand opportunities to use clean hydroelectric power to decarbonize our economy, including throughout our transportation systems. Adopting the Electrification Strategic Investment Plan will build upon the collaboration between our executive and legislative branches of government, which includes the climate. Note that we recently passed to consider all new legislation through the lens of climate change, specifically, council bill 119895 amends the Seattle Municipal Code to accommodate recent changes in state law, allowing electric utilities to incentivize and promote transportation electrification. This is similar to the incentives that Seattle City uses to provide or encourage customers to make energy efficiency and conservation investments in their homes and commercial properties. I can also speak to the resolution as well, but I can also hold that until we get to item eight. Right. Thank you. Let's go ahead and hold out until we get to item eight. So for now, we're just addressing the underlying bill. Colleagues, any comments, any additional comments on the bill? Customers want this. Thank you. My comments are regarding this agenda item and also the following one, because the legislation in the two items is connected. This bill and the resolutions the Council will be voting on next are the legislation that is legally required by the state before Seattle City. Life can provide financial incentives to switch from vehicles that burn gas and diesel to electric vehicles that can run off city lights. Zero emission hydropower. When you compare Seattle to be Light, our publicly owned and operated utility to Puget Sound Energy, the private for profit utility that sells electricity generated by burning fracked natural gas in the neighboring cities. It is a very clear example of why public investments in the Green New Deal are essential to address climate change. The for profit capitalist market will not solve the existential crisis of climate catastrophe. Satellite generates electricity with hydropower, including from generators that were built as part of the New Deal in the 1930s. We need that scale of investment again in recent years to be Light has had many excellent small scale conservation conservation programs. Light bulbs have been affordable in Seattle, largely because City Lights subsidizes them right from the store. City Light has programs to help Seattle residents investigate where in our homes we are leaking energy to incentivize commercial building owners to install energy efficient lighting and air and to protect habitat land. In Eastern Washington. In recent years, City Light has pushed the Port of Seattle to electrify the Port one terminal at a time, one terminal at a time, and has built 16 electric vehicle charging stations that it owns and operates in Seattle to date with four more on the way. All of this has been possible because City Light is a public utility and these bills for transportation, electric electrification continue that work. The part of parts of these bills that I am most excited about are the transitions of metro busses to electricity and electrifying more of the port. Both are things that City Light has already been working on, but I'm glad that they're continuing in these bills. And I really wanted to congratulate all the. All the individuals and organizations in the environmental and climate justice community who have been pushing on all of these fronts for years. I am disappointed, however, that the mayor's office has not invested in more real resources into transportation electrification in Seattle rather than just plans. These documents are only a general plan, and the next step from here would be to write an implementation plan. And then after that, there could be new investments. In fact, in the mayor's budget, she specifically calls out the small city like funds dedicated to transportation electrification, but completely glosses over the fact that the budget lines that include transportation electrification have actually been significantly reduced since last year in our budget. My office has asked city council and just Jeff to look into this in more detail because there are parts of that budget line unrelated to Green New Deal programs. So, you know, we will have more to talk about at that time. But some of it is the funding allocated to Green New Deal programs that have on balance being cut, not increased by the mayor and the new proposed budget. So I will be voting yes on the two bills containing this transportation electrification plan. This job at satellite are extremely thorough and competent and the programs they implemented are effective and they implement are effective. And I also want to thank them for engaging with my office and answering the questions we had for this legislation. However, I just wanted to register my disappointment that there is not more real investment by the mayor in actually implementing the plans in 2021. Acute. Councilmember Swan, for those remarks, are there any additional comments on the bill? Harry hearing none. Will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill? Get a. I. Peterson. I. The one. Yes. Strauss. Yes. Purple? Yes. Lewis. Yes. Morales. Morales. Yes. And President Gonzalez. All right. Eight in favor, nine opposed. Thank you, Madam Clerk.

Also, Councilmember Gonzales. Okay. So this resolution supports immigrant victims or witnesses of crime, as well as immigrant survivors of abuse and affirms the city's support and practices around asking about immigration status. It highlights the city's certification practices of what is in one key town called the I-9 18b form as part of an individual's U visa application to immigration officials. This resolution commits the city to working with trusted community based organizations to support outreach and capacity building so that individuals who aren't aware of the fact that they qualify for this type of certification are made aware of the fact that this is this is an option that is currently available to them in our community. I want to extend a big thank you to Appalachia, and we're up as well as we have. Yes. And Grace Wong for Lee for lending their expertize to us on supporting immigrant survivors and immigrant victims or witnesses of crimes. We have made some edits to this resolution to accommodate some last minute requests that we got from from community. And my office circulated those revisions earlier today before the noon deadline. So I think before I make any additional comments or others make additional comments, I would like to first move to amend Resolution 31775 by substituting version two for version one eight and encourage my I would encourage thereafter my colleagues to support the resolution. It's been. Moved. Oh, so good move. We've got a substitute in front of us that's been moved and seconded. Any further discussion about the resolution as councilman regardless download it. Okay, why don't you continue and then move on? I would just say that in this climate where we continue to hear from our Department of Justice and the President, that that public safety is compromised by having undocumented immigrants in our community, that this resolution really affirms the fact that that is absolutely false and that we know that that there is a disproportionality in terms of the crime that is experienced by communities who belong to the immigrant and refugee community, whether they're documented or not. And one of the things that I will look forward to prioritizing in the next several months is work around making sure that the policies within the city are such that it makes it easy and seamless for victims and survivors and witnesses of crimes to be able to access the certification they need to be able to adjust their status. And I think this will be a huge help for domestic violence and sexual assault victims in particular. It is only fitting that we introduce and vote on this resolution today, as October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. And just some quick numbers that I wanted to share. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence Statistics say that every 9 seconds in the U.S., a woman is assaulted or beaten, and that one in five women and one in seven men have been severely physically abused by an intimate partner. The rate of intimate partner homicide is higher among marginalized populations than their white counterparts at the rate of two times or higher in terms of marginalized populations and the disproportionate impact there. So I just really am looking forward to connecting with community based organizations, doing this work to make sure that that folks who are survivors in our community, who are witnesses to crimes in our community, know that this is a service that the city can provide that will give them relief to be able to continue to remain in this country. And that we believe that that is a clear strategy for boosting up public safety within our communities, and we are looking forward to the passage of the resolution. Thank you. And for the comments, colleagues. So we've got before us two votes, if I'm not mistaken. When you do, it's been moved and seconded that we amended the resolution known as Amendments two or version two in front of us. All those in favor of that amendment please signify by saying, I. Think. Any opposed. So the amendment is adopted and now I would move adoption of resolution 31775 as amended for the discussion. All those in favor of the resolution as amended, please signify by saying. I. And I opposed the resolution as adopted and the General Senate resolutions.

Communication from Councilwoman Sauro Councilwoman Allen, Council Member, Your Anger. Councilman Austin recommendation to Recognize and Celebrate Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month. Thank you so much. I want to first thank Councilmember Austin for recognizing the Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month in the city of Long Beach for the last few years. And appreciate him passing on the mantle for me to introduce this item to lead on it. And I'm happy to have his support as well as council member Yuan Guy and Allen on on it. May May is Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage Month. Many will hear Asian Pacific Heritage Month. But the reason why I chose Asian Pacific Islander American is that oftentimes Pacific Islander are left out from being identified as Americans when they are as well. So that is why Asian Pacific Islander, American and the month of May was chosen to commemorate the emigration of the first Japanese to the US on May 7th of 1843, and to mark the anniversary of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad on May ten. And as some may know, majority of workers who laid the tracks were Chinese immigrants. And we certainly seen the heroic examples of what APIs have done to sacrifice their lives for this country, serving on the front line of the pandemic. Examples are that nearly 31.5% of them nurses have died of the coronavirus in the US are Filipino, even though they make up 4% of the nursing population and according to the 2010 census in the city of Long Beach, Asian makes up 12.6% of our population and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander makes up 1.1% of our population. And APIs have a rich history here in Long Beach from Japanese arriving in Long Beach in the early 1920. In the early 20th century, by 1907, almost 200 B.C. had established business here. But sadly, in 1942, the executive order of 999066 authorized by President Roosevelt, removed Japanese national and Japanese-American internment facilities, and most did not return back to Long Beach because of that. And that's why there's less than 1% of Japanese community members here. But the Japanese community centers still remain as well as Japanese Buddhist church. And we also seen a concentration of Filipinos in the west side of Long Beach because in the 1940s many were enlisted in the United States Navy, and that's the location of the naval ship. And an influx of native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders arrive in California in the 1950s after World War Two. And so after the war, it's brought many Pacific Islanders into Long Beach, as well as you've heard about Cambodians settling resettling in Long Beach due to evacuating the fall of Cambodia to the Khmer Rouge back in 1975. And why we have the largest Cambodian community. And today I want to make sure we celebrate by not only hearing from my colleagues, but also we'll be hearing from our diverse Asian Pacific Islander American community leaders and members as well. So I like to open up to my colleagues if you can't remember us and if you like to share some words as well as other colleagues. Well, sure. Thank you, Mr. Mayor and Councilwoman Sara. Dr. Sara, I appreciate it. It's I look forward to this time of year. Every year I wish we could be together to celebrate culture with food and and and, you know, fellowship with our AAPI residents and staff members here at City Hall. We have been recognizing AAPI month, Heritage Month since 2014. And, you know, I think it gets a better every year. This year is special because we have a Sally Sara on the city council and I'm very happy to pass the torch and pass the mantle for you to take over this during your tenure on the council. Obviously, the Asian-Americans have and Pacific Islanders have contributed so greatly to our city, to our country. And they are part of the fabric of our city with a significant population here and a very diverse population within the Asian community itself. You know, just a couple of the historical facts that we were able to pull up in the early 1900s. Terminal Island here had nearly 3000 Japanese American residents as part of a vibrant fishing village with dozens of Japanese owned stores and restaurants. And this community was tragically dismantled as groups of residents were taken into custody and placed into detention centers. During World War Two. Our Long Beach City has such a rich history with the Navy, and it was a major factor in the location of many, many Filipino Americans to our city. And according to our census data data, more than 14,000 Filipinos in Long Beach were born actually in the Philippines. And many people don't realize that the Filipino community was was very, very active and instrumental in our farmworker organizing the farmworkers with Cesar Chavez and the the No Graves campaign. That was that was Filipino migrants making that happen. A lot of of Latinos in the Central Valley. And today we have a significant Pacific Islander community, especially Samoan, in Target. There are also due to our naval ties in World War Two. In fact, some reports indicate that Long Beach has the second largest Samoan community outside of Samoa, only second to Honolulu to significant. We have such a rich diversity and we should continue to support and celebrate the diversity that we have. And when I look at the city council, I think it reflects our city in a big way. And so I'm happy to celebrate today. We should also celebrate our Vietnamese residents. Our long residents are Chinese residents are Korean or Indian or South Asian communities as well. It is a big continent. And, you know, there are many countries and many languages spoken there. And I would say much of that is represented and proud and much of that is represented here in the city of Long Beach. So those are my comments. Proud to celebrate Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and I look forward to us being together again so that we can enjoy fellowship with that good food as well. Thank you, Councilmember. I have some comments as well and a few others, but why don't we go to public comment? Do we have a public comment? And we'll come back to. Mayor. We don't have any of the callers on the line yet. We're getting them right now. If any of the other council members would like to speak. We're going to work on getting public comment callers in the meeting as soon as possible. Okay. Do any customers want to start with Councilwoman? Thank you, Mayor. Thank you very much. A big, big thanks to Councilwoman Ciro for bringing this item forward. I think it's very important. I am very grateful that we are able to celebrate our Asian and Pacific Islander American residents here in our city of Long Beach as we acknowledge the work ahead of us and all the things we must do to fully realize the equality and dignity of our AAPI, a neighbors. It's also so critically important that we take these opportunities to celebrate and lift the history and heritage of our communities. I think it is crucial and very important that we we definitely celebrate this. The city of Long Beach, as we know, is a very diverse city, and that is what makes us so incredibly strong. So with that being said. Very happy for this item to be brought in front of us and very excited for all the accomplishments and all the contributions that the API community has had in making our city such a success. And I'm so delighted that we get to celebrate them this this month. Thank you, Councilmember. And next up, I have councilwoman votes. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. I, too, wanted to thank Councilwoman Sara for bringing this item forward. I'm very happy and honored to support it and be part of a city that has such a rich and diverse make up. And I think it's wonderful. I cannot wait until we're back together again and able to celebrate some of the. Traditions of the. Cultures and the holidays and the dates of significance to our various communities in person and having them here with us at City Hall. So thank you very much, and I am honored to support you. Thank you. Next up, Councilmember Turanga. Thank you, Mayor. And I want to thank Customer Sorrell for bringing this forward. It's always a great pleasure to celebrate our cultures and as I look at our city council, we got had, I think what we said before, the most diverse city council in the country, if not the world. But I was here when the Cambodian. Individual Cambodians can't allow me back in 1978, when they first started coming here as a result of the Khmer Rouge. Would you call that broke the well anyway. The killing fields. There you go. And so, I mean, we need to celebrate that and more. And as a council member, Soros said, West Nile League is one of the largest communities of Filipinos in Long Beach in the area, and I'm very proud to represent that area. And I want to say is two words that the only two words that I know. So I might pull it up, but. Thank you. Next up is Vice Mayor Richardson. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. My colleagues said very eloquent statements. So I stand up. I'll stand with them on those comments. And I just would add that Long Beach is incredibly diverse. We love this city and every particular group in our AAPI community. If you think about the contributions culturally from music to dance to language lobbies would not be the same if it were not for the contributions of our AAPI communities. I happen to represent North Long Beach. This is an area with significant AAPI population Somalians, Cambodians and and we're all part of the same cultural tapestry. So I certainly wanted to just chime in and offer my support. Thank you. Councilmember Sol sorrow. Councilman Oscar. On this item. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Vice Mayor. And I'll let me just go ahead and just add another getting to public comment, folks. We are having some tech issues tonight in case it hasn't been apparent. And the clerk is also the WebEx system is having an issue with public comments, but moving folks over to, I think, another system right now and not all the mikes are working correctly. So we we'll regroup on on some of the some of the bugs. But want to just note that and just to speak to this, I want to just thank council and sorrow. But everyone who signed on and just add I think I've been comfortable and you said it best our our API population community our our neighbors and friends are some of the best things about our city and make it such a great important part of who we are and add to the diversity, to the culture, to the fabric of what makes one each, each. And so I'm just very happy to just add my support and thank you for bringing this. And with that, Madam Clerk, are we able to be able to get the public comment? Unfortunately, not at this time. If you'd like to move on, we may revisit this item and take public comment as soon as we get them on the line. We're not able to get them through right now. They are waiting patiently. Okay. Let me let me do this, because this this item actually had significant public comment, and it was the one of the only ones that did. So why don't we just we can just hold this item where it's at. We'll come back to it. If there wasn't any objection and do the public comment, we can pose kind of comment, council comment would be public comment and indeed vote on this item and listen to the objection to that. So we'll go ahead and do that. They will move on. Can I go back in the consent calendar? There was an item which was item 18 or I believe. And I want to make sure that councilman in the House wanted to pull that item from the consent calendar for whatever reason, did not end up on my call list. And so I want to make sure that we we do that. That could be an office mix up there. So I want to make sure that we do it the right way for her. For her, because you want to pull that and can we go ahead and reconsider item 18, no.",Recommendation to request the City Council to recognize and celebrate Asian Pacific Islander American Heritage month.,"Step 1 (Logical Reasoning):

And it's a test and a fix the seal of the city and county of Denver to this proclamation and that a copy be transmitted to the Denver Police Department. Thank you. Councilwoman Black, your motion to adopt. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that proclamation 18 dash 0555 be adopted. It has been moved and seconded. Comments by members of Council. Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. I am honored to have been asked to sponsor this proclamation, recognizing our law enforcement officers. They are the people who we all call when we need help or when we're in danger. And they risk their lives every day to keep us and our city safe. Today, their jobs are more dangerous than ever, and every day they are in harm's way. Too many have made the ultimate sacrifice. As I read in the proclamation, we've got three deputy sheriffs in the metro area who died in the line of duty this week. This year. I want to thank Michael Hess, who's with the Denver Police Museum and the Denver Police Foundation for working so hard to honor our officers and keep their memories alive. I had the honor to attend the memorial for Officer Willie O'Steen this winter at Riverside Cemetery. Officer Steen was a World War One veteran and the first African-American officer to be killed in the line of duty in Denver. He was buried in an unmarked grave after nearly 100 years. A gravestone was finally installed because of the police museum to mark his grave after almost 100 years. I also want to thank our current law enforcement officers. My district is in District three and I am in awe of our extraordinary commander, Meghan Dodge, and all of her team in District three. So I wanted to shout out to them. And also I'd like to acknowledge Chief White, who will be retiring as chief after serving our city since 2011. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to first ask that my name be added to the proclamation and also extend my thanks and appreciation to the families of the deceased officers who were named, as well as to all of the officers who were named that have received honors and to those who currently serve to protect our communities every day. I have a couple of grandkids that have gone into the Navy. They both signed up to be military police officers. I have a grandson in law who is a police officer in Wisconsin. So this profession, you know, hits very close to home and really understand the the sacrifices as well as just the day to day. I don't know. I guess uncertainties, for lack of a better word, that the families have to deal with everyday, just praying and hoping that their loved one is going to come home safe. And so for all of you who wear that uniform to protect the city and to just pay tribute to those who have come before you , I just say thank you very much for your service to our city. Thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. I am reminded every time we do proclamations like this of the officers who have paid the ultimate price, made the ultimate sacrifice, and to particularly remember the 30th anniversary of Detective Bob Walsh's death, I remember that one clearly. The entire metropolitan area, I think, watched that because I think it was the Channel four helicopter that was following that suspect. And he had carjacked a man and. I remember seeing Bob get hit by that car and. It was a terrible, terrible day in Denver. And. I it's just an honor to be able to say. 30 years later that we remember him as we remember all of these and as we remember the officer that Councilwoman Black mentioned who was not forgotten after more than 100 years. Our thanks. Go to the Denver Police Museum and to the Denver Police Department for making sure that they are not forgotten ever. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. I also wanted to just give my gratitude and thanks to the men and women in uniform, especially in our police department. I think there's some folks that are on a daily, daily basis. I run into them all the time. I see them. And every time I have the opportunity, I say thank you. And I think, you know, with. When you when you're a public servant in the capacity of these peace officers, are you going to see the. Too often you get you see the you see kind of like the bad attitudes that are out there in the public. You see, you deal with the rudeness. You deal with the things that a lot of people. Don't deal with on a daily basis unless you're in customer service. However. You know, it's so important for us to be able to and I encourage everybody in the public to do this. If you're watching this, either here in the chambers or on Channel eight, is to go up and say just to say thank you, thank you for your service to our city and go in there and stay safe. Right. And to be able to do that means a lot. And I know that because some of my two of my best friends in high school are are now in uniform. And I see them all the time. And I always think to myself, Man, I knew you were going to be a cop. You were pretty bossy, but. You always had a good year. And it's just there's no other way to sum up that public service, like like the men and women that wear that badge. Right. And I think there's something special there. And when the ones who have, you know, gave their last breath to protect the public and the safety of the public. And, you know, it's always important that we never forget them. I'm glad that we are. You're marking the places where the men and women have, you know, took those last breaths in that uniform and on our behalf. It's important. So thank you for doing that. I think that's super important that you do that for us. I think a lot of us in the west side of that, the memory and the celebration of the life of people who have gone before us is a big deal. Right. And so I think, you know, so kudos to that. Councilwoman, thank you so much for for bringing this proclamation forward. And, Madam Secretary, if you can add my name along with it as well to I don't think I responded in time. So thank you. Thank you, Councilwoman. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. See no other speakers. I'll just wrap us up by saying I can't say it any better than my colleagues have already. And I just want to add to all of our officers. Thank you. Thank you for everything. Madam Secretary, roll call. Black Eye. Flynn I. Gillmor, Herndon High Cashman. Lopez. I knew Ortega. SUSSMAN Hi, Mr. President. All right. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results. Tennis tourney is proclamation 555 has been adopted. Tell someone black. Is there someone you'd like to bring up to receive the proclamation? Yes, I would. Deputy Chief Matt Murray, please. And Michael Hess with the Denver Police Museum. I asked Mike to come up. I just think everybody sort of said it. But I want everybody to see that they have done some amazing work and been incredibly supportive and very, very busy week for Mike and for the foundation. And if you also notice tonight, the City-County building will be blue. And that's also a lot of their work and work for the city. But let me just start by saying this Chief White couldn't be here tonight. He is at the dentist. And, you know, I wouldn't normally point that out, but as council person Black said, he is retiring. And believe it or not, it's related to this that I want to bring that up. He was struck in the face as a young police officer in Washington, DC had lost many of his teeth and he's had dental problems for the rest of his life. And so there are many officers who, you know, carry the scars and the and the memories and the pain and the suffering that come with not just dying on the line of duty, but being injured in the line of duty and having to do that job. And Chief White's been the police officer for 46 years. So I do think we owe him gratitude. And I know he appreciates all of you and told me to not go too far with this because he wants to speak to each one of you before he leaves. And I'm sure he will do that. But for the department, I want you to know how much we appreciate it. I want to echo something Councilperson Lopez said. You know, this was a tough year. I would I had the honor to attend all three of the funerals for the deputy sheriffs. And you know, they were right in a row. It was really difficult. I won't lie. It's very hard. And these were all really young men early in their careers. And one of the things that struck me was just how good they were. Have you just left the funeral with a sense that there's a hole in this community because of the people we lost. All three were husbands. Two of them were fathers, very young, very energetic, and people that said the most amazing things about them. I mean, I would want all three of them to work in our department in a heartbeat. So we appreciate it. But but something Councilman Lopez said that I think is important as I left Colorado Springs and I talked about this this weekend, we it took an hour and 45 minutes to leave the parking lot. There were so many people. And so your thanks just means the world to us. I cannot tell you. It's far greater than any award, far greater than somebody buying you lunch. Somebody that comes up like a man did to me on the way down to that funeral and just says thanks just means a lot. It really means a lot. So I want to thank you for saying that, because that is true. That that's that's the greatest currency for a police officer. And then the last thing I wanted to mention is Councilperson Black talked about the different awards this year. And I do want to point out, because some people don't know and especially people at home, we instituted a new year award two years ago. Chief White did called The Sanctity of Life. And that gets missed. And I don't think a lot of people understand what that is, but it's part of this major cultural change that we've undergone. And it's a focus on preserving life and not awarding somebody for a heroic act where a life was lost. And, you know, not to say that that doesn't matter, but we want to focus on times that you could have used deadly force and you didn't. And there were eight people this year, given that award and that if you think about it, every one of them, their life was in danger when they chose not to use their service weapon and take a life. And so in Denver, we have some really good things happening. And I want to make sure people know that and tell you thank you so much for this proclamation and for for your continued support and for honoring the police department. So thank you very much.",A proclamation declaring May 15 as National Peace Officer Day and the week of May 15 as National Police Week.,"Step 1 - Logical Reasoning:

Rehabilitation appears one, two and three at Alameda Point. Do you. And then we have. So member de sog understand you pulled up pulled this. I pulled it. I remember already. Did you want to start then. I just wanted to hear the presentation and then I'll make a brief comment after the presentation. I'm. Good evening. Good evening, mayor and City Council members. I'm Nanette Mchunu and the Community Development Department. Also in Bay three is. So this study, let me tell you a little bit about peers one, two and three. In 2008, the city that our governing body initiated a study, a condition assessment report of peers one, two and three at Alameda Point. And at that time, the peer well, let me just say the peers were constructed in the 1940s. Peer one peers two and three are large, reinforced concrete structures originally designed for aircraft carriers. Pier One is a smaller steel and concrete cellular structure. And at that time, the majority of Pier One was in general good condition. It was built in 19, rebuilt in 1980. Pier two, which is what I call the workhorse of our piers, because it's used on both sides for most for the myriad ships. And it is heavily used. And this kind of. Can you show us with your pointer location? Sure. Let's see if this pointer works. We would dim the lights, but then a councilmember couldn't see. Yeah. Oh. So I think this is a clicker, not a pointer. There's. All right. I might need some technical assistance from the city clerk. Yes. This one? Yeah, I. We're not working now. Oh, sorry. We need to turn it on that now. How many city employees? Okay. All right, so I'm here, it appears. This is Pier One, the shorter one. This is Pier two with all the ships on it. So it's the workhorse. And this is pure three where Hornet also is located. Just for your reference. Thank you. You're welcome. So Pier three is actually in the best condition of all the piers. And it's sort of unfortunate because it's there and it doesn't necessarily take advantage of all of the services there. It could be since it's just a museum and it's not a working vessel. It it could you know, it's unfortunate that the ships these other ships are not being able to take advantage of it. So I'm the 2008 study gave us this assessment that the peers were in fair to poor or fairly good condition, depending on which peer we were talking about. And during that whole time we had been since then, we'd been really wanting to go deeper and figure out what we need to do to breathe new life in these pillars. We have a tenant and I'm here, the mirrored chips, which has about 15 more years left on these piers. And they are not doing so well because remember, this study said they were in good to fair condition in 2008, which was eight years ago. So the study that we're proposing to do tonight or we're asking your permission to find tonight is a let me back up a little bit that the 2008 report was a study that asked for more studies. And I'm I'm quite frankly, I'm kind of over those kinds of studies. And we really need a study that tells us what we need to do next. And as a city, we can't afford to wait to have 10,000 more studies to do. So the study that we're proposing tonight is the first in three phases. And so the first phase is to get in, get under the water, look at the piles, do some sampling. Tell us what the heck is going on down there, because we know that the piles underneath the piers are are damaged and there's some organic materials that are destroying them, which is not unusual for peat piles that age. And also, we want to know the next step. What do we do to repair them short of tearing them all out and rebuilding, which we don't have the money to do? What can we do to breathe new life into these piers for the next 15 years for myriad or longer? So the report that. But a group that we selected as BGH has a. Yes. Thank you. The city clerk is going to show you some pictures of our lovely piers from underneath the wharf. And Miss McNaught, she's pulling us up. Could you just remind us what Murat is and the importance of. Sure. Sure. The mirrored ships are the ready reserve fleet. They are in the Department of Transportation. They are not Navy ships. They are ships that were decommissioned and they inherited from the Navy. And they are deployed when there are natural disasters or a need for our country to respond. They were in Haiti during the earthquake. If there were if there were a huge earthquake and when there will be a huge earthquake in this region, the mirrored ships will play an important role. I attended a meeting with FEMA representatives talking about what's going to happen in the region. And the myriad ships were were. Key. To what's what will happen. And the fact that those ships are in Alameda really guarantees that goods and services will come to Alameda. So they're very critical to our city. Also locally, they ships alone represent roughly 6%, I think is the number of 6% of the energy consumed of all of Alameda, those ships alone. And also and I think and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you may know this, I think when California was having a lot of rolling blackouts, the ships were able to convert to their own power source to save the draw within our city. So they were able to they're able to be a large consumer that helps our city. And they also are able to support themselves, which also helps the city. Exactly. That's the punch line is they're a major revenue source for our Alameda Municipal. They're one of our largest tenants. Allow me to point the other important thing, which is kind of an intangible, is that they support a lot of the maritime industry in the Bay Area. A lot of the small welders or people who can can make things that you can't make find for these ships anymore are employed by Myriad to help keep those ships running. So they they are a feeder of other other businesses. Thank you. And could they also be used if there were a time when we needed to evacuate a large number of citizens? I would imagine that that would be a significant that would be a role they could play. I don't know if they would play it because they really are about staging. They're able to put together a hospital in a matter of two days. And so I think that if we were needing to deploy people, I think between them and the wider facility, that would be a way of getting people on and off that island. Thank you. I think the pictures are up. Okay. So I think we're just going to go. I mean, I don't there's nothing to really tell. It's just a visual about the pork. Maybe tell us what we're looking at. Okay. So these are some of the piles that are underneath there, underneath our our piers. You can see the concrete is not in the best condition and you can keep going. And then some of them, you can see that the corrosive material on the outside, you'll see below the water. A lot of them are just eaten away. And so they're not even connected to the ground anymore because of the the corrosive material. This is the concrete on the work. This is the material that kind of gets on there and the concrete on the wharf and the vaults they're cracking. And, you know, I think I remember council member matter. I see if I see your mattress, you won't say anything over the water just gets beaten. And and that's kind of what we're seeing here is that this concrete is completely compromised. You see a diver down there looking at like the this the deterioration of the concrete on the piles. Am so sorry stage is proposing to work 250 days on I on I study the first 100 there were going to be in the water testing getting samples you see the little have a corrosion has below the water really compromise the the piles. We'll be testing. And then they take the the test results and they compile an engineering analysis. And remember, we're not going to have a report that asks for other reports. And from that analysis, they are going to identify the deficiencies in our facility. At the end of the day, the city is going to get a product with recommendations for repair, a variety of repair schemes. So they're not going to just force us into one kind of solution. They're going to say, if you want five more years, this is what we do. If you if you need 20 more years out of this, this is what you should do. And so we can work together. It will be a process of developing a plan for those, Piers. And in addition, there will be cost estimates. We will have they will provide us with what they think it'll cost to do some of these repairs. Of course, we will bid it out and see what the market says, but we'll have some idea of what we're getting into. And we'd have to we'll have to find the money. But most importantly, as we put together this plan, they're going we're going to put together a priority list of what we really need to take care of and and move move forward to try to, number one, keep the mirrored ships here and support them and to provide them with a facility that meets their needs through the life of their contract and even beyond. If if we can negotiate that. Or and also to breathe new life into our peers that have not really had a lot of TLC since the eighties. So that's the that's the goal of this. You have any questions? Just one question. Can you kind of describe because I'm not sure if everyone understands how the sewage is processed on a pier currently. So Pier two had a major sewer line break. And the problem, as you can see, this picture kind of tells you the problem with a lot of the infrastructure on the piers is it's under the piers. And so there are not a lot of contractors who want to work under the piers. And so either we end up getting gouged because we can only find one person who can do the work or we have to piece it together and figure out what we're going to do long term. And so we actually bid this right now, the the the ships are they're equipped to be on sea. So they their sewage is in their tanks. And we are paying to have those tanks pumped out and the waste trucked out. I'm happy to report that the council approved a sewer replacement project which will bring the sewer sewer line above the pier, but it costs $1.4 million and the project will be completed next month. So we'll stop doing that. But that's the that's what's going on here, too, right now. Then just quick comments. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I pulled this because, I mean, to me, this is kind of like my little pet issue is everyone. When they take me around town, they want to show me their deteriorating Piers. So I I'm all in favor of this. I'm not going to vote against that. I didn't pull it for that. But I think it's important for people to see these pictures because they don't get an opportunity to see them like we do either in like a consent calendar or when we're going on tour. So if you go around town, it's not only Pier two, you go to Alameda Marina. You know, some of the wooden ones are like stalactites and stalagmites where, you know, they're not even touching each other anymore. They're so rotted out. The Grand Marina, you know, the owners there showed me their peers and wharfs are deteriorating. Alameda landing. So it's just to kind of draw attention to this issue and keep it on our radar that, you know, this is kind of a priority of mine to make sure we find a way to replace this crumbling infrastructure. So I appreciate your presentation and the pictures. Thank you. And that being said, could you explain the funding source? I'm sure this this project is being funded out of the Tidelands Fund. So it is these these piers are on the Tidelands. And so all the revenue that's collected from the Tidelands property has to be reinvested in Tidelands property. So this is a perfect use for those funds. Thank you very much. Any other questions or comments? Council members? We have a motion. You pull that, you make it. I'll move approval of the item. I'll second all those in favor. A motion carried unanimously. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now we move to six a. Adoption of resolution appointing a member of the Civil Service Board. And Ron Taylor is a member of the Gulf Commission. I know what you mean. I move that we approve the appointment as listed. Second. All those in favor. I motion carried unanimously. Thank you. And I want to thank Troy Ozma and Ron Taylor for stepping up.

It's maintaining the current. Got it. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Thank you. Counts member. All right. Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens, which is Resolution 99. And Councilwoman CdeBaca, this is yours as well. Go ahead with your questions. Thank you, Mr. Morel. Here. It's. Good evening. Members of Council Greg Moreau, director of Community Corrections. Thank you so much. Wanted to make sure that we get on record the timeline for the RFP that should be coming that should be should have accompanied the vote, but will be bumped out a little bit. Can you tell us about when the door for new providers in the community correction space is going to be open? Yes, Councilwoman. So we are currently working with. Purchasing and hope to have a procured procurement issued. In early March. Awesome. And are we? So with this extension of the contract and the future opening of the door for new providers. What what will allow us to determine when we end our services with core civic. If we don't need to go all the way to to the date that this extends it to. So what this extension. Does is give us the time to operate and sustain the current model. If through the procurement process, new providers are identified, as soon as they can step into that space, we can start to evaluate the need for beds at course. Of moving forward. And can you again on the record explain the ratchet down of beds that will happen before this contract ends? If I understand the question correctly so, the current. Average daily population is roughly 330 individuals. That number will extend through October 1st if this amendment is approved and then the cap will be at 250. Through June of 21. At some point on the back end of the contract will continue to ratchet down because you can't just get from 250 to 0 overnight. Awesome. Thank you. All right, Councilmember Ortega. Don't leave. So I just want to clarify a couple of things. So we've already purchased Tully Hall. And I just want to. Just in my mind, be clear about the process that Councilwoman CdeBaca asked about if that has anything to do with Tori Hall or if that is specific to the facilities that Core Civic is currently in by extending their contracts to remain there through the end of next year. So Councilwoman Ortega, the in the procurement process will seek to. Identify a new provider or providers of services for the newly hot site. In addition, we'll be looking for providers to submit proposals that would say we can. Offer these services at this location. So I think the locations of those new proposals are we don't know yet. We need to wait until those proposals come in. So the assumption is they'll come. Their proposals will include their own locations. No, not not these current properties that core civic is in. So their locations could include their own properties. You know, per the letter that was attached to this request. Of course, Civic has agreed to work with the city and give the city. You know, the first right to to negotiate for the lease or sale of their properties. But tonight's bill only deals with the operations, not any acquisition whatsoever. That is properties. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Kenny. Thank you. I actually just wanted to say thank you. During committee, we asked for some assurances that we'd have a chance to discuss the buildings should that opportunity arise and making sure they weren't going to be sold. And you provided such a letter and the company signed that letter as well. And so I just want to thank you for for providing that reassurance. And I'm going to be comfortable moving this forward tonight because I believe it's critical. I'll refer to my comments in committee about the critical nature of continuing to allow placements to continue and not losing important space. And we keep saying beds, it's really people. So to not lose people who may have to spend more time incarcerated before or may be released without supervision. Right. That's what community corrections is. It's extra supervision and support. So whether you care about the person, whether you care about the community, in both cases, I think there's some benefits to being able to continue this capacity without interruption. So I'll be very happy to see this go forward tonight. Thanks. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Hines. Thank you, Mr. President. So I'm not in the committee that is actively working on this. I'm not on safety either, the committee that this went through. So I apologize for my ignorance. You mentioned 250 beds by 2021. Our goal is not to exit completely by 2020 or June of 2021. Our goal is not to exit completely by June of 2021. So Councilman, if I can clarify. So the 250 is the number of placements or individuals that we would have downsized from 330. By October 1st. Through the rest of that period, which would end June 2021. Our goal would be to reach zero. Okay. Thank you. And I would echo Councilman, can you just point about these are people and we want to make sure that we protect people in our community. And so thank you for that clarification. I was concerned there for a minute, but I just misunderstood. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember said, can you back up? Yes, thank you. Just a request for our team. I don't think that the letter has been uploaded into the public facing system. And so if we could get that in there, I think it is very important to the public to have access to that.","A resolution approving an Amendatory Agreement between the City and County of Denver to be administered by the Department of Safety, Division of Community Corrections in consultation with the Denver Community Corrections Board and Corecivic, Inc. for residential and non-residential community corrections services.

All to provide additional paid parental leave, any new paid family care leave, benefit to eligible city employees, establishing other conditions of implementing the new leave benefits and ratifying confirmed research and prior acts. Thank you very much. Typically, this legislation would be heard by the Affordable Housing Neighborhood in Finance Committee, but we recognize that Councilman Gonzalez has put certainly a lot of energy and leadership behind this. So unless Councilmember Burgess has any objections, will defer to Councilmember Gonzalez, present this case. HUIZAR She have the floor. Thank you. This ordinance is an ordinance that would, if adopted, provide additional paid parental leave to qualifying employees, as well as adding a new paid family care leave benefit for eligible city employees. In a nutshell, what this ordinance does is provides employees who have been with the city for at least six months, 12 weeks of paid leave when they become a parent. That would include mothers and fathers, births, adoptions and of becoming a foster parent. In addition, it would provide additional time, a similar amount of time for paid family care leave as well. It does have a drawdown option. You heard Mr. Van Dike, Sean, from local PTA refer to this. The drawdown requires that employees use all but one week of their accrued vacation time and all but two weeks of their sick time. But I think, you know, in this in this instance, we worked very hard to try to make sure that all qualifying employees would have a guaranteed 12 weeks of paid leave under this proposal. And the ordinance that is before council to address one of the points that Mr. Van Dike meant made about the potential disparate impacts we had. I agree that we need to make sure that we continue to evaluate the impact and the benefit of our benefits under this particular program, and will continue to work with the executive to make sure that we do that type of study and evaluation to ensure that we are having the impact and the course that we intend to have, which is to really get at this issue around the gender equity issues that we see that women within the city's workforce currently experiences. So that's the basics of the particular policy. I think an important point of information under this particular ordinance is that it will be retroactive to January 1st of 2017. We have been in my office receiving inquiries from city employees about about that particular issue. So we ended our conversation publicly around paid family leave so that we can enter into negotiations with our unions before advancing legislation. And one of the critical pieces that we wanted to see out of the Labor Relations Policy Committee and for me personally was to make sure that there was retroactivity related to this particular bill so that we wouldn't be leaving employees behind as as we respected the collective bargaining process. And as we moved towards passing considering and ultimately passing this piece of legislation that is before us today. So this piece of legislation will be retroactive to January 1st of 2017, which means that if we have an employee who is who is a qualifying employee who would otherwise qualify for this program, that employee will be able to access the benefits that are being offered in the ordinance that we are considering today for passage. So with that being said, I would move for the passage of Council Bill 118910. Thank you very much. Has been moved. And secondly that any further comments or questions or concerns? Councilmember Swann. Thank you, President Harrell. Paid leave provides indispensable support and stability to working class families during some of the most important and trying periods, and are even more crucial to communities of color and the LGBTQ community, which are far more likely to be underemployed and or working in low paying jobs. The Seattle Women's Commission has reported that paid leave at the single most effective policy the city of Seattle can implement to advance towards gender equity for all workers. It also influences the amount of time that men spend on childcare and on household responsibilities. So I think it is it has a sort of hidden component as well that would be beneficial. And as the speaker from the Coalition of Unions spoke, there is a drawdown provision that workers could negatively that could negatively impact women. That is in this proposal. After using eight weeks of paid parental leave, a worker must drawdown vacation and sick leave banks to three weeks before accessing the last four weeks of paid parental leave. The coalition of unions is supporting it, but they have expressed their concerns that this means women who would more commonly use all 12 weeks of paid leave and that's borne out by data around the nation, would be forced to end up drawing down more vacation and sick leave than men in city employment. The city has agreed to study this and the unions have said that they want to revisit this in the new FT. Near-future to scrap the drawdown. And I must recognize that this is a good step forward. After the majority of the Council voted no on a proposal for 12 weeks that I brought forward for without a drawdown in November of 2015. So I'm glad that we're moving forward, but I think we should recognize the role of the movement in forcing the city to act. In addition to the proposal that we had fought for in November 2015, on July 30th, 2016, the Martin Luther King County Labor Council, the Coalition of City Unions and my office together hosted a town hall which brought together more than 200 people representing a powerful coalition of state and city unions, women's organizations, LGBTQ activists, social justice organizations, faith groups, and working people who came together to kick off a new movement for paid leave, both family and parental for all in Seattle. And it's the weight of this coalition and the solidarity that they have extended to City of Seattle workers, employees. That has kept the issue in limelight. The victories that are won by the city of Seattle employees will undoubtedly help us, in turn, to build momentum for paid family leave for all of Seattle's workers. Thank you, Councilmember Kasper. And show. Thank you. I want to say thanks so much to people that have worked on this. And I want to also add something to the record. Councilmember Sawant said that she brought something forward a year ago. Many of others of us have done the same thing. And last year we reached out to the mayor's office, to our budget office to say, how can we do this and how can we make it work financially? And that's what we did. And I really respect the fact that our coalition of not just labor workers but internally have come together to make this reality. And I want to thank all of those in the coalition that worked with us at the University of Washington to this past summer, where we brought people together, including our state legislators, to say we can move beyond just the city of Seattle, but we want it to be done and a statewide basis. So progress has been made. I'm grateful to all who have worked on it, and I want to recognize how many people have actually worked on it to bring it bring us where we are today. Thank you, Councilmember Bagshaw. Councilmember Johnson. Just briefly, is the person up here on the guys that probably most recently took paid family leave. I want to say how excited I am, but also many of my constituents are about the retroactive nature of this. I've received several emails from constituents who work for the city asking questions as their partners or they themselves are entering the final term of labor, wondering when this program that's been long discussed but has taken a little while to get to us is going to get implemented. So many of those folks are very excited for this day coming today and the retroactive nature of it being back to January 1st I think is really important for us. Alex. Thank you very much. Councilmember Herbold, thank you. Just a bit to add, I do want to thank Councilmember Swan for bringing this issue forward back in 2015. I also am glad that we have reached the point that we are at today. I do appreciate this version of the bill because it also includes not just parental leave but family care leave, which I think is incredibly important for the people who work for our city. Keep it running because not everybody has children, but many of us have to take time to care for a loved one. And I think that is another really critical piece of equity that is lifted up with this version of the bill. Thank you. Great comments. Any further comments from any of our colleagues? Councilman Gonzalez Just take us home. Jesse That's what I'm trying to do. So I, I also want to just express some gratitude primarily to somebody who isn't with with us on the dais anymore. And that's to Councilmember Jean Gordon, who who really was the first person to advocate for municipal policy at the city of Seattle to provide paid parental leave. And that's the reason why our current workforce has a base of four weeks of paid parental leave. And I think that this council has recognized that four weeks is was certainly a step in the right direction, but needed to be needed to be more. We all know the science behind the benefits of paid parental leave in states and cities that have paid parental leave. In California in particular, when they polled, when they did the polling, they showed that that 90% of businesses who have paid parental leave actually saw benefits rather than adverse effects related to paid parental and paid family leave policies. But I really want to thank Councilmember former Councilmember Gordon for her vision and her tenacity in fighting for gender equity at the city, including the inaugural policy of four weeks. And this is really building on her legacy by adding an additional eight weeks to paid parental leave and by adding in the recognition that a lot of our employees may not be parents but do do have significant needs and obligations and responsibilities related to taking care of sick loved ones. And I'm looking forward to having the passage of this happen and to make sure that we keep track of the data and the usage to ensure that we are using this policy in a way that meaningfully impacts gender inequity that we experience here in our city. Well done and good for them. Thank you for those comments. It's been moved in second with a clerk. Please call the roll out the passage of the bill. Johnson. I. O'BRIEN Hi. Sergeant Bagshaw.

Councilmember Sandoval, will you please put Council Bill one, three, two, two on the floor for final passage? Yes. I move that bill. One, three, two. To be placed on. Very final passage. Sorry. All right, we've got it on final consideration for passage. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for council bill one, three, two, two is open. And we're going to have the staff report here from Councilmembers Flynn and Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Councilwoman Ortega and I are very pleased to bring this forward for the last couple of years. Some of us have been discussing how best to recognize the contributions of Kathy Reynolds, Councilwoman Kathy Reynolds to this body, to this city, and to all of its people. And I think they are only regret is that she is not here with us any longer to see this happen. But I don't know if Councilwoman, if you want to make a few opening remarks. I just want to thank Councilman Flynn for working together in bringing this forward and reaching out to former colleagues, many of which are either here or online. That will be speaking to you shortly. But when we explored what made sense, naming the chambers was like the perfect solution to honor Cathy Reynolds. And it will be something that will, you know, last forever. I mean, this this building was built to last forever. And Cathy's contributions were just enormous. And we'll we'll walk through those shortly. Thank you. Before we get started, I do want to recognize one person here in the chamber that we haven't seen in a very long time. There are as many former members of this body who are here. But there's one gentleman here who served on the third floor for many years, and that is our former city attorney, Dan Muse, who is here with his wife, a SEAL Harmer. Dan, thank you for your service to the city. Dan was city attorney for many years under Mayor Wellington Webb and I spoke with him right before this. He said Cathy is just one of a kind and he's he's very pleased that council's taking this step. Let me tell you exactly why we have filed this bill and believe that this is something that ought to be approved unanimously. Up until 1975. No woman had ever been elected to this body. In the year 1975, two women were. Kathy Reynolds holds the distinction of having been elected first because the second woman elected that year. Kathy Donahue had a runoff. And so Kathy Reynolds was elected in May and Kathy Donahue was elected in a runoff in June in District ten, which I don't think was perfect at that time. Councilman Hines But but she helped to make it so and so. Two women took office that year sitting among 11 men. She was reelected a total of seven times. There are three other members of this body. Who have been elected seven times. One was the longtime councilman from what was then District eight and five points, and that's Elvin Caldwell. Councilman Caldwell, though, did not serve the entire 28 years. So Councilwoman Reynolds has the record of tenure. That is the longest. Councilman Caldwell was appointed during his seventh term as manager of safety by Mayor McNichols, so he resigned his seat during that seventh term. The other council member who served seven consecutive continuous terms is the gentleman memorialized on the plaque by the door into our office. And that's Paul Hensel, who served seven terms out of District four in southeast Denver. The other member of this council, who will have served seven complete terms, is standing to my left, and that is our councilwoman, Debbie Ortega. Councilwoman Ortega, Ortega's tenure is discontinuous. She served four terms until term limits took effect in 2003. And then, as we all know, she was reelected to this body in 2011 and is serving right now her seventh term and will be termed out at the end of this particular service. I mean, I think it is remarkable and very honorable of Councilwoman Ortega that while she will match Councilwoman Reynolds in years of service, she is a co-sponsor to this and is is fully supportive. I don't know, Councilwoman, if you want to make some remarks on that. So I just want to say I had the pleasure of serving with Councilwoman Reynolds. Alongside many of her colleagues who are here tonight. And she was an incredible individual who was a mentor to all of us, newbies who came on. When I got elected, there were four new council members and it was enough to sort of shake things up a little bit in terms of looking at doing things a little bit differently. But she truly was an individual who brought a lot of knowledge and was always willing to sit down and answer questions and just offer her wisdom. When I was struggling with with varying issues, we worked very closely together on a build out of the Central Valley. The Pepsi Center was in my district. She and I served on the committee together. And, you know, we'll talk more about her contributions. But it it is just an honor to be able to do this tonight and to recognize Cathy in this way for her many, many contributions to this city that will be in place for many, many years into the future. She, Kathy Reynolds will have the longest continuous service of any council member by a quirk of a charter. And as former city attorney muse may remember this, but after the 91 mayoral election and the very hectic runoff that year, that led to Mayor Webb taking office almost immediately after the runoff and not having the time that should be afforded to put together an administration. There was a charter amendment put on the ballot to push the inauguration back to the third Tuesday in I'm sorry, the third Monday in July. It used to be the first Monday in July. So Councilwoman Reynolds will have that record over Councilwoman Hensel on the wall over there, excuse me, by two weeks. During her tenure, Councilwoman Reynolds served alongside. 38. Different members of the council four times. She was elected council president. She actually served five terms because when Councilman Caldwell was resigned to become manager of safety. Councilwoman Reynolds had been pro tem and she became acting well. She became the president for the rest of Councilman Caldwell's year as president. Eight times she was elected as council president pro tem. Since the election of 1975, when council members Reynolds and Donohue became the first two women that seemed to open the floodgates for women in office. Here's one of the flood gates right here. And we have in seated in the audience, we have a number of women who were elected to this body subsequent to that. And I don't know if this was the appropriate time. Could all members. It is because I just said it could. All members who have all persons who have served on this body, please stand up and be recognized. Thank you. It should be noted, though, that Kathy Reynolds was not the first woman to serve on the body. I purposely put in the presentation first woman elected because of one of those vagaries of history. In 1935, as you can see in this newspaper article, who was there was Eugene Bartholdi from North Denver, who resigned. About. Four months before the end of his term in 1935. And Mayor George but goal appointed a woman, Elissa Paladino from North Denver to fill out the last four months of that term. And she did not run again. And I wanted to draw your attention to her quote at the bottom of that story. It says, You can bet Mrs. Paladino said, you can bet I won't neglect my cooking and sewing. I cannot imagine don't stab me in the back here. I cannot imagine those words being said to a newspaper reporter by Sal Carpio or Ted Hackworth or Paul Schwalm or Tim Sandoz. Right. Or who else is your Charlie Brown? Charlie Brown here now. So since that election go from 1979 onward, 31 of the 56 people who've been elected to this body since 1979 were women. A majority, 31 out of the 56 people elected to this body were women. This is crazy. I also want to acknowledge the men who are not here, who are no longer here, who Cathy served with. And that was Councilman Bill Roberts, Sal Carpio, Hiawatha Davis. Bill Zeigler. Elvin Caldwell. Sam Sanders. Ted Hackworth. Bob Kreider. Paul Hensel. Ed Burke. Joe Nolan. Larry Perry and Ken Macintosh. These are all you know, this was when it was predominantly a male body. But these are men who are no longer alive. And I wanted to acknowledge them. Thank you. So I want to go on to some of the policy initiatives that we believe merit naming this room where these events took place, where these initiatives were passed and the debates took place in recognition of the person who advanced them or primarily advanced them, because I think Councilwoman Reynolds would not ever say that she did this alone. She was collaborative. She worked with anybody and everybody who could get the ball across the goal line. Right. So one of the one of the nation's first gay rights laws passed in Denver in 1990 with significant debate and controversy, such controversy that led in part because other cities around the state also passed similar laws around the same time. But it resulted in an event many of us remember it came out of Colorado Springs was Amendment two in 1992, and that was a constitutional amendment that passed by the people of this state that said no city can adopt any gay essentially any gay rights laws. This was challenged up to the state Supreme Court and eventually went to the United States Supreme Court in 1996 and resulted in the landmark ruling that extended equal protection based on sexual orientation. You will hear tonight. You will hear tonight from two individuals who were central to that debate. They. One of them flew in from Portland, Oregon, to be here tonight to talk to you about those times and some of the hate and division that. Roll out of that debate. Councilwoman Reynolds also was a leader in changing the city's most restrictive zone district regulation r zero zoning under the old 1956 code. R zero zoning was the most exclusive in the city. And one of the regulations was that. No unrelated adults could live together. Unmarried couples could not live together. Effectively, this was a barrier, a bar prohibition. Two gay couples living in some of our finest neighborhoods. You know, it only applied in the zero zone, but we're saying, well, you all can live somewhere else, but you can't live here. And she was instrumental in leading the charge to have that repealed. She also led a successful drive for the budget amendment that we know today as the the mill levy for people with intellectual developmental disabilities. That was hotly contested both here on the floor and on the third floor. This was during the Pena administration, I believe, excuse me. And there was actually kind of a raucous debate. I won't name the names. And I think who told me about this? I think it was former councilman Ed Thomas told me about this. And Councilman Ortega, I think you were council president that year that this was being debated. Councilwoman Reynolds got into a heated argument on this floor with a male member of the body who shall remain nameless. And it got so intense that I was told the Council on President Ortega said from that desk, Madam President, would you to take it out in the hall? Whereupon Councilman Thomas shouted from his desk. My money's on Reynolds. And. And he won because that mill levee did pass. And it has been extended by the voters of Denver once Tabor came into effect. The voters of Denver approved increasing that mill levy sometime in the early to late nineties. I don't have the exact year. Let me just add, when when that passed, it was only generating like around $1,000,000. That fund now generates upwards of it's a full mill. I don't remember what that is now, but when I came on in 2011, it was at about 13 million, and now we think it's closer to 20 million. So it's making huge impact on people with developmental disabilities. And Cathy should be so proud of that work that she did. And finally, the other initiative that we want to bring to your attention is one that I recall vividly when I was when I was a reporter, the Rocky Mountain News. I remember the intense level of threats that threats that came in to this office over here against the councilwoman because she was the prime sponsor of the first assault weapons ban in Denver, the one that eventually survived court challenges and challenges from the state legislature to preempt our home rule ability to take such action in the here in the city. I remember many times after Monday night that she had to have a police escort to her home in Park Hill because of the threats that were coming in. And we have had the pleasure of the sheriff's department being at our Monday night meetings on a regular basis. And I can remember having to be escorted out to our cars after that legislation passed, because the threat wasn't just directed at Kathy, it was at the whole body because we passed it. Some things don't change, do they? Project initiatives. I intentionally led this presentation, Madam President, with policy initiatives. But I also want to talk about project initiatives because Councilwoman Reynolds, along with many of the folks you see here behind us. Played central roles in the development of so many things that the people of Denver right now take for granted the Colorado Convention Center, the new Colorado Convention Center. Where should it go? Remember, comes from there were three different sites that were Central Platte Valley, the Golden Triangle, or right downtown. Imagine what this city would look like if instead of a transit hub behind Union Station, there was a convention center. I think that was the Marvin Davis site. And then the site behind where the library is now. There wouldn't have been a library expansion if we had made that mistake. The Convention Center Hotel, which is now the Hyatt Regency Denver International Airport, of course, Coors Field, the new Broncos stadium, the Pepsi Center, which is now changed its name, I think, to Ball Arena. I used this picture. Thank you to Leah and Carla SHAPIRO from The Denver Post, the editor who allowed us to use these photos. This is. This is a photograph that really says something about Kathy Reynolds being working with a group of men right over there in that corner that if you recognize that's that window over there, she is the person with her. Back to you and her purse on the floor. I'm going to steal one of Rick's stories. Rick told me that one day a constituent got in Cathy's face and said, You know what your problem is, Reynolds? You never saw a project that you didn't like. And if there's anything you can say about Kathy Reynolds, one of the first things will be she was very quick witted. She would think of the rest of the responses. Take me three days to come up with. Right? She got right back in the guy's face and said, no, you never saw a project that I didn't like. She was also a leader in representing Denver outside of this room. She served all 28 years on this body as the rep, as one of the representatives to the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District Board. What we now call the Mile High Flood District, including the last 23 years as the board chair. And you will hear during the public hearing from the former head of the of what they called advocate, I remember a councilwoman around was giving reports the committee saying she had gone to an urban drainage luncheon that month and giving a report on. I thought nothing is less appetizing than an urban drainage luncheon. I have no idea what they served there, but doesn't sound appetizing. She was twice elected as president of the Colorado Municipal League, and in your email you have a statement of support from the former president of the Colorado Municipal League, Sam Mamet, who is on travel and could not be here tonight and deeply regrets that he could not be here. But he sent a statement that is in your email. She was elected president of the National League of Cities in 1987, serving as basically the chief spokesperson for municipal issues in the country, testifying in Congress several times during that year as president. And after leaving council, she was a charter member of the Citizen Oversight Board and served on the Colorado Convention Center Hotel Board. I want to just. Yes. So when she was the president of the National League of Cities, she encouraged all of us to get involved with the National League of Cities. We attended many of their annual conferences. It gave us an opportunity to learn about best practices being done in other cities, to come back with new and different ideas. And I just appreciated that about her because it just continued to help with the growth and the knowledge and the ability to just look at things differently. Thank you. I love this picture. It shows a bit of determination and kind of the pursed lips. Right. And she must be really mad at something. I don't know what it was. Maybe it's one of my stories in The Rocky. I don't know, but. When we were looking a couple of years ago for where could we find a place to recognize Cathy's contributions? We looked around, but she served at large, and so she didn't have a district where there was a park that she championed or a rec center like the Kala Madison Rec Center or the Shimer Rec Center or the Hiawatha Davis Recreation Center. She was citywide and we were kind of brainstorming. There's no park, there's no rec center. And it was one of our former legislative analysts. You might remember Shelley Smith. Who just popped up and said, Why not the chamber? Because of the variety, the breadth, the depth of her accomplishments. What better place than the room in which they occurred? The room where it happened, if you will. And so that's why we bring this this bill forward. Let me before you start the public hearing, Madam President, one former member who cannot be here or is not here is watching online. That is Councilwoman Rosemary Rodriguez from Council District three and who served in several other roles in city government. She sent me a message that she I don't know if she wanted me to read it. Maybe she'll kill me when she when I see her next. But here's what she said. Here's my synopsis of Kathy Reynolds. There is a song from the show Gypsy, that is sung by Mama Rose. The relevant lyric is this. You either got it or you don't. And guys, I got it. That describes Cathy's relationship with Denver. She knew the code. She knew the players. She knew the people. What a wonderful idea to name the meeting room for the woman who convened countless meetings for Denver's diverse, disparate and disagreeable. She knew our people and loved us all. Full stop. I also want to mention I don't I didn't see I don't know if we have online. Former Councilwoman Elena Wedgeworth. She online is she signed up to speak as well? Excellent. Okay. Thank you. And so, Madam President, with one more moment of indulgence, I want to mention one other person who is here who flew in from Washington , DC. Where? Oh, Judy. Judy Gold was Kathy Reynolds council aide and started at a time when it was very unusual for us to have assistants working with us. Right. So, Judy, I want to thank you for coming in, flying in from D.C. to be here for this special moment. And with that, Madam President, I'm told Mayor Webb is also on line. To speak since Mayor Webb is on line. I wanted to show everybody that among her effects, 1996, 1997, the mayor's box at Mile High Stadium. The tickets were always divvied up between the mayor's office and the city council. And there was quite a blowup. Maybe Mayor Webb. He might not address this. So let me do it. These are the last four. Season ticket packages from the 1997 season for the mayor's box and nine in 1997 that never got distributed. And there are still ink in Cathy's files. And so it's a little bit of history. I don't know if it's too late to get them to the mayor now, but I'll give them back to Rick. With that, Madam President, I don't know if, Councilwoman, you have any more remarks before we open the hearing. The only thing I would add is that when. Judy Gold was a council aide to Councilwoman Reynolds. Ramona martinez was one of the other aides. I think they were the first two that were hired on to work for members of city council. And then Ramona went on to replace Sam Sanders as a member of council. But they paved the way for council as well. And back then, there was only one aide for council member. It grew. It has grown over time. So thank you all for allowing us to do this presentation. We're truly honored to bring this forward and look forward to hearing from her former colleagues as well. Very good. Well, thank you. Councilmembers Ortega and Flynn for the presentation. We always appreciate learning a bit more about the history and the remarkable accomplishments of Kathy Reynolds. This evening, we have 14 individuals signed up to speak and we're going to call the first two who are joining us online. And then the rest of the speakers are here in chambers with us. And so our first speaker this evening is Wellington Webb. And we need to see if you are on line. We have one call in number and we believe that that is. Former Mayor Webb. But we're not. Seen it now. Okay. All right. We're going to go ahead and we will try to get him back into the queue. But we're going to go ahead and go with Elba. Wedgeworth is our next speaker. Okay. We can. We want you to go ahead and we can hear you now. Go ahead, please. We're not able to hear you. You might have to unmute. I think we're having some problems with the mike. And so we might need to have you leave the Zoom meeting and log back in. And when you log back in, make sure to connect your audio up. We're showing that your audio's not connected. And so we'll go ahead and try to get those two online speakers back into the queue. And so in the interest of time, we'll go ahead and transition into chambers. And the first speaker in chambers is Tim Santos. Good evening, Madam President. Members of Council. My name is Tim Sandoz and I currently reside in Green Valley Ranch and am proud to be able to be here tonight to speak to you about my dear friend and mentor Cathy Reynolds. Now, Cathy Reynolds and my father, Sam Santos, were elected at the same time, in the same term, and they came in to serve together. At that time, my student council advisor was Mr. Rick Reynolds, who just happened to be Cathy's husband. He is the one who taught me Robert's Rules of Order. He taught me Robert's Rules of Order. Kathy taught me how to use those rules, and she taught me very, very well. Kathy was one of the smartest people you ever come across, and she was always very witty, also knew how to count votes. So in addition to taking me under her wing, as she did because my father had passed away and as dad, I have to mention so many other women that were on the council. Debbie Ortega, Ramona martinez. Happy Haines. They all really embraced me because I was Sam son. Sam had passed away and so they were helping me to understand the rules, how we worked, what we did. Well, these same women helped me with the very first major piece of legislation I was passing, and I was sitting right where Councilwoman Sandoval is sitting at the time . And I was waxing eloquent about how well we had done all the work that had happened. And then slowly a message from Councilwoman Reynolds, who happened to be present at that time, skipped across table to table to table till it got to me. And I opened it up and it said, You have seven votes. Keep on talking. You'll only have six. That was Kathy Runnels. She was sharp. She was quick. She was very and she also was very straight forward about the things that I needed to do and helped really for me to grow as a member of council. Now, as I look at the time. Oh, it's not from Kathy Reynolds, she said. You're talking too much. Thank you all very much. All right. Thank you very much. Oh, we're going to go ahead and move back online because I believe we've got Elvira Wedgeworth. We've got her back in the queue. Yes. Can you hear me now? Hello? Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Thank you. And good evening, Madam President, and members of the Denver City Council. My name is Alper Wedgeworth and I live in the Whittier neighborhood in Denver and District nine. I also wish to thank and acknowledge Councilwoman Glenn and Councilwoman Ortega for their efforts to name the Denver City Council Chambers in honor of Cathy Reynolds. I work with and personally knew Cathy Reynolds since 1989 when I began my public service career serving as a senior analyst on the Denver City Council staff. I worked directly with Kathy on some of her legislative policy issues regarding the ban of assault weapons in the city of Denver and many others. I was always impressed, very impressed with Kathy's thoughtfulness, her tenacity and her sense of humor. She was also always very kind and encouraging and a great steward of this institution. Kathy always encouraged me to learn and have a self-education on public policy in a way that would be balanced and also, to be fair, to approach all issues . Kathy was a very strong woman who was able to break down the stereotypes of leadership during that time. As was said tonight, very few women have this leadership role in government and to break those glass ceilings so other women would be able to follow. She was very determined. And at times quiet and always thoughtful and always grounded in her leadership and her ability to make a difference and to communicate and have to say again. She had a tremendous sense of humor. Kathy would always make you laugh about a lot of different things all the time. I truly appreciate also her courage and her confidence and her leadership and her passion. Our public service as she spoke, to be open for change and to be positive and proactive, suggesting things to you that you should consider. I will always be thankful to Kathy for her encouragement and her friendship and the many things I learned from her over the years. When I became the Denver City Council president myself. Kathy was many great things and woman of many accomplishments. Ever. I believe that she was proudest of being a wife, a mother, grandmother, and a friend mentor to everyone. Now and in the future. I will always think fondly of Kathy and the role she played in my journey of public service and her leadership on behalf of the city of Denver. I will always, always be thankful to her. To Rick and the family. We were blessed to have her in our lives, and we thank you for sharing her with us. So thank you, Cathy, and thank you, members of Council for your consideration. Thank you. Our next speaker is in chambers, Stephanie Foote. Good evening. Members of Council, um, councilman flynn and Councilwoman Ortega. You guys did just an incredible job that brings tears to my eyes to see these pictures of Cathy. Because I remember I was on council. I was elected in 1983 and I served three terms. I was a really a newbie to government, but I knew that in 1983 I had a nine month old baby and Mike, my campaign, when I talked to people, I said, if we don't do something right now, Denver's not going to be here when my kids grow up and there's not a place where they can work. I came to council. I had no idea how this process worked. I was I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but I was terrified. And I had to learn the rules. I had to watch what everybody else was doing. Cathy mentored me through all that, and then at the end of the first year, she took me in her office and as only Cathy could, she said, Steph, you've been here a year now. You can talk from that time on, whenever I needed any kind of guidance, I needed help. I needed to understand from the absolutely best public policy mind that I have ever known or been close to. She helped us all. All of us. I think that had the the beauty of spending time with her to gain that knowledge that we did not come here with. We dealt with huge issues. We you saw her list. We came in at the time. I came in with the new mayor, Mayor Federico Pena. And it was really a struggle to form coalitions, to understand what everybody's point of view was. But you all know that, and Cathy in particular, that we had to have all the arrows pointing in the same direction if we were going to do the right thing for Denver . So thank you all so much for this. This is just an incredible tribute. It couldn't go to someone more deserving. And Cathy, we love you and we miss you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Happy Hands. Good evening, Madam President and members of Council. My name is Happy Haines. I live in North Park Hill. Actually, I live mostly across the street these days as you live here. Thank you, Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Ortega, for this brilliant idea. I can't think of a more fitting tribute to Cathy Reynolds. A real state's person and policy leader unparalleled. And hopefully it'll inspire a lot more wonderful decisions for many, many decades to come. Um, uh, I. I knew Cathy Reynolds the year she was elected was your first. The councilman that I served under as a council aide, served in the first, was elected that same year when that district was first created in northeast Denver around some concerns about equity in this city. And so I got to know Cathy Reynolds from on the perspective of a city council aide. So when I was elected, as many people here have said, Cathy was a mentor and she was more than that. She was a friend. But when I was first elected, I got called into the room to Stephanie and she told me that I would be consider myself proud to follow my predecessor in every respect but one, and that was to keep my speeches much briefer. And I tried to follow that advice most often. Um, but I think as was mentioned also, she was a teacher. I know Rick really was the teacher in the family, but Cathy was too. And she considered a government governance and public policy a lifelong learning experience. And so you've heard from the presentation all of the organizations that she belonged to, both locally and in this state and across this country. And she used those opportunities and encouraged all of us, likewise, to use those as learning experiences, because we didn't know at all here. She didn't know it all, none of us did. And so we could take advantage of what was happening across the state, across this country and constantly learn. And that's what she was in every organization. She was such an extraordinary leader. And Cathy was a kind of leader. She was a go to person in a get it done kind of person. So she believed in getting things done, not at the expense of principle, but she believed that there were always there was always a way, not only one way, but a way. And so she used her power of creating relationships and listening to people and connecting with people both inside this chamber and outside throughout the city to bring people together to hash it out. I never saw her run away from a fight, ever. But we're at our time. And so. I. Want to let you know. So thank you very much for allowing us. Thank you. Thank you. Next, the good guys, Scott, Scott Tucker. Scott Tucker. There you go. Thank you, Councilmember. My name is. Scott Tucker, and I was the. Executive director of the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District. And Kathy was my boss for 23 years. She was chairman of the board of the District. Kathy had a wonderful sense of humor. And I think you see something is kind of common as we go through this. But as she always referred to the UDV seed as a deferred, you'd f you D and I was always worried when she made presentations before like the in the Senate or the House and legislative issues. And I was always grateful when she did not use that term. You might remember the seventies and eighties were really. Very. Tumultuous times between the suburbs and in the city. Some of you might see some of the seasons, cities, season citizens might remember the POUNDSTONE amendment that restricted Denver's ability to annex. There were just a lot of difficulties there. The board of directors was made up of the mayor of Denver, three Denver council people, four mayors appointed by the governor from suburban communities and. Five county commissioners, and then two. Engineers appointed by the board. And she was able to handle them very, very nicely. And out of that mixture were 25 years of of getting things done. And that's, I thought was just really, really fantastic. She was very smart and intellectually, both intellectually and politically, and she had a wonderful way with people and of expressing yourself. And quite simply, people trusted Kathy and believed her. The highlight of the month for me when I was I meet with Kathy for lunch right before the board meeting two or three days before the board meeting, and that went on for 23 years. They added it up that it was not like 240 or 230 lunch meetings. We discuss the issues of drainage and. Flood control and all those arcane subjects. And finally, I'd like to thank Kathy and Rick. They introduced my family to Gilbert and Sullivan. And Rick, thank you very much for that refrigerator that and thank you very much for allowed to speak. Thank you. Our next speaker is Tony Ogden. Good evening, Madam President. Good evening, members of the Council. My name is Tony Ogden and I, my husband and I currently reside in Portland, Oregon. I was a Denver resident from the early eighties to 2002, and I had the pleasure of working with candidate Kathy Reynolds on some key initiatives at that time. It is a privilege to be here to speak in support of this bill tonight, and my thanks to her for bringing it forward. You're going to hear lots of stories about Cathy. You've heard a lot of stories about Cathy. Her storied career precedes us. I will speak to one issue in particular. I lasted and testified before this council in 1990, when only one of you was a member of this council. Many of you also were here in support of Denver's Comprehensive Anti-Discrimination Bill Ordinance Number 623. I worked alongside several advocates in developing the original draft of that bill and helped found the Equal Protection Ordinance Coalition with the draft bill in hand. T shook and I knocked on Cathy Reynolds door in about 1988. Cathy opened the door wide for us and offered her support and sponsorship. There seems to be a no brainer today, but in the eighties and the nineties, rights for the LGBTQ community were still being hard to find. Few jurisdictions in the country had a gay rights bill. Only two other cities, Aspen and Boulder, in the state of Colorado, had an ordinance ordinance that included sexual orientation. When we first approached Cathy, she was working to an amendment amend Denver's ah zero zoning. And so we worked with Cathy and others to change the zero zoning because it would serve as the basically the foundation for us to be able to do the work on the Civil Rights Ordinance. Cathy was keen on political strategy, understood the importance of coalition building and of patients. Cathy did not shy away from and what was at times a very ugly and hateful opposition during that time. She was steadfast in her support through an attempted repeal of only the sexual orientation portion of the ordinance. The fight over amendment to and she celebrated with us vindication when the Supreme Court did decide Romer versus Evans. Kathy opened her door when many others would not. On this and so many other issues Kathy supported. She demonstrated leadership and is in the face of significant obstacles, not out of political gain, but out of true conviction, because it was the right thing to do for the people of the city and county of Denver. As others have and will continue to say about Kathy. She loved this city. She was dedicated to it and committed to making it a better place. I would go so far to say, as Cathy's leadership and courage in fighting discrimination is one reason Colorado has an openly gay governor today. I am proud to have worked with Kathy and to have regarded her a friend. Renaming Council Chambers in her honor speaks to what it means to be a public servant. Leadership. Dedication. Commitment. Honor. Integrity. Her name on this chamber will serve as a constant reminder of those values. I appreciate the opportunity to be here before you tonight and to urge your support of this bill. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Rick Reynolds. Oh, boy. Where? My glasses. Really? Sorry. First of all, I'd like to introduce my son, Matt. My son Bob. Kathy's boys. Thank you all for being here. My name is Rick Reynolds. I live in I am a Denver native and I live at 16th and Locust in Denver. How can anyone talk about three decades of service in only 3 minutes? I won't even try. But what was Denver like? Before Kathy Reynolds served? There were no women in city council. There were parts of Denver where unmarried couples could not live together and same sex marriage was illegal. Those couples did not enjoy the same rights as heterosexual people did. There was no convention center or convention center hotel. There was no city lobbyist at the state capital. The council members did not have a staff. Kathy how did the first one? Judy Gold. Neighborhood organizations were not and were not notified of zoning changes and liquor permits. One could legally own an assault weapon in Denver. There was no dedicated, dedicated funding for the developmentally disabled. There was no citizens oversight board or independent monitor. There was no cable TV in Denver. There were no Colorado Rockies or Colorado Avalanche. Coors Field did not exist. The 16th mall, the 16th Street Mall did not exist. The early Caulkins Opera House was in. It was a small arena for conventions and basketball games. The Better Concert Hall did not exist. Colorado Open Journey did not exist. The Bonfils Theater complex did not exist. DEA did not exist. Lowry was an Air Force base. Kathy had a huge hand in all of these changes. With these changes have happened without her. Maybe so over time. But she pushed them. In her own words. Kathy, if you ever wish to be a celebrity. What would you like to be famous for? I've had about all the celebrity I can handle from one time or another. What I'd like to be known for would be kindness, generosity. And good humor. I'll never know. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Ramona martinez. Well, good evening, members of city council. Madam President, it's this very difficult for a lot of us tonight to get up here and express how we feel about Cathy Reynolds. I met Cathy before she got elected to city council. We went to Washington, D.C. in 1974, a long time ago, and a women's conference that was for women in leadership to learn how to become leaders and leadership roles. Well, the city. Colorado's. Delegation is where I met Cathy because. We had lunch and dinner. Together during the week. We were out there in D.C.. And Cathy got elected right after that conference at Washington. A couple I don't know if it was a year or two later, but she got elected. I grew up in this city. I grew up in downtown Denver. I'm back in my city. In downtown Denver. I lived here all my life. There were never any male, any women on the city council when I was growing up. There were never. Except for album Colwell. I think he was the first minority to ever sit on this city council when I was growing up. And Kathy, she broke the glass ceiling for a lot of you up there. She broke it for me. Look at this. This council is now. Made up of the diversity that this city is all about. Not only did she help build and help us negotiate the Mile High Stadium, I sat with her as a member of the negotiating. Team for the New Mile High Stadium. She made. Sure. That minority participation was involved in our contracts. Denver International Airport. When we negotiated to get percentages, which of course the Supreme Court threw out, said it was unconstitutional. She supported our efforts. Hiawatha Davis, Happy Haines and I worked Debbie worked on that formative action program, goals for the airport. Cathy was right there supporting us, giving. Us the encouragement and negotiating those. Those type of agreements with all the developers in this city. She never back down from anybody. She taught me how to sit down and negotiate against and 17th. Street attorneys. And so did the news. We sat together on the mall and on the stadium, Mile High Stadium. I never did that before. I was just a kid from the west side that grew up in the city, never went to West High School, never thought I would be sitting on city council, never becoming the president like I became a president of the city council. But Cathy Reynolds broke that glass ceiling. Not for me, not just for me, but for all of you up there as well. So nothing is more appropriate than having this named after her. So thank you all for doing that. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Judy Gold. Thank you, Madam President. Members of the City Council. My name is Judy Gold, and I live in Washington, D.C.. I am honored to be here this evening to speak in strong support of Council Bill 21 1322, to name this City Council Chambers for Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds. It was important for me to come all this way to speak. I worked for Cathy Reynolds for 18 years, from 1975 to 1993. I was the first council person, personal staff assistant ever hired in 3 minutes or 30 minutes. I cannot cover all that Cathy accomplished, but I will try to highlight some of her more creative legislative moments. Denver is a greater city today because of Cathy Reynolds. Her innovative work resulted in a way to issue municipal bonds that eliminate conflicts of interest. Psychological testing and training is now required for all police officers to ensure they are qualified to protect and serve, and women can become cops and firefighters. Cathy wrote a law increasing transparency between neighborhood groups in the city via direct lines of communications. In 1990, she authored and passed the gay rights bill that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Because of her, you have a ban on assault weapons that was also upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. She wrote The Denver law that allows women to seek lawful abortions without fear of harassment. But it was her day to day work that made Cathy most proud. Whether on economic development, housing, health and hospitals, the developmentally disabled or the city budget or even trash, potholes or zoning. Cathy put her heart and mind into all issues. She would cut a deal, but she would never sacrifice her principles. My favorite quote is from her first reelection way back in 1979, when I asked someone if you would vote for her, and he said yes, because he didn't always agree with her, but she would always give him the straight story and never change her position from one person to the next. That was and still is the best compliment ever, because her constituents always knew where she stood, whether or not they agreed with her. Councilwoman Kathy Carter. Reynolds was a unique person and an exceptional elected official. Her constant dedication, coupled with her wry sense of humor, gave her this rare characteristic that provided Denver with quality legislation, funding national recognition and a plan for the future. For all of these reasons and many more. It is extremely fitting that this council chambers be named for her in the future. When people ask, Who is Kathy Reynolds? Someone can explain. She was the best this wonderful city has to offer. I ask for your support. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Donna. Good. Donna. Good. Hi. I appreciate being asked to speak tonight. I'm done a good. And until ten days ago, I lived in Park Hill for the last 21 years. I moved into Councilman Black's district ten days ago, and I don't even know where I am. I got nosebleeds when I used to go above Alameda. So I think the reason I'm here tonight is to talk about something that you do hear about sometimes. But maybe we need to remember Cathy as somebody who accomplished everything we've heard about tonight. And maybe we need to remember for something that we've only heard touched on a couple of times. So I'm with commonly known as Political Hack. I've run 17 elections. I worked for two presidents, two mayors, two governors, and a bunch of other people in political office. And what I have learned in all those years is that you can spend time with people, you can work for them. And. They don't really care whether they're working for the people of a city. The people of a country, the people of a state. Or a major corporation. They don't. But what people who are really the ones who make the difference and I can recognize them right off because I've worked with so many of both kinds. But it's what Kathy stood for. I think L.B. mentioned it. Maybe Rosemary touched on it. Tony Ogden. Certainly. Sorry. Kathy had a passion for service. Kathy was the real deal. She cared about every one of us in Denver. And when people say she loved the city, I love Denver. And it means I love my neighborhood, I love my corner cafe. It means I love where I walk my dog. And no matter whether I was working in Pakistan or D.C., I kept the home in Denver, and Denver was home. Kathy loved not just the city, because what does that mean? What it means, I think, is that she loved us. She loved the people of Denver. She wanted us to have better health services. The ability to live in love as we stood. She wanted people who had never been given a chance to be given a chance. She wanted us to be able to take our family to different venues. She loved us. And maybe it's too late to say to her face, but we can say to her family and we can remind people forever by putting in this room that a woman worked here once who spent 28, almost 30 years her life every day dedicated to making this city a better place for each and every person who lived here. She was an early comer with things like LGBT rights. She fought for Denver Hill. She was the real deal. And I appreciate what you're all going to do tonight. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Tisha. He shook. Oh, goodness. Hi. I'm Tisha. I live in Council District 11. Hi. So I met Cathy with my small circle of friends. We're trying to get Denver to pass an equal protection ordinance in 1988. We were young and we were dedicated and we were as ignorant as all get out. Fortunately, there were wiser heads who decided to help us, and Kathy was one of those, as were most of the folks speaking tonight. Her support was crucial in the 1990 Council vote. In Oliver and I will just be forever grateful to. Her for all that. She did. To get that past and to stay with us every time it was fought over and over. Like many. She taught me how to count to seven. What was more important to me was that lesson, and it was a continuing lesson in how to work well with others. Especially those you disagree with. How wonderful. To name Council Chambers. For her. I really hope. That her name and her legacy serve to inspire future council members. Thank you, Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Ortega for doing this. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Joyce Foster. And then we're going to follow with Martin Foley. I've. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the Denver City Council. It is truly a pleasure being in front of you this evening. This was my happiest job. I ran for election when Stephanie Foote was appointed by Mayor Webb to become his chief of staff. And I was recruited. To run. And the only time I ever had been down here was during the amendment that Kathy was running for. Well, if it wasn't for you. My husband was very involved with her. He was the co-chair of No. One to campaign. So I was elected as the first Jewish woman to sit on the Denver City Council and bring that community with me. And I had no idea how many people sat on the city council when I entered the race. I was very naive. I had been working for Jewish family service for 17 years and my whole life I had been recruited. I had been resettling immigrants from the former Soviet Union, from Laos boat people and helping them find jobs and homes. That's what I did for a living. And after I was elected, my first job on city council was to break a tie on who was to be elected city council president. It was between Cathy Reynolds, who I knew a little bit from the the work that she did with my husband and another gentleman who will go nameless . I really thought, well, she's been here so long. She's been president of city council. I'll add somebody else. I'll vote for somebody else. So I voted for the other guy. Whoa. Was that a bad move on my part? Yeah. I was soon to lose my best friend, and I apologized about a year later after I saw and was learning. You know what she did and how well she did it? And I did apologize. And I said, whenever you run for city council president again, I promise I'm going to support you because you are really smart . You're thoughtful. You're respectful. And she's really, really smart. Really smart. And I loved Kathy. She became such a good friend. And Steven and I miss her. We miss Rick. We miss our community. I was on the council for ten years until I was term limited and. Sometimes we would get together and just visit and it was wonderful. And I miss Kathy and I can't imagine a better name for this cherished hall, this treasure that we have in Colorado. So I definitely support this bill. Thank you. Or whatever it is. It's. Thank you. Our next speaker is Martin Place. Members of council. Hi, my name is modestly. I'm a Capitol Hill resident for about 50 years. But probably the longer stake is that I was a city employee for 37 years. Most of that was as a career employee. I was an appointee for under Mayor Webb, and then I was a contract employee. So I sort of every flavor of employee you can have. And I go back to when Kevin Flynn was one of those annoying reporters in City Hall and Debbie was a legislative aide, if I remember correctly, when we first met. So those are the familiar faces on council. Kevin, I should have asked you, was this a promotion or a demotion going from reporter this. So I started five years before Cathy Reynolds became a member of council, had occasion to work with her on a whole host of other of issues because I was the face of the finance office for a much of that time. The main thing I want to affirm is how the extraordinary leadership and sense of service that Cathy demonstrated, manifested and that we others were able to learn from. I knew it. The mayors knew it. The council members knew it. And the people knew it. If you wanted to find out what the straight story is, you talk to Cathy Reynolds. She was also a friend. And I'm very grateful that you're recognizing her in this way. Thank you. Thank you. We wanted to see if we might have Wellington Webb in the Zoom platform. All right. Okay. Well, we tried. We will go ahead and move forward then. That concludes our speakers this evening. Thank you, everyone, for sharing your memories and perspective of her and questions from members of Council on Council. Bill. One, three, two, two. All right. Seen no questions by members of council. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill one, three, two, two. And I hope that we might start out with council members Flynn and Ortega, and we can follow with other members of council after they go. Certainly. Thank you, Madam President. I don't want to lengthen the mindful of what Tim Sanders had said. I want to have a note pass down from Council President Gilmore, but I just want to thank everybody for showing up and reminding folks of what public service is all about, what change is all about, and what meeting the challenge of change is all about, and what it takes to do that. And a number of the people in this room who worked with Cathy in accomplishing that. Really tell that story. It was a group effort. It took a leader, but it took the whole village. Really? Ramona Councilwoman Martinez, your words really, really struck me. And still to this day, your story of how you grew up here and then became yourself president of the council and with the help of Councilwoman Reynolds mentorship. When you worked for Sam and then later when you joined her as a as an equal colleague. Every time I come to this building, I drive by the house that you told me you grew up in, that tiny little bungalow. I can imagine that the little girl who grew up in that rose to the accomplishments that you did and having broken, having benefited from the glass ceiling that that Kathy Reynolds broke. And I and I would have similar remarks for everyone else in the room for for former Councilwoman Haynes, for Councilwoman Foster. Councilwoman Foote. Am I missing anybody? Councilwoman Marcia Johnson was your. Councilman Santos this I can't imagine a better way to memorialize the record of accomplishment that she had than in naming this room. As I said at the end of the presentation, this room where it happened, it's the appropriate place to do it. We have memorialized other people by naming elements of buildings. John Parr, Sandy Weidner, we've recognized with the PA Weidner room, and I think this is a crowning honor for a career that really changed Denver. And with that, Madam President, I would certainly ask for everyone's support for this bill. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. So I had the pleasure of being a council aide along with Judy Gold, along with Ramona martinez, Happy Haines. During the time that she had first got elected in her first term, and we all went on to accept, Judy, to replace the council members that we served with , she was an inspiration to all of us to want to to be like her, to want to make a difference in our community, and to step into those big shoes that were filled by our predecessors. And, you know, to see that we still have this many women serving on the council. She truly did break that glass ceiling for for all of us. And she was she was a dear friend. We all loved her. I mean, just the fact that this many of her former colleagues are here tonight to express those words of appreciation and love that we all had for her. I just thank you all for being here tonight. And I really would appreciate a unanimous support of this bill tonight so that we could officially change the name of this chamber after one of our great leaders, Kathy Reynolds. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Kinney. Thank you. Council President. I am part of the next generation right of council members. So unlike some of the folks who are here tonight, I didn't serve as a council aide and I was a young mom a and looking to run for office as the first out member of the council. We don't know. There may have been other LGBTQ members, but the first one to kind of run as an out individual and Maria Garcia Berry made the introduction and said, you need to meet Cathy. And not just because you're running for the At-Large seat, because you and Cathy, Cathy, Cathy, you know, had a brand of leadership that she she thought I needed to understand and know about. And it was pretty intimidating, actually, to learn about her history in the office and, you know, to be someone who didn't come from inside the city family, because that was clearly something that was really important to a lot of Cathy and her predecessors. And so but I also was really inspired. It struck me the first time I met her, like I might not even have the opportunity to run for an office like this with the background I have, if it weren't for Cathy. And so I was so nervous too to try to live up to this idea that and people would ask me, they'd say, you know, what do you want to do as the first out lesbian in city council? Like what big policies are you going to run for the community? And I would say. The important thing to understand is that straight allies paved the way. That it took those from communities who had not lived in the shoes of being a gay person to pass laws that were inclusive. And that was really important to me, thinking about being a leader, right? When I worked on immigrant issues, I have not walked the shoes of an immigrant in our city or in our country. But having to think about I can't wait for for for only people with that background to lead or, you know, police accountability where, you know, we have a huge community of individuals of color and men of color in particular, to whom police accountability is really important. I can't only represent that issue if I've walked in their shoes. Cathy inspired me and sent the message that you have to lead for all of those communities with their experience and partnership, right? Hearing TE and others talk about how she worked with you and that model of trying to see, I might not have walked in those shoes, but if I can be alongside you, right? Those are the things that I took. And in my early terms on the council, I would get the short emails. You know, some of you might have served before the email era, but I would get the short email from Cathy and I would pretty much know in that one sentence if she liked or did not like a quote in the paper or a vote that I had taken. And I learned to pick up the phone and call her, especially when she didn't like it and she was so curious. She would always actually want to hear why I had voted differently than she thought. And she never cut me off, right? She never was like, You're dead to me because you voted against. She would say, okay, well, I hate it, but you know, and then we'd move on and I'd get the next email and I had done okay. She was still serving on the Citizens Oversight Board in my first term, and that was a topic that we talked about right when there were some hard moments. Our our former monitor had a little more contentious relationship with our safety agencies than our most recent monitor did. And she, as someone who loved the city, loved the mayor and loved the safety agencies, was also really willing to hold them accountable. She did not think those two things were mutually exclusive. And I continue to feel that same way that I can love the city while also wanting us to do better and holding us accountable to those high standards. So those are the things I've taken personally. And as her health began to struggle, we tried to remember her in these chambers in terms of celebrating the anniversaries of the nondiscrimination ordinance as part of the history. And I remember going to visit her at the house. And I will just say for me personally, I often heard from Rick and Cathy together. I kind of feel like I got to know you together. And it's for me very fitting that so much of her service you are so involved in. And so I want to say thank you to you as well, because that inspiration, the trust, the watchful eye, all of that, I feel like was really something you did as a team, and it meant a lot to me, even though I did not work with her in the same way you all did. I felt that mentorship and I felt that support and I felt those high standards and they made me a better councilwoman. So thank you to all of you for the service that you performed for our city and thank you to her family. We know a little bit about the shared sacrifice that a family has for service. And so I thank you for the last dinners, the interrupted birthdays and all the other things that helped make her service to our city so possible. So I'm really excited and thank you to my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think you found the perfect place. So thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Kenney, Councilman Cashman. Know. Thank you, Madam President. I thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Flynn, for bringing this this forward. This this pretty humbling for me. I've been I grew up in the Garden State of New Jersey. And on Halloween night, just a couple of weeks ago, I celebrated my 50, 50 years in Colorado, all of that, except for maybe one year in the city and county of Denver. And for a long time as a journalist, I had a community newspaper in South Denver. I spoke to a number of the folks in the room here, including Councilwoman Reynolds. But what I'm remembering when I when I was thinking about running and was even 13 or 14, I called my friend Lynn Preston Hall, who was an aide for Councilwoman Johnson. And I said, you know, how much time does this job take? And she said, Well, you know, she said, Paul, it would be up to you. You know, some people talk about working and then others of them actually work. And she said, My boss works so. I took that to heart and I've tried to work. I don't know that I would ever even aspire to the heights that Ms.. Reynolds achieved, but I do try to try to work. You know, I did speak with Councilwoman Reynolds a few times as a journalist, and I found her to be as described by some of the speakers. She was always would return my call, but she did not seem to be a particular fan of talking to the press, and she was always very direct. She would explain fully, answer my questions fully, but she was not a look at me person. She was. My sense was she was a let's let's get it done type of person. And as I said, you know, she was very direct and to the point. But I did she had the opportunity to see another side of her. The sense of humor that people talk about. I happened to be as actually to I believe that were Fridays to Fridays in a row. I happened to be playing golf over on a golf course and came off the first green. And there was this woman laughing her tail off on the second tee about 20 yards away and got a little bit closer. And it was Councilwoman Reynolds and I don't know what the topic was, but she was laughing about 200 yards down the fairway and having a great time. So I was pleased to hear that side of her. And the other thing I wanted to comment about when I first got elected to office, Albert Brooks was president at the time of council, and he appointed me. To the Urban Drainage and Flood Control Board, and who knew what that could possibly be? And why would I have been subjected to this? And what I came to find out, first of all, is it is one of the most well-run, marvelous organizations I've ever had the privilege to be associated with. I want to acknowledge Dave Bennetts, who's I think government relations manager now for the district and has had a remarkable career for that organization. And the other thing I want to say is when I took the position and Councilwoman Sussman was just leaving that role on the board, the only thing she had to tell me, she came over and whispered. She said, you had the best lunches you're ever going to eat. So, yeah, they they do a good job in that way. But I do want to thank all all the former council members here, former attorney muse Mr. Reynolds, and all the family members for for what you did in setting the table so all of us can be up here working for a city that's with all of its challenges in pretty good shape. So thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. Councilmember Hines. Thank you. Council President, I this is my first term in office and I never met Miss Reynolds. Did not know her. I. Would say tonight, I want to thank the sponsors for their fabulous presentation. And and I want to thank the folks here in this room. It's just been such a delight to learn more about Ms.. Rental, Ms.. REYNOLDS And what a force she has been in our city. And I am also speaking of delight. I am delighted that she broke a barrier and helped us become, as you have already said, such a diverse council with majority women council, too. And so I just wanted to thank everyone for coming. I feel a little bit I feel like I know her a little bit better, and I'm excited to have this chambers named after her. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. Um, so I never had the honor of knowing Cathy, but I know my father, Paul Sandoval, did, and worked with her a great deal. And as a daughter of someone who was elected, I had to share my dad with the community. And I remember going places with my dad, and I would get tired of him talking to everyone. And I would just want my dad's attention. And we would go to on a cruise. I'll never forget we were in Mexico and my dad knew someone on the cruise in Mexico. And it all revolved around Denver politics. And so as a woman who is now currently elected and I have two children at home, I know the strain my dad carried and the strain that she probably carried of being a mother and being a wife and being a politician. And now I see my kids. I go places and my kids are like, Mom, come on, let's go. Do we have to keep talking? And so I just wanted to thank her family, her husband, who sat by her side. My husband's been there for me. I don't think anyone really knows what that's like. And her kids who she had, you had to share your mom with the community and what that feels like of people telling you stories about your mom that you didn't know and exploring things and hearing things. When I was campaigning, I learned more about my dad than I had known. I didn't know. I knew he had a big impact in northwest Denver, but I really learned it. Going knocking door to door and hearing. So just wanted to thank her family because this is a job where you don't get to go home when you just turn it off. You don't. You're everywhere you go. You're Councilwoman Sandoval. You're not the story. And so thank you for her family, for standing by her side for so long and standing in her, because I'm sure she needed to come home and she rented to you all, just like we all as mothers up here and fathers go home. And we went to our significant other in our kids. And so we're all in it together. And for all of you, other women who were elected, thank you for opening the door for me and for my family and for my ability to serve Northwest Denver and get things done. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval and see no other speakers in the queue. I'll go ahead and round it out tonight. I want to sincerely thank council members Flynn and Ortega for sponsoring this. And I see when Council member Flynn started to try to go down the roll call, it makes it tough. So I would just like to acknowledge and sincerely and humbly thank the former council members who are here with us this evening as well and online. You know, some of the things that were said about Kathy Reynolds tonight were she was a strong woman. She was a visionary. She was a passionate servant. She was a get it done sort of person. Her humor, her patience, her kindness and her generosity. Were things that you said over and over again in a little bit different way, but it gave us an opportunity sitting up here tonight to fill. For the ones of us that never met her, feel like we knew her just a little bit. And the humility and. Just great honor that it is to sit up here and serve our city and know the intentional work that it does take to do this job to the best of your ability and to her husband and her two children. I know a couple of my colleagues brought it up, but your sacrifices, because I think that she couldn't serve for almost 30 years and there weren't sacrifices that you all made as family. And that sacrifice changed policy and legislation in Denver for the betterment of citizens that you will never meet. But she did that and you allowed her to do that because having the support of your family members, when you go home to not talk about what happened, to talk about what happened in your life and in your day is so refreshing and so important for us to be able to continue doing our jobs and the coalition building. How she served on the the Citizen Oversight Board. Women's rights. I have two daughters and I want them to consider public service at some point. I want them to know that it's achievable for them and that they can do that and have a city or have excuse me, have a family and still serve the city in a good way, but that you're also serving your family at the same time. And so I'm very honored to support this this evening. And, Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Flynn. Just checking what the snow says. I don't have seven votes. I. Ortega, i. And we would like to ask council members who are in the chambers to all please stay so we can take a group photo with you and our seated council. I think Sandoval. Sawyer. I. Torres, I. Black. I. See tobacco. I. Clark. I. Herndon. I. Times i. Cashman. Can I? Madam President. I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results. 13 eyes. 13. I count the bill. 21 guy. 13. 20. They're being for no further business before this body. This meeting is adjourned.

Just one sec here. Okay, let's move to committee reports. Please read the first agenda item. The report of the Governance, Equity and Technology Committee Agenda Item one Council Bill 119 427 relating to the regulation of the for hire industry, removing certain considerations between an exclusive driver representative, representative and the Director of Finance, Administrative Services and many sections 6.3 10.7 35 for code and repealing rules and regulations to the extent they are inconsistent with this ordinance. Committee recommends the bill passed. Thank you very much. I'll say a few opening words about what this bill is doing and then certainly turn it over to Councilman O'Brien, who shown your strong leadership in this area. So our goal in this legislation has always been to put the city of Seattle in the best position to address the issue of what we consider fair compensation to all TNC taxing for hire drivers without compromising the ability of these companies themselves to thrive in a competitive marketplace. In light of ongoing litigation, we are amending ordinance 124968, which provides council with most flexibility and options directly and efficiently to address the issue of driver compensation. The ordinance we passed in 2015, as many of you know, have been has been tied up in court. And our introduction of this bill, 119427, we think is common sensibly allows us to look at all options on the table regarding driver compensation without any more additional litigation delays. Again, just by way of background, in December 2015, you may recall that we passed an ordinance again under Councilmember Bryant's leadership and many of us looking at these issues relating to the regulation of the transportation and for hire industry and under which for hire drivers could determine whether or not to engage in collective negotiations over various terms with companies who contract with those drivers, examples being Uber, Lyft and and taxi companies. And among other things, the ordinance that we did pass elicited certain subjects to be collectively negotiated, including best practices relative to vehicle equipment standards, safe driving practices, criminal background checks, the nature and amount of payments made to or withheld from drivers hours and conditions of work, etc.. So I was one of the many council members who supported this. And again, the legislation today are just removing as a sub subject of bargaining the nature and amount of payments received by or withheld from drivers. There's a few other technical corrections, but nothing substantive in nature. So that's what we hope to do today. And Councilmember O'Brien, I hope I left you something to say with there. I'll turn it over to you. Council President, you did a great job of summarizing that. So you didn't leave me much to say, but I appreciate your support and strong words for this. I also support this legislation and I'll just reiterate that, that by taking this action, we still, as a body, reserve the right to to set fares and standards like we do for other parts of the industry. There's no plan at the moment to do that, but it's something that we might consider going in the future. But again, as you said, just to reiterate, this still leaves most of the terms of employment or work, I should say, for these independent contractors to be subject to the collective bargaining agreement . It just takes this one item out, as you mentioned. Very good. Any comments? I mean, our colleagues and I'll just say sort of in closing that as many of these TNC companies sort of struggle or are in many cities throughout this country and actually across the world with what a regulatory. Framework looks like. I'm really optimistic that we can figure this out in Seattle. What's fair to both the drivers, those, whether the part time or full time and to the companies themselves to allow competitive choices that we could figure out what a healthy regulatory scheme looks like here. And and again, maybe other cities in this country could sort of follow our lead. And that's the work we're going to do this year. And I look forward to it. So. Can I just ask question about the schedule? What do you anticipate and when do you think we would have something for review? Yeah, I know I should have talked that much and I was going to keep the question. I'm optimistic that first quarter this year we'll be firing up the committee and looking at these issues. We're still struggling with some issues on how to get some of the data that we want and the executives on board also assisting us , trying to get data on the types of rides and the number of rides in certain areas of the city, because there are other issues in addition to the composition of the drivers that we're concerned about with how our streets look. So but I anticipate first quarter of this year, we'll be doing some work on it. Okay. Having said that, please call the role on the passage of the bill. Make sure.

Please read the report of the Gender Equity Safe Communities and New Americans Committee and you can read the short title. The report The Gender Equity Safe Communities and Americans Committee Jeanette and one Constable 118 930 Wellington City Sales Acquisition and Use of Surveillance Technologies Committee recommends the bill passes amended. Custom and Gonzales. Thank you. We have a couple of amendments. Amendment one, an amendment to a. So I'll go through those first and then talk about the substance of the bill once we have an amended version before us for discussion. So I will go ahead and start off with moving for the adoption of Amendment One aid to substitute Council Bill 118930. Second. Clinton moved in. Second, seconded to amend the base legislation with amended one eight. Comments on that one. Casper Gonzalez. Yes. If approved, this amendment would make the following changes to the base ordinance that was passed out of committee. It would require that the annual equity impact assessment in any annual city auditor or I.G. Review will be posted to the city's website. There was also a suite of technical cleanups, including deleting an obsolete reference to maintaining a list of council exemptions and the and other legal and grammatical wordsmithing at its very good. Any further questions just on Amendment one? All those in favor of a minute. One please vote i. I oppose. The ayes have it and one is passed. Okay. I now move for the adoption of Amendment two aid to Council Bill 118930. Second, it's been moved in second to pass Amendment two a comments on that one. Councilman Gonzalez. Yes. If approve this amendment, which is co-sponsored by myself and Councilmember Burgess, would make the following changes to the subject to the base ordinance passed out of committee. It makes amendments in two areas one with regard to the ITO quarterly list. And second, with retrospective approval of surveillance technologies on the CTO quarterly list, it would require that a CTO quarterly list of technologies be provided a council and the amendments clarify that the following must be included in that quarterly list. First, that all surveillance technology determinations made by an executive process, including both those determined to be surveillance technology and those determined not to be, would need to be included in this list. And the second would be a citation to all surveillance technology determinations for the previous 12 months. And then lastly, with regard to the CTO quarterly list of the Council changes of the designation of technology on the list, meaning if we move it from one category to another, that action needs to be filed with the clerk and the quarterly list needs to be updated accordingly with regard to retrospective approval of technologies. These amendments reflect the order in which our requests for existing technologies will be brought to the Council and requires that they be identified by the executive with the ability of council to revise that order. And instead of and this is in place of of the process which was originally in the base ordinance, which would require review of those technologies in order from highest privacy impact to least this amendment also includes modifies the deadline for the first surveillance impact report submittals to be by the end of the first quarter in 2018, rather than 30 days after that middle of the executive's list of existing technologies. And in addition to the proposed amendments listed into a we would like to make a technical amendment to Section two to read under the section letters accordingly. Thank you very much, says Amendment two. A Councilman Gonzalez described any questions on Amendment two. A All those in favor of a minute to a vote. I. I oppose. The ayes have it. So now we have an amended piece of the base legislation been amended. And Councilman Gonzalez, you can speak to the amended legislation. Yes. So I will move for the adoption of Council Bill 118930 as amended. Second, further comments from his office. I want to say a lot of words. Okay, here we go. This legislation repeals and replaces Chapter 1418 of the Seattle Municipal Code with the new Chapter 1418. The intent of the legislation is to govern. The city's acquisition and use of surveillance technology require a publicly transparent and accountable process for procurement and operation of surveillance technology, and establish protocols for city departments to mitigate civil liberties concerns and incorporate racial equity principles into such protocols. Key components of the legislation include but are not limited to the following requiring city departments intending to acquire surveillance technology to obtain council ordinance approval of the acquisition and an accompanying surveillance impact report requiring city departments to complete one or more community meetings related to the technology prior to requesting Council approval. Requiring departments to submit surveillance impact reports for each technology. Requesting Council approval requiring an annual equity impact assessment. Requesting annual reviews by the City Auditor and Future Inspector General for public safety. It creates a private right of action and it. That existing surveillance technologies must receive council approval over time, and it directs the creation of a work group to make recommendations on how to utilize community expertize for the purposes of advising this Council on future acquisitions of surveillance technology. So that's the basic aspects of the substance of the bill. And if there are no questions on that, then I would provide other council members an opportunity to chime in and then I would like to make closing remarks. Very good. Any further comments on this ordinance dealing with surveillance technology? Councilmember Burgess. Thank you. President Harrell. Thank you, Councilmember Gonzales, for your leadership over the last almost a year of carefully reviewing this legislation and making sure that it reflects not only our values but our intent to protect privacy, but also to allow the city to use appropriate technologies to deliver city services and maintain peace and safety in our neighborhoods. I think we've accomplished that purpose here. And I know that you've also spoken for work that you're going to take up next year. Good luck at that. And. We'll bring you back. Here. Easier said than done. On data. And how do we manage and regulate the use of data, which I think would be a good exercise to go through as well. So thank you. Any further comments, concerns one. Thank you, President Howell. I will be voting in favor of this ordinance because it is a step in the right direction. But I think we have to be clear, as several members of the community and organizations have spoken in public testimony today, that the ordinance, as will be voted on today, will not actually protect the privacy of Seattle from warrantless surveillance. The and I strongly agree with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the American Civil Liberties Union, the City of Seattle, Human Rights Commission, and others who spoke in public comment and who have written in the past that surveillance data should be included in a strong ordinance. And I know the Council has talked about it, but I think the point that was made is really important, that we need it, need it in an expedited fashion. What I find most concerning is that even though the logic of the committee discussions was towards including surveillance data, it seemed that subsequent to strong objections by the Seattle Police Department, surveillance data was removed from the bill. And that I think that needs to be addressed very carefully. Just to give an example of why this is important. Seattle claims to be a sanctuary city, so the Seattle Police Department is not allowed to share immigration status with ICE. However, if we don't have a strong position, you know, a law on surveillance data, then there's nothing to stop Seattle police from sharing personal data, hypothetically, like images of tattoos, of, you know, of individuals and something that's gathered by a convenience store security camera. There's nothing to stop the SBT from sharing such images from any number of law enforcement agencies around the country that are willing to share that information with ICE. And I think with the chilling messages that have been sent by the Trump administration, we should be doubly anxious to pass this person an ordinance that covers surveillance data. So this is an example of a consequence of omission from this bill. So I will be supporting this bill, but I really strongly support community members and organizations who have said that we need to move with all haste to close the loopholes. Thank you. Comes from a swamp. Any further comments? I'd like to just thank publicly Councilman Gonzales again and her committee for this leadership. I think we're at a time where clearly technology has gotten in front of some of our policies. We have been and I've been proposing, as many have done, proposing technological solutions to areas of transportation and public safety, environmental sustainability and education. And last week, I visited with a delegation from Kobe, Japan, a microsoft cybersecurity campus, to look at all of what's sort of going on in the world of hacking. I think Shankar talked a little bit about the the hackers conference in I and I study that and just to know how sort of scary it is some of this is state sponsored, by the way, in different countries. And and so as as employees of the city of Seattle, I think our responsibilities are are heightened in terms of both not only the information we use, but the information we furnish. And so I heard loudly and clearly, councilmember. Czar is commitment to make sure that we continue this great policy works very complex because again we are we are the technology and the software and hardware are rapidly changing and becoming more sophisticated. So I welcome that work and we certainly work with her in that regard. Any further comments on the base legislation? Want to do some wrap up comments from booksellers? I will. I just I want to just first, I'm going to start off by thanking my committee colleagues, council member Bagshaw and Burgess for sticking sticking it out with me in this very complex subject, too. And I also want to thank all of the departments who provided us feedback, not just SBT, but we heard back from our Human Services Department, from our Parks Department, from every single department about how this ordinance might impact their business operations. I want to thank them all for being responsive and getting us the information that we needed. Our Seattle City office, the mayor's office, especially David Mendoza, our city budget office, Amy CI, and Brianna Thomas, of course. Last but not least, Amy Scott and Brianna Thomas, who put a lot of time into this. And so collectively, we have spent hundreds of hours over the past eight months to get us this far. And I just want to be really clear that like Councilmember Swan and others up here in this dais, I, I also agree with the ACLU of Washington and with CARE and with the Seattle Human Rights Commission and with the many other organizations who have articulated to us a need to tackle the questions of surveillance data that are generated by the city, by the city, or by people outside of the city that have a real impact in how our communities trust us and be, and how our communities are actually impacted by policing or by other types of consequences as a result of collection of that data. And I think we all share that deep concern. And my hope is that we acknowledge that this is a Phase one approach and that this is a good first step in the right direction. And and that we will venture down the path of having a phase two. And that in that phase two, we will we will eventually be able to struggle with these issues and hopefully become the first municipality in the country to actually tackle the complex issues related to surveillance data that are disconnected from surveillance technology that we acquire and that or that we ask others to operate on our on our behalf. But the reality is, is that no other city has tackled this yet. And just because it's complex doesn't mean that we shouldn't. In fact, those are the issues that we should be tackling. And I think I hope the advocates here from the dais appear that we're all committed to heading down that path and to really making sure that we stand up a process where we can take a look at those very serious issues that are not included in this bill. But that, my hope is, will be included in a future bill as soon as as soon as we can make that happen. So I want to thank you all for staying committed to having these tough conversations and for doing so in an incredibly respectful, thoughtful way. And I know that this is just our first adventure together in this area, and I look forward to working on the bigger issues as well. Very good. Okay.

A Superseding Resolution 31883 Resolution 319 23 relating to Seattle City Council Member Participation for 2020 and 2021 on King County Committees, Regional Committee, State Committees and City of Seattle Committees and Superseding Resolution 31885. Thank you. Adam Kirk. So Resolution 3192 and Resolution 319823. Establish the committee structure and membership meeting times and duties of the Standing Committees for Seattle City Council for 2020 and 2021. It also establishes each of our participation on external committees, those being regional committees, state committees and other City of Seattle committees. For the next two years, I'm going to go ahead and move to adopt item two and then look for a second. And then once that occurs, if any of my colleagues would like to give remarks about the resolution and your committee assignment, I will go ahead and call on my colleagues for that purpose. So I will move to adopt Resolution 31922. Kate's been moved in second. Is there any of my colleagues who would like to provide any remarks or comments? Councilmember grumbled. I primarily just want to thank you and your staff for the hard work that you've done in putting together this, this resolution and our committee responsibilities and also shepherding a what will be a bit of a culture change with the establishment of new quorum rules, a higher level of participation required for committees to meet. I think the new structure will have significant demands of all of us, and I'm confident under your leadership that we will rise to the occasion. And I'm really excited about about your leadership and about the new committee structure and having a chance to to work with my colleagues and work on the issues most important to them. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, any other comments from a salon? Thank you, President Gonzalez. I intend to vote yes on this resolution, of course. And just wanted to share with members of the public that I will be chairing the Sustainability and Renter's Rights Committee, which will hold a regularly scheduled meeting on the fourth Tuesday of every month. And the issues that we will be discussing, of course, will be related to rent control, economic eviction protections, 180 days notice for rent increases, portable background checks for renters. And most urgently upcoming legislation, of course, is something that has already been introduced in the council from my office, which is the moratorium propose moratorium on winter evictions to make sure that our renting families are safe from the element in the harshest months of the year. And we will also be discussing upcoming legislation to contradict what the outgoing City Council last year already made a commitment to, which is a Green New Deal for our city. And I just wanted to make a clarification quickly. At the council briefing this morning, I announced, unfortunately, mistakenly, that my first committee will be meeting on the 20th of this month. I just remember I'm actually personally not available on that day, so we will have to revise that date and I'll make sure my staff reach out to all your offices as soon as possible. Great. Thank you, Councilman. Isn't any any other of my colleagues want to make any remarks at this point? Okay. See, none. I want to really appreciate and thank each of you for your engagement, both personally with me over many, many weeks and with my staff on talking through what would what each of your individual priorities are for the next two years. That input, I hope you see reflected in this final resolution. It's always a bit of an art, not quite a science to to pull together committee structures and committee assignments and really have appreciated and had appreciated the opportunity to engage with many of you over many weeks to take your individual input for my thinking that to be able to distill it into what I think is, is a consensus resolution before us that really does hopefully reflect not only the priorities that each of you will have in working through some of the issues that your committees will be responsible for, but also in helping us establish a different culture here at the City Council that really allows for many of the difficult policy issues to be worked through effectively and openly, in a transparent way through our new committee structure, which will now require five members and one alternate. And it will also require that at least three council members who are members of the committee attend the committee hearing in order for the committee to be able to do its business again. A bit of a culture shift for us, but it also puts some responsibility on us as chairs to ensure that we have the bodies in in the chairs to be able to inspire confidence among the public that we are taking the policy work seriously. That is our duty here at the legislative branch and that will and that we're doing that in good faith. So I really look forward to to seeing the plan executed. And again, really have appreciated your all cooperation and willingness and transparency and having conversations with me as I thought through what the committee structure could be for this year. So thank you all so much for your commitment to that. So this this resolution has been moved and has been adopted. So those in favor adopting the resolution vote i. I any opposed the motion carries and the resolution is adopted and the chair will sign it. Okay. We're going to move on to resolution 31923. I moved to adopt resolution 31923 case, been moved and seconded that the resolution be adopted. Are there any comments? So, folks, this is the resolution that relates to each of our participation for the 20 2021 for the 2020 and 20, 21 years on King County committees, regional committees, state committees and City of Seattle committees. Again, this is in large part related to our City Council Committee obligations and duties, but also has a flavor of interest that folks have in serving in other regional issues and regional committees that we get to have representation on. By virtue of being Seattle City Council member. So again, I appreciate your willingness to serve on these committees as part of our ongoing obligations as City Council members to represent our city specific interest in these regional and statewide efforts. So it has been moved and seconded that we adopt resolution 31923 those in favor of adopting the resolution vote i. I any opposed? None oppose. The motion carries in. The resolution is adopted and the chair will sign it. Okay. The Council will now discuss and consider one motion to suspend the council rules before we consider item four on the agenda. The Council rules require that the Council adopt by resolution a monthly rotation for the position of Council President Pro Tem in order of seniority and requesting that this Council rule be suspended to allow consideration of","A RESOLUTION relating to committee structure, membership, meeting times, and duties of the standing committees of the Seattle City Council for 2020 and 2021; and superseding Resolution 31883.","Step 1 - Logical Reasoning:

- The primary legislative intent is to establish the committee structure, membership meeting times, and duties of the Standing Committees for the Seattle City Council for 2020 and 2021, as well as the participation of council members on external committees.
- Key authorizations and actions include the adoption of two resolutions: Resolution 31922 establishing the committee structure, membership, and duties, and Resolution 31923 relating to the participation of council members on external committees (King County committees, regional committees, state committees, and City of Seattle committees). The resolutions outline committee responsibilities and a higher level of participation required, establish meeting schedules and roles, and highlight specific issues each committee will address. The resolution also requires three council members to attend committee hearings for the committee to conduct its business.
- No monetary amounts, locations, or specific dates are explicitly mentioned in the excerpt. The focus is on establishing the organizational structure, duties, and participation requirements for council members.

Ordered. By Microsoft on final construe. By. Consideration and. Do pass. Yes, it has been moved and seconded. Councilman Brooks, your motion to amend? Yes, I moved to amend council with 625 in the following particulars on page seven 931 under section 27, one of three definitions sub paragraph Z, Special Revenue Fund. Add the following language to the definition. Not withstanding the foregoing, the director shall adopt as part of the rules and regulations a reservation for a portion of alternative contribution payments paid by applicants from high need downtown areas as as defined in the rules and regulations. This reservation shall be held for payments for MPD use created in the same or approximate neighborhood. The reservation shall take priority over all other purposes of the Special Revenue Fund for a reasonable time as defined by the rules and regulation. Okay. Thank you, Councilman. Books for the amendment in those particulars is now time for comments from members of Council on the amendments. Councilman Brooks. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to I'm going to read. The purpose of this amendment first, and then I'm going to some other comments and also some questions. First, I want to start off by saying Councilwoman Canete has just been very gracious. And after all of the comments last week, we had a great conversation. And I just said, you know, there's still some issues that that I would love to work out. And it's about ensuring that we have these downtown units in downtown. So I'm going to read some some some particularly, but she's been great in helping me get to this point. The purpose of this amendment is to direct the Office of Economic Development to adopt the rules that define a high need downtown area, that require a portion of the payments made in lieu of building affordable units from the area. To be set aside, it directs that fund. Those funds will be set up for a reasonable period of time for the purpose of preserving or creating new affordable housing and paying incentive payments for projects that build affordable units in the defined area, downtown area, or proximate to the don't define downtown area. This this amendment is based on historical data that we receive from OED, as they reported in their annual report for the council record, demonstrating that more than 50 to 52% of its units that were lost in the cash in lieu payments came from the downtown area. Developers in all areas are treated exactly the same under this ordinance. They receive the same incentive payments. If they build, they pay the same buyout amount if they pay in cash instead of building. The only thing this amendment does is to prioritize how the city spends the dollars after they have received. After they are received, we have lost more units to buyouts from downtown than any other high area. So the amendment prioritizes dollars from the downtown for the use of the vicinity when we can in the hopes of making making up for that loss. I also want to point out that in the high zone, if you look at all of the High Zone as proposed in councilman, can each the downtown area is disproportionately affected by that high zone, meaning it's 1800 acres and it's larger than any other high zone in the city. And so for those reasons and many others, I put this amendment forward in working in partnership with Councilwoman Canete, and I hope that my colleagues will support it. I will also say in the particulars that will be in in the rules and regulations, what we're looking at is that this fund, we cannot tap into the existing FHL fund, but this is going forward any, any new projects that buy out in cash in lieu, 50% will be set aside just for this area. It would be set aside for two years, 24 months, and seeing if there's any projects that are in the pipeline, if they're not there, be distributed just as obviously economic development will do any other project. So with that, I'll take questions or comments. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Councilwoman McHugh, Councilman Councilmember Councilwoman Canete. Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to share, as the sponsor of this of this ordinance, that I support this amendment. I do appreciate Councilman Brooks working with me. And I think the spirit of allowing some of these particulars, the number of months, the percentage to be again in regulation, just like the other metrics in this ordinance , is a good way to keep consistency that we are allowing us to be more responsive. So I want to thank him for his effort. And as a sponsor, I will be supporting this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Lemon. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be supporting this amendment as well, because my goal is affordable housing is to get affordable housing near jobs. And this amendment does just that. However, I will be voting against the ordinance because I don't think that it is structured to make a significant difference. Thank you, Councilwoman Lemon. Councilwoman. Thank you. I'd like to ask the sponsor just to clarify crystal clear what proximate means. So does that means it's like the statistically. Just explain for us what that means. Yeah. So the approximate neighborhoods would be Union Station would be Arapahoe Square, it would be civic center as as defined in the bill. You know, this is you know, we can have a larger conversation. And I think this is why we wanted to not specify it and make it too prescriptive, but we wanted to make it reflective of the downtown area plan. So I just want to be clear, are are you using a broad definition of proximate are you actually trying to target a few specific neighborhoods but that you're not? We're using them within the context of the amendment. May I as as the ordinance sponsor. Mr. President, to clarify. Go ahead. Yeah. So, Councilwoman Shepard, I'm chiming in because this word proximate wasn't created for this amendment. It actually exists in the other portions of the ordinance that I worked on. So and the intent really was to allow for logic, really. And so the idea is that it's not strictly defined because what happened before is it used to say the same or adjoining statistical neighborhoods. So for example, Union Station is part of the downtown vicinity, but it doesn't touch Civic Center. And so you couldn't take a unit from Union Station and build it in Civic Center. You wouldn't you would be prohibited because it wasn't close enough. It didn't touch. So the idea was to kind of eliminate the requirement that the statistical neighborhoods have to touch and instead allow the department to make a determination. And so like many things in law, you know, it gets defined either in rules and regulations or through policies of the department. And it's specifically intended to allow for the vicinity of downtown. As as Councilman Brooks said, the downtown area plan, you know, it encompasses a area and it encompasses Arapahoe Square. So if it kind of looks and smells like it's in the area, then there's no reason for us to prohibit units from going from one part of that area to another part of the area. Thank you for the clarification. Thank you, Councilwoman Sheppard. And Councilman, can each. Councilwoman Sussman. Thank you, Mr. President. I like Councilwoman Lehman. I'm going to support this amendment, though. I'm not going to be supporting the I. So I do see this amendment as addressing one of the more serious weaknesses of the I show. And I'm happy that Councilman Brooks brought this forward. But still, I think there are other weaknesses that make me feel like I cannot support the whole I echo. Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman, do we have any other comments on the amendments seen on voting on the amendments? Councilman Brooks. Move forward, ma'am. Secretary Roll call. Brooks I round. Five. Fights no carnage i liman i Lopez II Montero I nevett i Ortega I Rob I. Shepherd i. Susman, i. Mr. President. I. Couple of thoughts. Madam Secretary, please close the line. And then after a lot. Of advice, one day. 12 hours, one day, the 65 has passed as amended. Now, Councilwoman Lehman, we need to put 65 on floor to do pass as amended. Thank you, Mr. President. I move the council. The council. It's 625. A series of 14 be placed on the floor for final consideration and do pass as amended. So it has been moved and seconded. Do we have any comments from members of Council? Councilwoman Ortega It's a question for the city attorney. Do we need to republish this? Is this enough of a substantive change that it requires that? David Broadwell, Assistant City Attorney. Since this floor amendment changes neither the title nor the description, the charter and rules do not require republication of the bill. You are free to adopt it tonight. Great. I'd like to just make a brief comment. Go right ahead. First of all, I want to thank Councilwoman Kimmich, the members of the committee that worked with her folks from our Office of Economic Development, Larry Hagman from the city attorney's office for all your work in bringing forward these changes. Councilman Brooks and I had a conversation earlier today about the amendment. The language, I think, reads that gives enough flexibility that if there is a project close enough to downtown, that will benefit workers who work downtown. I think there's that flexibility that our staff will have to ensure that we're not letting projects go by the wayside and have funds in a pot where we can't get these projects done. Again, it does not tap into the existing funds that sit in the pot of money. I think these changes are good. I know we had testimony from people who were here when we had our public hearing expressing concerns. Again, without the ordinance, we wouldn't have seen the Affordable For Sale units created that exist in the city today, many of which were. Offset, if you will. And there are units that are at some of our larger residential development at Lowry, I mean, at Stapleton and out at Gateway. But, you know, we have families that are living in those units now that have benefited from the funds that were created that help offset the cost that got families into those units. Sorry, that's my family. So I just hope that all of my colleagues will allow this to move forward. And the changes that are made, I think, will be good in terms of giving greater flexibility to our city staff to assist in the creation of units, which is really the bottom line of why this ordinance was created in the first place. It was not to encourage more people buying out. It was to encourage units to be built in this city. As we were starting to see high density development and we were starting to see units high density happen all all across the city. So thank you again, Councilwoman Canete and I will be voting yes for this. Thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Canete. Thank you, Mr. President. I will keep my substantive comments brief, but I do at the end of this process, need to thank some of the folks who really are here tonight and some of whom are not. But it involved many people getting to tonight, all of whom are critical, all of whom worked hard. Regretfully, more than one of whom missed a piece of their vacations to hit key deadlines or to be at key meetings. Please don't raise your hands. But I need to thank my staff, Laura brzezinski and Fabian. That's on it. The Office of Economic Development. Many of them were here till midnight last Monday, but they pulled data. They educated us on their internal processes and gave feedback along the way. Economic and Planning Systems. David Schwartz was here last week, our legal team, Laurie Heideman and Adam Hernandez, very integral partners every step of the way, not just in drafting, but in every step community planning and development. And we had, you know, industry groups as well as foundations that funded the economic study because we as the city didn't have the funds to fund the studies. So we fundraised for that. I appreciate all the stakeholders, many of whom voted on both sides or commented on both sides, but all of whom I appreciated being at the table from the beginning. And also the constituents. They came to meetings, they sent emails, they made calls, they engaged, they got educated, added a degree I haven't experienced previously. In my three years on council, I heard from a lot of individuals and to my colleagues who voted yes last week and to whom I hope will also be voting this week. You know, it is it is not easy to make policy without unanimity, but it is an important obligation of government. And it's one that I appreciate my colleagues joining me in. We make this policy tonight and I'll just you know, the two summaries from last week were one simply stated, without this ordinance, homes would not be built at this income level. They just wouldn't. So we know that zero homes we built at this income level, without it, we can debate how many, whether there could be more. But period, no homes would get built at this income level without these this ordinance, the complex part, this ordinance does balance a bunch of interests and it lowers production requirements in ways that benefit developers. And that balance is a hard one to achieve. And this is the best balance that we could do in this city. We could create a lot more units if we gave up some of those pieces that impact developers less. But we've chosen not to intentionally, out of respect for the role that private development plays in our economy and the importance of them being able to produce the market rate units. So it's a tough balance, but this ordinance does achieve it. The last thing that I think it requires underlining is the phenomenal thing that occurred in this chambers a week ago, which is that out of 23 speakers, almost every single one of them was unified in the importance of this city. Taking a bigger next step for resources. We have heard from our residents. We every year survey thousands of residents about the city and county of Denver, and we asked them what they like about the city and what their least favorite characteristics are. And last year, the least favorite characteristic our residents noted was the affordability of housing in this city. This is not just about poverty, it is about poverty, but it's not just about that. That issue resonated with all of our constituents. Thousands, thousands of residents were surveyed. The mayor's housing advisor. There have been many mayors and there have been many advisory committees, and each and every one of them has said we need to focus on a revenue source as long ago as 2006. That has been a priority from advisory experts. This council has spoken twice in our annual priorities, stating that revenue is really important. We have a moment, can't create a moment, but sometimes you find yourself in a moment. And, you know, I think that I really have to call on the mayor. We're going to debate in a few minutes his first investment, $3 million into a new fund. And that's really important. But I call upon the mayor to hear the moment that's been created, to hear the unanimity among diverse voices, and to help lead us. We have many ideas. There are many paths we can take, but we do need him to lead us that next step. And I think that we'll have plenty of others that have, at least in the debate last week, said, I'd love to serve on that issue committee or work on that topic. So we have new leaders emerging to join you and that but we need you and I implore you this week that that be something we don't wait on. There are many things the city is always working on, but you don't get moments like this very often. And so I hope that we take it this ordinance tonight. This is about school teachers. It's about security guards, and it's about some of the folks who make our city run. And it's about homeownership. And I am proud of that. It's one piece of the puzzle. And for that one piece of the puzzle, I ask for your votes and support tonight. And I thank all of you who work to help us bring it. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Kennedy. Councilman Brooks. Thank you, Mr. President. Councilwoman McKinney, I feel bad that I didn't mean to get the last word. I wanted to say something before you did, but those are beautiful words. I'll just say this. You know, I met with a lot of folks around this bill, those who were in favor and those who were in opposition. And unfortunate thing. I met with them all in the last week and a half. And I would love I would love to have this be a serious conversation going forward, because the leading thinkers on cities, the the the the urban, the urban ideologists all talk about affordable housing being the number one component to sustainability of the city . And if we don't figure this out in Denver, we're going to be in trouble. And so I want to just put a public service announcement out to all those folks that I met with, many who emailed me, let's figure this out and let's do this together. And I know some folks feel like they want some folks feel like they lost in this debate. But there's a bigger there's a bigger call coming up. This this housing trust is is the big one for the city of Denver. And we've got to figure it out. And so, you know, I just I really call on those folks and then, you know, I echo Councilwoman Canisius call to to the mayor for such a time as this. Now now's the time. We need you. We need the mayoral administration to be on board. This is going to be a big deal. And we need to come to the table. And and I thank you for all those individuals who who came last week who said that they want to be at the table and you will be called on. So thank you for that. And I will say that the mayor has brought a small group of individuals to start looking at the sustainable funding, looking at sources to to get this trust fund going. And and so he has done that. But I think that conversation needs to be brought out into the community. I think there needs to be key stakeholders at the table to make this a reality as well. And lastly, I just want to just highlight comes from can each you know, and this is leadership. You don't always agree in leadership. And and Councilwoman Canete has taken some serious arrows. And as a leader, I just appreciate the way that she's she's kind of walked in the midst of this. And so I want to thank you for your leadership. And we are up here at the dais will not always agree, but we we certainly have to respect leadership and we certainly have to respect those who move from a deep place. And she's certainly done that with this bill. And so I think all of my colleagues as well the conversation although we. Beat this council. Bill, what is it? 625. Like a horse to midnight. The the the debate was rich, and it made me proud of my colleagues up here. So thank you all for for really taking this serious. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilman Brown. Thank you, Mr. President. Just as a reminder to my colleagues. Affordable homes are being sold every day in our city. Every day. According to the MLS, what is known as the metropolis. Who keeps tabs of this last year in terms of attached and detached residential properties in Denver only not metro Denver and Denver only. There were 13,724 sales, 13,724 attached, and these detached residential property sold in Denver. Of that number, 7861 were below $300,000. That's 57% year to date. There have been 9039 attached and detached properties sold in Denver. Of the 9039 sold so far this year, 4993 were under $300,000. That's 55% affordable. Homes are being sold every day in our city, to be sure, these are not brand new homes with huge H-2A fees, I might add. Many of these are being sold as fix ups. People buy an ugly duckling and turn it into a swan is called sweat equity. And that's how many of us, including me, got into initially buying homes. I've never lived in a new home and everyone I bought, I fixed up. I saved and fixed up. Saved and fixed up. But that term sweat equity, you don't hear. And that's part of what made our country great. And it's missing. And that's why I'm not going to support this bill. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Brown. Councilman Lopez. Thank you, Mr. President. I really appreciate the comments of the folks who went before me. And I really appreciate Councilman Brown's comments as well, too. I would just reply with a challenge, and that would be another question. Affordable for whom? $300,000 is still a lot of money for a home, and there's a lot of people who in Denver cannot even afford that. There's a lot of folks in the recession. In oh eight, oh nine and 2010 that lost their homes. After all that sweat equity, they lost their homes, everything they had. They lost those folks when we saw those names. And I met regularly with Stephanie O'Malley, who was our Kirkland recorder at the time. I saw the list. A lot of people of color and in neighborhoods that were hit the hardest. And it was to neighborhoods to tell to the neighborhoods that really, really got hit hard. Two areas of town below Green Valley Ranch in Westwood and Barnum Little Park. And these are neighborhoods that we think had affordable housing. Well, in some of those neighborhoods during the recession, it was $90,000 for a home, 100 and 110, I think I remember buying my first home on that home now is over $200,000. And do you think those folks who lost their homes in foreclosures can come back and buy that house that they bought for 110 or 90 or 120? I'll come back and throw down 200 grand on a home. I don't even think they'd be able to walk in and get a loan. As a matter of fact, there's a lot of discrimination and a lot of a lot of unethical practices at the bank. When you walk up and you look like somebody from the West Side or from East End and try getting a loan. There's still a lot of uphill battles. There's still a lot of issues that this bill does not address. We scratched the surface with this bill, but let's be real. There is a huge lack of affordable housing for a lot of people. And these are folks who originally have called Denver home for decades and no longer can call Denver home because it's unaffordable. I'm sure I absolutely believe in sweat equity. You folks the opportunity to make things happen, to build the American dream and their home, and they will do it. But unfortunately, a lot of those old homes that you're seeing that are being bought up, folks are renovating, they're not staying there. They're turning around and selling it, making a lot more, and they're not selling it. The folks I'm talking about. And it's become increasingly hard. And it is a problem in Denver when you cannot afford a house in Westwood, Farnham or Globeville. Oh, that is a problem in Denver. And we have a problem. That's just the for sale market when it comes to rentals. Somebody's got to pay for all that granite countertop they put in there and those new homes. Someone's got to pay for that. And that goes on the backs of the renters. It is impossible to find a one bedroom apartment or a two bedroom home or even a three bedroom home. It's impossible to find a three bedroom home for a thousand bucks. And some of these neighborhoods. This is a family. And that's why we need these units built. That's why this is important. I did not like the bill at first because it lets people opt out and lets themselves buy their way out of this. And I don't like that idea. But as my colleague, Councilwoman Kenney, said, this is a mixture of values. This is a reflection of everybody at the table. This is sausage being made. And I as much as I am unhappy with some components of the bill because I don't think they address the problem even one bit. I think this is better than the current. I show that we have that everybody loves to complain about. Everybody takes their kick. This I might as well be happy, not the hanging for everybody to hit with no treats in it. So we might as well if there's something in front of us. And it's not perfect, but it's a fix. This is better than the status quo. This isn't a vote to reauthorize the H0. This is to improve it. You like it the way it is, which I don't know anybody that does. Then vote no. If you want to improve it, if you want a little bit better than what it is and vote yes. The status quo is unacceptable. Thank you, Mr. President. I am in full support of this bill. Thank you, Councilman Lopez. Councilwoman Commissioner. Thank you, Mr. President. And I want to thank my colleague, Councilman Brown, for raising what's a really fair question about the number of market rate homes. We actually did ask the economists this question and you know the results. BBC research has clearly documented the drop in housing below 300,000 each year that's occurring so that the trend is a downward trend. A number of the new homes being built, infill homes. And you all have seen this in neighborhoods. Right. Are replacing those homes. So the duplex that used to be 180 is now gone. And instead there is a large, you know, 600,000 duplex in its place. So that is a documented trend. And then lastly, sweat equity doesn't buy you a new furnace and it doesn't buy you a new sewer, which as an old homeowner, I'm living my life today. You know, I can do some things yourself. But old homes and and our Denver Urban Renewal Authority knows this very well because they administer the program where moderate income families who have major failures on old homes go and they have ten times more demand than they can serve. Moderate income families may be able to get into a fixer upper, but they can't repair their way out of it. And so so I appreciate the concern and and the point about the older home stock. Lastly, I will just say that, you know, the you I just want to give everyone a really specific amount. This ordinance builds homes beginning at $140,000 for a studio. All right. And, you know, 150 for a one bedroom, 190 for a two bedroom. So that's a world of distance between those numbers and 300,000. So if you were to look specifically at those price points, which are economists did do the age of the housing stock is extraordinarily old and the repair costs are pretty astronomical for moderate income families in this price range. So it's about the trend, it's about the actual price and it's about what you can really afford to maintain. So we did look at those questions because I do think they're fair and they're important. And so this is this ordinance reverses the trend of new production because eventually new production will be where the market is. Thank you. Thank you.

Hi, Madam Secretary. Please close the voting. Announce the results. 12 hours. 12 hours. Resolution 185 has been adopted. Madam Secretary, if you could please put the next item on our screens. And, Councilmember Hines, will you please put Resolution 186 on the floor? Mr. President, I move that council is at 186. I move the council resolution 20, dash 186 be adopted. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded. Comments by members of Council. Council Member CdeBaca. Thank you, Mr. President. And just for background on this change. This rule in particular caused a lot of disagreement around keeping or getting rid of the word impugn, because I personally believe that we have a job to question the decision making of our colleagues. And so in order to mitigate the the contention, I think it's important for us to operate from common definitions. Therefore, what this is doing is adding a common definition of what impugn is to mean, so that we're codifying that definition and have something to look back on and stand on when we believe that somebody has inappropriately impugn someone. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Flynn. I thank Mr. President. This is one of those items that had been amended out of the proposed resolution for further discussion at committee by agreement of everyone there. So I was again surprised to see that it was moved to the floor with some changes. But I think those changes, Councilwoman, should be discussed, particularly the councilwoman, which had some issues with it as well, and she had to leave the meeting here tonight. And so I would make a motion to refer this to committee so that we can discuss. I believe that your changes here are going in the right direction. After you and I had a conversation about one of the common meanings of impugn that would seem to prevent us from questioning a person's set of facts or data. And certainly we don't want to inhibit that. But I think we do want to maybe be a little more thoughtful and intentional about this new definition that you've put in when you filed this on Thursday. And we have not had a chance to discuss this should go back to committee so that we can discuss it and make it right. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. All right, so we have a motion on the floor to refer which has been seconded. So we'll do questions and comments on the motion to re refer. Council member said welcome. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to respond to Councilman Flynn's request to re refer. I actually incorporated the discussion that we had in committee to define impugn. And so that is why it says for the purposes of this section, impugn means to verbally assault, threaten or harass another through a knowingly false statement made with malice to unjustly that unjustly harms their reputation. That took into consideration the definitions discussed the first time we voted on the rules, as well as the concerns and definitions that were thrown out during committee. This is to say that this is what this means, because this is not the definition. I believe this this is not the definition of impugn that I understand or agree with. And so in order for me to feel like this is a rule that I can follow, defining it is very important to me. And I feel like if we could get this on the books tonight, I would be happy with someone coming forward in committee and bringing a change to it. Because I asked during committee where we're supposed to do the work if anyone would propose a definition themselves. And I got no proposal of a definition, and so I'm forced to define it in the way that I've heard others define it and put something forward and allow somebody else to respond to it the way that I've had to respond to these rules as a whole. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember Flynn thing, Mr. President, comes from what you've what you've laid out. There is a fantastic case for having this discussion in committee, because I think people did want to react and doing it here on the floor on Monday night, particularly with one of the members who had a particular problem with this. Not being present is is not the best place to do that. For instance, in the definition that you've proposed, you you wanted to limit impugn to making a knowingly false statement. And I have been the object of statements that were unknowingly false. And so I do want to refine it further and have a better discussion on it. But I agree with some of your concerns about the broad definition of impugn and how it would seem to prevent us from questioning another member's statements of fact. I'm fully on board with that. I think we can get there, but I think it should be in committee and we can we can work that out. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Hines. Thank you, Mr. President. The only additional comment that I would say is that we're we're a council of 13. And and I recognize that at that committee hearing, we didn't we didn't offer a definition. I know I was concerned because I had a meeting immediately after that committee meeting. And so but I, I am interested in hearing the discussion as opposed to I think that you're making a good a new definition for that, for impugn. But I would like to have this consultation with my colleagues. And because it's a consultation about policy, it should be in a public forum like a committee. Thank you, Councilmember. All right. See nobody else. I'll just add number one again. I really want to thank you, Councilmember CdeBaca, for being willing to come from where you started to take that feedback that was provided in committee and come back with it. You know, I was one of the people was very open to definitions and the definitions section. I really appreciate that. I think just the piece that was missing for me was that opportunity to provide feedback on the definition before we're here doing it. And so I think, you know, it's something as simple as sending out an email, not for a group discussion, but give me feedback back on, Hey, this is the definition I'm thinking, do you like it? And then you could come report to us, Hey, I sent out an email or got feedback from the 13 of you and now here I am with the definition that everyone got I was on board for. As part of that, I think that can happen in committee. I think that you could solicit feedback, you know, on this proposal, lots of proposals that lead up to that, but allow that to happen before we're here on Monday night. And so I think, again, I like where we're headed. I don't know that we're there quite yet and I'm eager to hear that. So I think committee is a great place to do it. And so I'm supportive of the motion to refer now to Secretary Roll Call on the referral. FLYNN Hi. BLACK Hi. CDEBACA No. GILMORE All right. Herndon I. Can't. I. Cashman I. Can eat. Sorry.

All right. And I thought we might have Andrew Thomas here. All right. Hello, Mr. Thomas. Are you presenting, I take it? Yes. I'll make this quick as well. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, just fine. All right. I'm Andrew Thomas. Planning building and transportation director at the council may remember that the city council, the planning board and staff have been working very hard over the last three or four months on what we all know as the Boat Works project. In March, the City Council took an important action to really resolve over 15 years of disputes and really move this project forward so we can finally get that new housing and waterfront access that we've been talking about for many, many years of the boat work site located on Clement at the corner of Oak. So there's been a number of actions that we've all been working on over the last few months. In March, the council approved the settlement agreement. In April, the council, a planning board, and the council in two separate meetings recommended and then adopted the development plan, tentative map and other entitlements for the project. At that time in April, the Council may remember that there was a request from the applicant for a waiver of universal design requirements. Staff did not recommend that waiver. At that time, we felt it was premature because there's a process laid out in the ordinance for that, for the consideration of those waivers and that process hadn't been followed. So the council approved the entitlements in April, but not the waiver. In May, the applicant began working with staff and brought their waiver to the Disability Commission for review and comment. The Disabilities Commission's job is to advise the. Planning Board. On these types of waivers. So their recommendations went to the Planning Board on May 11th. The Planning Board considered a recommendation to approve the waiver from staff with a list of conditions that had been negotiated with the applicant. At that meeting, the Planning Board added a few more conditions with the intent of making all of the units more adaptable and the Planning Board believed, based on the conversations that occurred with the applicant at the meeting, that the applicant was was comfortable with those conditions. The Planning Board under fully understands the history of this project and the many years of of dispute. So they were working hard to try to work something out that would improve the project but also be acceptable to the applicant. But, you know, as these Zoom meetings go, communication was a little bit difficult, I think. And shortly after, a few days after the meeting, the boat works team realized that there were a few of the conditions they couldn't live with and they needed to request some amendments to those to those conditions. So their only recourse at that point was to appeal to council the proposed adjustments to the Planning Board's additional conditions. Staff is recommending that you approve changes this. If you do and uphold their appeal request, then that will be really a major milestone in moving this project towards completion. And for from staff's perspective, we it was disappointing that we weren't able to do better with the universal design requirements, but to do so would require a complete redesign of this project. And given the history of the project and given all the work that's been done by all the boards and commissions over the last few years, that that just we can't recommend going trying to go back that way. And we just think it would lead to more dispute and argument. So we're recommending you uphold the appeal and make the adjustments to the conditions as shown in the attached remarks. But that I will do my presentation and I'm available to answer any questions that the board may have. Excuse me, the city council may have. I think we also have representatives from the boat works team. They're here to answer questions if you need them. They don't have any comments to make at this time. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. And I think, Councilmember Belton, I see your hand up for your hand. Okay. Um, so any questions of Mr. Thomas and seeing then, Madam Clerk, do we have any public. Speakers here remembered? Have one quick comment on the zoom. I was muted. Sorry, I. All right. Hello, Miss Kenny. Hello. Thank you for having me tonight. I want to give you a little bit more context of what happened at the Commission on Disability. We recommended against grabbing this way. This waiver represents a gutting of the universal design, and the presenting materials presented by the works did not demonstrate how this was financially feasible. It definitely would cost time and we have a commission definitely want to keep things moving. As far as we understand, there's a housing crisis. But at this point. This waiver, when it was brought to us, lacked sincerity. As far as one of the things I asked is, are there ways that we can have accessibility through the garage? That's one of the things that the planning board asked them to. Look into in. Section three, that they're asking as part of their waiver on what the. Planning. Board asked them to do. If you can have an. Entrance through. Another door to the garage, that opens up townhomes. To people the way. That this boat works. Design Right now, almost every universal design unit is going to be in the affordable housing building. None of the townhomes would be accessible or vegetables. And. The so the fact that the commission did not want this, we understood that given the litigious nature of the works. It was likely to go through. We asked for them to consider other ways that they could include accessibility. The fact that we're now here because they didn't want to even consider concluding those other ways speaks to the concerns that we had in the first place. This is the attempt to go the universal design or news and ask. To increase. Process on the part of the disabled community. This is not. This this there's. No demonstration here of why they can't even consider as the project develops, seeing how they can create opportunities for entrance into a unit so that somebody can come in, but they don't want to do that. That's what they're asking you to do tonight. I think that the section that they're asking you to leave it under is really interesting because it says for affordable housing costs. Now, all of nine of the concepts that they're asking you to rate tonight have to do with the affordable housing section of this development. It all has to do with the townhomes. And the. Single family. Homes. This time. That is not the issue. And your time is up. Thank you, Miss Kenny. Do anybody else a speaker who has raised their hand. Okay. Shona Armstrong. All right. And okay. Ms.. Armstrong is with the applicant, correct? Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. Ms.. Armstrong. Hi. I just wanted to respond to the comment that the applicant is very willing to consider and look at additional accessibility possibilities. The letter from the engineer that accompanied the request for the waiver laid out the limitations, and he worked really hard at trying to figure out how to make them maximally accessible, given the layout that's been approved through this complex process that we've all been a part of the problem. One of the big problems is that accessible and visible under the code actually doesn't allow for access through the garage. It has to be accessed through the door. So while there could well, someone could get in through the garage, it doesn't qualify under the law. And so that's why we're asking for this waiver. But we're very open and will be looking for opportunities to provide additional accessibility. We just. Given the layout that has been very. Laboriously worked out at this point, I can't promise that it will meet the specifics of the code in every respect. Thank you. All right. Anything further? No, thanks. Thank you, Mr. Armstrong. Madam, quick, do we have any further comments? Public comments? No, we have none. All right. And Mr. Thomas, back to you. Did you want to add anything? No, I don't think there's anything to add at this point. I apologize. I didn't mean to misrepresent the disability commission. They were very concerned with the design for sure. And I think from from staff perspective, you know, one of the big problems with this project and it's not an inherent yes, it is an inherent problem. I mean, we designed this project in 2011. Those of you who've been around with us, you know, we weren't thinking about universal design in 2011. We're just starting to what we're resolving tonight, if we move this forward, if the council moves us forward, is really resolving a series of issues that have revolved around that project. If we were starting from scratch, we would probably and had the luxury of being able to completely redesign the project today. We probably could do better from a universal design perspective. I'm sure we could, but as I said earlier, that we're just really staff doesn't feel the city has the luxury to be able to say, hey, let's just start over. I think what we've been trying to achieve over the last few months is, well, let's let's complete this, let's finish, move on. And I think the last thing I would say is I think we as a community can stay committed to our universal design audience. This I hope this project is an anomaly, not, you know, a new standard. And just for my clarification, so what Ms.. Armstrong said and I thought I'd read it in the staff report, is that it is still possible to enter a unit through the garage, that some of the town hall units. That's on on a number of the units have everything. Needed to. Be universal design. The issue is meeting the grade for a wheelchair to get from either the alley or the sidewalk into the unit. And if you do a strict interpretation of the slopes and does that meet the requirement that I think believe the 5% grade? No, that does not on either side. I think what Shauna is describing is and. The engineers that work with each. Unit as we move through the process, they can look at literally each house. I mean, we're now we're talking about a foot, a couple inches here, there, and the grading that can make the difference so that it. Would meet the. Legal standard. I mean, if you're good in a wheelchair, you're going to be able to get into this unit. But does it meet a legal standard? That's sort of the ADA standard for 5%. No, it does not. But if I recall correctly, and I'm just revisiting this staff report, this is I mean, there is still a percentage of units that have the excess. Yes. Yes, it. Is. Let me just clarify for the record, I think the standard in our ordinance, 30% universal design. This project is 15%. And then the other standard in our ordinance is 100% visibility. And this project has 50% visibility. So it's essentially it's getting 50% of the requirement both both both criteria. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Counsel Comments. He doesn't want to be councilmember. Councilman. Oh, I'm sorry. Miss Weiss, are you telling me something? We were just. Mr. McGillis, I think he's representing the project. He was wanting to comment, I think, but I didn't know if he was clarifying a point or we're not exactly sure. Robert Okay. Do you think he's. I don't know. Okay, well, counsel, hold your thoughts. What? We just finished a public comment and if indeed we support everybody. Hello? Can you hear me? Appreciate your time tonight. I just wanted to point out a couple of things related to extensibility. It's important for. Research. For those of us who don't quite recognize your name, although it looks familiar, could you just tell us who you are and how you're feeling? I think no worries. My name is Robert McGinnis. I'm one of the project architects for the project. I've been working with city staff Andrew Thomas for years on this project, hoping to get some this project realized to the benefit of the community. I just wanted to point out to the council members and members of the public who might not realize that this project, as proposed, far exceeds the state of California's accessibility. The challenge we had was recognizing the universal design ordinance and some of the criteria there. And so I think the painting of a picture that we're not trying to do or achieve accessibility may be misconstrued by some of the comments that were made. But we're certainly we tried after the planning board made some recommendation recommendations to accommodate those things. And so we did work as much of that as we could back into the current proposal. So I think it's important to note. Thank you. All right. Anything further? No, that's all. Thank you for your time. Thank you. All right. And, Madam Clerk, any. Any further public speakers? That was all. Thank you. Okay. Okay. So I know I was calling on someone. Councilmember Odie. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Mayor. So this is a question for Mr. Thomas. And if you don't know the answer, that's fine. Um, my other projects that we've approved prior to the universal design, I mean, what are their numbers? Because this is, what, 15 and 50, right? Yeah, I know. The the other, the more recent project, which I don't have the exact numbers, was the Pulte Alameda Landing Waterfront Project, about 350 units. I forget their exact, uh, uh, universal design numbers, but I believe it was also around 15%. Now they had the benefit of a development agreement where we had pre-negotiated the 15%, but that was all done before we did our universal design ordinance. So but it adds, you know, it's it does come back to the that project as well is a lot of townhomes and the townhomes are very difficult to get the visibility. The other great example is Alameda Marina. Alameda Marina, if you remember, about 700 units total, about half in multi-family housing, you know, stacked flats with elevators. The other half and townhomes they doubled are universal design standard. Because of that housing type, they were able to get not 30%, but 50%. Now, on the townhomes, they struggled and they had to come to the disability commission planning board for a waiver on the visibility because that's 100% requirement and it affects the townhomes as well. So, you know, I think if you're doing a multifamily building with elevator, our ordinance is not hard to meet. If you're doing townhomes, it's really it's very problematic. Okay. Thank you. Any further questions or comments? Emotion. I was vice mayor. I'm happy to make a motion to, but I'm just a quick comment. I appreciate Mr. and Mrs. Kenney and Mr. Thomas making very cogent arguments for why townhomes are a housing type that doesn't meet a number of our city goals. Unfortunately, there are also the housing type that tends to pay for the infrastructure and the projects, and so we end up having to pay for those. As somebody who in and I know a number of us did work really hard on the universal design. It is not easy to, you know, kind of grant waivers like this. But as Mr. Thomas pointed out, this is a project that we've been working on since 2011. I think we have had very good success on projects where we they come in and they know that the universal design ordinance is there or we set out the goals ahead of time. And I certainly don't think that this is a project where we're going to be able to go back and easily recreate it from scratch in order to do that to meet the new update updated ordinance. So with that, I would be I would move for approval of the staff recommendation to make the amendments to grant the waiver. All right. Thank you. We have a motion to have a second. I will reluctantly. Second. Okay. Councilmember Ody has seconded any discussion. I will just say that I read this staff report carefully. Actually, a couple of times. And I. I deeply appreciate the work that our Commission on Persons with Disabilities does. And they are all very committed individuals. I, I also understand the struggles that this project grapples with. And I was convinced from reading the staff report in the supporting documents that a good faith effort has gone into this and that the the intentionality is there. I and I I'm also heartened by the fact that there it is possible to enter through the garage. So even though in some of the townhomes, depending on the grade. But so even though that can't be counted towards meeting code, it's, you know, it would offer some visibility. But I do think that best efforts have been made. I think this is one area where I would say to consider not to make the perfect the enemy of the good, because we have struggled for a long time to get housing built in this very, you know, desirable location close to public transit. And and again, we we do have universal design and visibility, just you not the the the maximum percentage. So I am fully prepared to support and I see Councilmember Village hand up. Councilor Vella. Yeah. I just want to also note that my expectation, based off of what was said at tonight's meeting, is that there are going to be continued efforts at that. And I think that that's important, important for us to note and for staff to continue to follow up on which I know they will to to see how we can we can make the units as functionally as functionally universal as possible, even if it's not following the letter of our ordinance. Okay. Thank you. I'm prepared. Thank you. All right. Thank you. And Councilmember. So I guess your hand up. Great. Well, thank you. Just quickly, um, I will continue to vote no on this project for the reasons that I voted no before. Um, but as I was writing my notes with my head down, I do want to acknowledge that when Ms.. Kenny had to say was very powerful, some of the the the the the that her phrase is increasing profits on the back of the disabled community. Um, it's something that we shouldn't lose sight of. And I, and I know that this council won't do that, but, um, but as we go forward with other projects at that, that is something that keep in mind. So thank you. Thank you. And Councilmember Odie. I'll also be brief. And just like Councilmember de Song, I also write down notes with people's names and what what they say. So I because some of them I want to refer to later, later in the discussion. But, you know, like you, Madam Mayor, I had a read this a couple of times to really digest it and again. Right. Yeah, it didn't really sit well in the beginning. But you know, after speaking with Mr. Thomas about it, um, and also understanding that, you know, this has Mr. Thomas said this was a project that originally was approved in 2011, so nine years ago. I do want to say that both works people know. Uh. If we approve this, it's, you know, another example of this council turning the page from the years of litigation. And I appreciated the comments by Ms.. Armstrong, and I'm going to trust that they're sincere and that they will continue to work with our staff because, you know , I know I have turned the page on the relationship with ThoughtWorks and I think our city has done a good, a good job doing that. And you know, one good faith effort should be responded to in kind by another good faith effort. So I'm going to hope we can't pin them to anything, but I hope that they will continue to talk about this in good faith. And that's really all I have to say. Thank you, Councilman Brody. All right. Everyone spoken who wants to speak? And I, too, believe that we we in the works are turning the page together. And I think that there's so much potential and soon to be realized. So with that, we've had. Okay. I forgot who moved, who seconded. I realize you're not quite right. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, more coffee? Okay. Maybe we have a roll call vote, please. Councilmember de SAG. I know. Not quite. Hi. Odie. Yes. Bella. Yes. Mayor as he Ashcraft. Yes. That carries 4 to 1. All right. Thank you. And thank you to all of our speakers and staff. Let's work and let's go. Okay, so we are to keep moving. Counsel, it's almost 9:00, but you are doing well. We've covered a lot of territory and we're moving on to six D Madam Clerk.

It has been moved and seconded. The public hearing for Council Bill two eight is open. May we have the staff report? Thank you, Mr. President. Pro Tem Council members. I'm Andrew Webb from Community Planning and Development. And this is a proposed rezoning of properties at 3649 East 40th Avenue and 3600 East 41st Avenue. They are located in Council District nine in the Elyria and Swansea neighborhood. The rezoning consists of two parcels side by side, about just a little over one and a half acres, and one of the properties does have about a 9000 square foot building on it. The proposal is to rezone these properties to C-Max five, that is the Urban Center Neighborhood District mixed use with a maximum height of five stories . The existing zoning on the property to the west is CMU ten with waivers. That's a former Chapter 59 mixed use zone district. And the waivers allowed additional allow additional industrial and construction uses. Among other things, the property on the East is currently zoned IAU oh two. That is a light intensity industrial district. And the oh two overlay is the overlay that allows for billboard uses. And this proposed rezoning does not intend to preserve the use of two overlay surrounding zoning as a mix of a single unit to the West and the Southeast. And then some mixed use rezoning has already occurred closer to the 40th and Colorado station to the north. The existing land uses in the area are primarily residential or I'm sorry, primarily industrial with a mix of single and two unit residential in the direct area of the rezoning, with a single unit to the more single unit neighborhoods to the west and to the southeast and industrial directly to the south. This area gives you a feel for the built environment in this area. As you can see, adjoining the west edge of the property. Here is the former market lead railroad spur trench. And then to the north is a landmark food silo, grain storage facility development in the air. And the area currently is relatively low scale, a mix of one and two story buildings and some small scale residential. As you can see, there is primarily vacant land on the subject site and then an auto dealership and a few other industrial uses generally in the neighborhood. The proposed CSX five district promotes dense, mixed use centers with moderate to high building heights and is intended for areas redeveloping around rail stations with a mix of retail, residential, commercial and office uses. The informational notice of receipt for this application went out in January. All of the required written and posted notification has been provided for this rezoning. The Planning Board considered it in March and unanimously recommended its approval. There are quite a few registered neighborhood organizations that consider this property to be within their boundaries. All have been notified at several stages in this rezoning and we've not received any formal comment from Arnaud's. As you're aware, to adopt a rezoning, the Council must find that the proposal is consistent with these five criteria from the Denver zoning code. Regarding the first consistency with adopted plans, there are three plans that impact this site. Of course, the Denver Comprehensive Plan and Blueprint Denver and then the Elyria and Swansea and Neighborhoods Plan adopted in 2015. This proposed rezoning would further several policies contained in the comprehensive plan generally around development and redevelopment of compact mixed use areas around transit that allow people to meet multiple needs in one place with a minimum of driving and for updating and clarifying zoning in the city. Moving away from former Chapter 59 zoned districts, the blueprint plan highlights this area or identifies this area for future land use of transit oriented development and identifies it as an area of change. The future street types include a mixed use arterial and an enhanced transit corridor corridor on 40th Avenue and then a mixed use arterial arterial on Jackson Street, heading up toward the the freezing Colorado RTD station, both of which would support this type of higher intensity. Mixed use development. The Elyria and Swansea Neighborhoods Plan identifies this area also for transit oriented development in the area surrounding the 40th and Colorado station and recommends a five storey maximum building height for development here. Additionally, the Elyria and Swansea Neighborhoods Plan identifies this particular area as part of a transformational effort to occur over time in this neighborhood to redevelop the OR to fill and potentially redevelop the old market lead trench and reconnect Monroe Street there between 41st and 40th Avenues and essentially reconnect the street grid in this area. With regard to the second criteria, this request will result in a uniform application of the CMC's zoned districts. Regulations on building, form and design further furthers the public health, safety and welfare by implementing adopted plans and policies for walkable development that supports transit oriented areas. And with regard to justifying circumstances. CPD agrees with the applicant's proposal that the land or its surrounding environments have has has changed due to ongoing redevelopment near the 40th and Colorado station and with regard to the fifth criteria. This request is consistent with the neighborhood context zone, district purpose and intent. The Urban Center Neighborhood context is intended to provide active, pedestrian, scaled and diverse areas of activity near near transit stations. So with that, CPD does recommend approval based on a finding that all these review criteria have been met, and I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you very much. We do have four individuals signed up to speak this evening. If you could make your way up to the front, Dan O'Brien, you'll be first and Christopher. So you will be right after Dan. Dan O'Brien, you have 6 minutes. Go ahead. Dan O'Brien, architect with President's Design Group based here in Denver. And I've been working with the property owners to help work through the rezoning process. The property has been used for business purposes, for construction company, and with the completion of the transit line, you know that they've recognized that that particular use is probably not a long term use for this property anymore. And so they're just trying to restructure the land so that it's set up better for redevelopment. In response to the transit line being located nearby. And that's really kind of the summary of the situation. Thank you very much. Christopher Kelly. You're up next. And after that, Jesse Paris. I am Christopher Seller and I'm the owner of this land along with my brother and a partner. And so just what Dan said, we. Looked at rezoning this land the last couple of years. It seems like Cemex five is a good, good way to go and. I didn't have anything to add but that. Thank you very much. Jesse Paris. And after that, we'll be chairman school. Good evening again. Members of Council. I am against this. Could you just say your name for the record? My name is Jesse Paris with Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense and Denver Homeless out loud. I'm against this. Once again, this is another example of gentrification. My question is if this is going to be a mis mixed use residential property, how many units are going to be between 0 to 60? Am I and how many units are going to be involved? And also, who is going to occupy this property? Yeah. So that's aloha. Thank you. Our last speaker is chairman. Chairman CQ. Yes. My name is Chairman Sekou Flex. Lyrics Movement. Self-defense. Okay. We support this this change. And it's been considerably discussed within our organization. And part of what is really happening here is. Folks are scared. When you talk about going from an industrial zoning. Too mixed use and want to build 12 stories up. Doesn't sound like we're talking about building in a. Think other than housing, but I'm sure there's going to be some commercial use at the bottom and whatnot. So when you do these zoning changes like this, there's an anticipation of future property worth going to selling, especially with the developments that are going on now. So this is where in these zoning changes where it may be considered inappropriate to kind of forecast in the future about where folks are going to be doing because they're not really outlining what they're getting ready to do, but they've been thinking about it for a while. There's a certain piece in that that says, okay, maybe we should just take a look at this and just see how it unrolls, because the possibility is future employment opportunities for poor people in that area. Also, the nature and type of housing, whether it be for sale buyers or rent, could be some possibilities for for people having the opportunity to own some property like their house or their unit so they can pass that on to their kids so they don't permanently stay in the underclass. And then also, last but not least, an opportunity for subcontractors who have been systematically eliminated from the process, who are now being engaged by city council to participate in the process, to get some business opportunity so they can expand the companies. And then we actually have some graduates who come out of these programs so that there is folks who can now compete on the same playing field as the big folks, as the big guys. So it has a lot of good things that can happen. So we want to fall on the side of the possibilities of the good. And see what happens with a watchful eye. By City Council on seeing how this whole thing gets to be unraveled. Because truth is, I was raised at 3637 JACKSON When our family moved out the first place. I know the area. I grew up there. We used to go over there and shoot pigeons and whatnot at the bridge. I'm sorry, Chairman City, but your time's up. Thank you. I'm. All right, that concludes our speakers. Are there any questions from members of council? Councilman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. Pro tem. I wanted to ask Mr. Sella if you could come forward. I couldn't tell from the photos what type of industrial business was there and whether or not there will be a lot of environmental cleanup costs on the site. Can you just talk about that a little bit? The building that exists, there's that 9000 some square foot building. Right now, we're using it as a mill workshop. We build custom. We do a lot of restaurants and bars. We do a lot of historic work. So that's what it's being used for. So it's not a. Environmentally, it's pretty good. Have you had it for a very long time? We've had the that building since about oh five, I think it is. Okay. He used to be Colorado roping wire and rope. Okay. Before us. More related to the. The geographics of the neighborhood, huh? Will that the lot next door? My father bought back in the sixties. So that's how long we've had that lot. Okay. Yeah. All right. Thank you. I have no other questions. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilman Espinosa. Yeah. The what is the how much residential commercial? I mean, how much residential is currently allowed in the fire zone district? None. So that's a great question. The the eyes on district does not currently allow the establishment of new. Residential does allow existing and. But the CMU ten does correct. See the CMU ten does allow residential. That is correct. And what's the number of story, maximum number of stories that you can do in the eye and the CMU ten. Both are far based. So it would it would be a function of space and parking requirements, that sort of thing. Do they have impervious area requirements, the existing zoning? I do not know. Off the off the top of my head. Would you say, would you consider this concert? I mean, is there any change in development right now? Is this a net increase in development rights neutral or decrease in development rights? I don't know that I can I can really accurately answer that. You know, this results in the taking away of some heavier industrial uses and the addition of some new standalone commercial uses and new residential uses. But the establishment of some very high design guidelines, street frontage requirements, active use requirements, that sort of thing. So it's a trade off in both ways. Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Councilman. Councilman Flynn? Yes. Could you stay stay up there, please. Thanks. The CMU ten is an old Chapter 59 called. And so this wasn't updated in 2010, apparently because it had the waivers attached to it, is that. Absolutely. That is correct. Okay. So I just wanted to follow up on Councilman Espinosa's line of questioning. What what would be the density under the CMU ten? And yet, I guess what I heard you say was you couldn't really tell. Generally speaking, it would be about the same. But we would have to. It would it would be a, you know, a an equation based on the lot size and that sort of thing and proximity to other types of uses. Okay. And finally, you mentioned Monroe coming through to from 41st to 40th. Is that part of this rezoning or have we talked to the property owner? And will we be get will we. Be deeded the right of way for 44 of Monroe to come out to 40th? That's a great question, actually. It's my understanding and we did work talk with public works as a part of this rezoning application. They did review the application. The New Right of way will actually exist where about half of the current market lead trash and some other city right of way is they are requesting some access easements to the property during the construction and during the fill of the trench. But there is not a need for actual property here. Okay. And we are filling the trench. That's my understanding of the current plan. So I think right now Pier is. Being used as a dump. Right? Right. Okay. That's all. Mr. President. Pro Tem. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Seeing no other questions. The public hearing for Council Bill 288 is closed. Are there any comments from members of council? Guzman Espinosa. Yeah. You know, obviously, this this rezoning is consistent with the with the established criteria. That said, there are other aspirations that have come to light that have been voiced and codified in in adopted plans as well with speak to sort of how we'd want to use Tod and station area and, and the like. And so I mentioned this at Ludy in a different rezoning, but this one is the exact analogy. I met with the director of Public Works, Brad Buchanan, earlier today about this very situation where you have a industrial land and you rezone it to CMCs five or even higher in some cases, as we've done in other station areas , and doing it in a way where we would where we would establish we would we would adopt the the plan recommendations legislatively. But in grant this is a use by right. What is being sought here but with an affordability component. And in this was a this is a different approach than anything we've done. We've attempted before. But I think it gets to a sort of difficult to reach goal that that gets vocalized time and time again. So I will continue to be working on that so that we have the confidence as we as we capture some of these some of these things that this zone district does capture with regard to a change in use, introduction of housing, possible mixed use, maybe some design guidelines and standards or all the other things that are being discussed around this rezoning so that we can actually move forward with more confidence that these these new developments would actually be a little more comprehensive in in the demographics and opportunities that are captured that were spoken here at public comment in previous hearings. So, you know, but that's a function of what tools we have currently. We don't have tools in this project. This proposal matches the existing tools, but I look forward to hopefully one day bringing forward a different tool that we should all we could all be considering in this case. With that, I'll be voting in favor of this rezoning things. Thank you, Councilman. See no other comments. I'll just add that based on what was put forward in the public hearing in the staff report, I believe all the criteria have been met and I will be voting yes tonight. Madam Secretary, roll call.

The Committee recommended the full council pass as amended the Council bill with a divided report with Councilman Mr. Brian Johnson. So want and what is in favor. And councilmembers Herbold and Burgess opposed. Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. So, I mean, just give a quick overview of the legislation before us. We've had a lot of discussion on this, but I believe there's still four amendments that will be presented today. So we'll walk through those and make sure everyone has any questions addressed or concerns addressed to this legislation. Council Bill 118618 would lift the proviso that the Council placed on the money during last year's budget. As a reminder to folks in the 2016 budget, which we worked on during 2015, the mayor had originally proposed investing $5 million in expanding the bike share system that was part of a program that was going to be matched with a federal grant the application was in during the budget process. We heard back from the federal agency that that ground was not going to be awarded. And what the council did at that point was put a proviso on the $5 million, essentially saying this money stays in the budget, but it cannot be spent until you come back to council. And what we said at the time was we wanted to hear what an expansion plan for expanding a bike share system in Seattle looked like. What happened in the interim is we learned that the nonprofit Pronto, that runs the city's bike share system that was established to run this was no longer going to be solvent before the end of this month March. And so the mayor came back with this piece of legislation asking us to do a partial lift to the proviso essentially allowing him to spend the city to spend up to $1.4 million of that $5 million. And that is the legislation that's before us today. The expectation at this point is if we are to move forward, that request for proposals would be sent out in the next month or so, and we would hear back sometime this summer on what possible expansion options are available. At which point the Council would have a chance to review those and decide if we wanted to lift the proviso on the remaining $3.6 million and move forward for an expansion, which would likely happen sometime in the spring of 2017. There are well, there are a number of amendments that are listed. I believe that there are four that are going to be proposed today. And I propose going in order on our agenda is amendment number four, which was proposed by Councilmembers Burgess and Herbold to go first on that. Okay. Councilmember Burgess, thank you very much. Well, a bike sharing program, as I think all of us on the council have stated in the past, is an important and even a desired element of our public transportation network. We're faced with the reality today that the current system is insolvent and lacks the ridership, annual membership or revenue to be financially viable. In essence, the Council is being asked to invest in pronto rescue from insolvency so that a better and more financially viable service can be adopted. This is what economists call optimism bias. Despite the passionate advocacy by some in favor of this rescue, the risks of investing without a specific plan of action in hand. And we have no plan or a clear understanding of the city's financial exposure and an identification of what that exposure would be are exceedingly high. Such a rescue does not reflect, in my view, the level of care that the Council should exhibit as it exercises its fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers of Seattle. The other element that we have to consider here goes more to our process and procedures. And as the Council's budget chair, I think it's my duty to point this out. Asked first learned of Toronto's financial problems in early 2015, as is reflected in the city's application for a federal Tiger grant, which was denied. The Council should have been immediately informed of this material fact, and we were not. In December of last year, one month after the Council had imposed a budget restriction in November. As time went ahead and spent $305,000 to cover pronto operations for the month of December, January and February, violating the spirit and the intent of the Council's budget proviso. I don't think the Council should ignore that kind of behavior. So based on these facts and because of the financial risk to the city, I move amendment number four, which would allow repayment of the federal grant if necessary. While maintaining excuse me, while maintaining the proviso on the remaining funds. This approach would substantially reduce the financial risk to the city and allow us to develop a public private partnership with the clear expectation that no city funding would be required for future operating revenue and that the public and private parties would appropriately share responsibility for capital expenses. I believe that is a much more prudent and wise course for us to follow. So I would move. Amendment number. Four. Has been moved in Second Amendment four as stated by Councilmember Burgess. Are there any other responses to his amendment? I'd like to speak to you. Like to supporting comment. Councilmember Herbold I'd just like to clarify some changes that were made between the committee meeting that we had where I had an amendment that was a purely it denied the proviso, but it was a supported a purely private system. Councilman Burgess made some changes that put some brackets that I thought were appropriate as relates to the city funding specified that we were minimizing this. The the program that we would like to see come forward would minimize the city investment and would recognize that potentially the full $3.6 million in funds may not be needed. And if so, they should be reprogramed into other bicycle and pedestrian safety projects. I also wanted to just underscore really the primary difference between the bills before us today are really whether or not we're just paying off Toronto's debt, we're purchasing equipment that we'll likely not keep if we want a system that's flexible, like Port Portland's coming system, which is more like a bike version of a car to go where you can leave the bike and other places don't have to return it to the sort of the the docking systems that we have for the bikes now under the pronto system. And really, for me, the question is, is do we need to pay off Toronto's debt and purchase a bunch of equipment that we likely won't want to keep in order to issue an RFP that says what we do want? It's sort of like buying a flip phone, a flip phone and paying off the flip phone company's debt in order to bid on a smart phone. Why not just go for the smart phone? This is an evolving technology, and I really think that we need to understand that when prioritizing our public resources and that so that we aren't paying for the experiment, we're paying for the 2.0 version. So that's mostly what I had to add. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. I appreciate the comments that councilmembers Burgess and Herbold brought up. I'm going to oppose this amendment. I agree with the concerns about the timing and notification of our start throughout this past six or eight months in the work. And I struggle with the same question that Councilmember Burgess identified. What do we do when a department has not lived up to our expectations? And I I've struggled with that. In the end, what I know is there are thousands of people that are members of Bikeshare and use it on a daily basis and to take away a system that is working for those folks because a start has not lived up to our expectation, I don't think is the right step forward. Rather, I believe that we've made it clear that our state needs to do a better job on this and other communications and decision making. And through amendment that was passed, the committee made it clear that the Council will play an active role in scoping the RFP and reviewing it going forward. And there's an amendment I will bring forward later to further add language to that. I believe, as I think others do, that bike share is, can be and will be an integral part of our transportation network going forward. I view it as a type of public transit that helps connect users in different ways to get around the city. I think we are at a technology and flux point and we need to learn what goes forward. But I think the best path forward at this point is to make the modest investment, at least the marginal investment, because of the grant we would have to repay if we didn't go forward to maintain the existing system, to maintain our existing users and ridership. Looking at the data from last year, the the system, according to last year's operations, which were not great, still is only $100,000 away from breaking even. And my expectations are that as and the manage the folks managing the system can boost the performance this year to make it. An actual breakeven or hopefully even a profitable operation in 2016. And it can bridge to whatever expansion looks like. And there's a real reality that the expansion in 2017 may be with similar technology as we have today. That's a technology that's very similar to what we've seen in most cities around the country. It may be that there are new technologies that come forward in a more beneficial we could learn about in the fall. That said, I appreciate the work that folks have done on this, but I think this point I will say no on this amendment and instead move to fund the buyout. Can I just. To Councilmember Beck. Show. Thank you. I have just a quick clarifying question. Councilmember Herbold, I really appreciate what you are bringing forward and especially what we can learn from the mistakes or perhaps the not fully baked plan. And I'm wondering, Councilmember O'Brien, if you can talk a little bit further about your amendment that we're going to be seeing in a few moments. How can we incorporate the essence of what Councilmember Herbold is saying in terms of expanding a program that's going to work for Seattle? So. I believe what Councilmember Herbold talked about was there's different types of systems. Portland is about to roll out a different version. It's it's new technology. We haven't really seen it on the ground at the scales. Portland are going to do going to use it. And it may be that six months from now when we get responses to the RFP that there are vendors of that type of system that want to invest in Seattle and can put forward a plan that fits within our financial constraints and is competitive. We don't know that, though, and we're not going to know that for months. The amendment number nine, which I'll speak to in a moment, highlights the fact that we are looking for ideas on how to expand the existing system with the existing technology, a system that uses electric assist bikes instead, or perhaps a hybrid of that, or a point to point bikeshare system similar to what Portland is deploying. But it leaves the door open for folks to come forward with all the offers and allow us as a city to evaluate the pros and cons and cost of all those at that time. Could we have in front of US Amendment number four proposed by Councilmember Burgess and seconded by Councilmember Herbold? There's an even further discussion before I take a vote. I just have a quick question. Councilmember Gonzales. We've heard in the hundreds of emails that I think we've it's fair to say that we've all received on this issue on both sides of the question here. One of the things that gets highlighted is this issue around limited resources. And my understanding of how this money can be used is that, yes, we do have we do have we are a city of limited financial resources. But but your amendment amendment number four and doesn't permit repurposing of those dollars. Is that is that accurate? Amendment. Number four does not originally repurpose the dollars. It keeps them subject to the proviso if provisos are followed. I might add, unless the public private partnership is not established by the end of 2016, then the funds are released to start for pedestrian and bicycle safety improvement projects. If the full amount is not met. And if the full amount is not needed, they would go to that purpose. So these are street use funds. So they will unless the council were to take some different action, they will always be used for street pedestrian, bicycle, vehicle safety improvement type measures. And further to note, there is no use. To just be recognized. Councilmember Heard, what was that conversation with Councilmember Herbold? Correct. Thank you. There are also no limits to the number of federal and state dollars that could go into a public private partnership bike share program. Under amendment number. Four. Any further questions? Council Member Alice. I do not. Thank you. Okay. I think we're ready for a vote. So it's been, um, amendment four has been moved. And second, and all those in favor of the amendment please signify by saying I and raising your hand I. All those opposed signatures saying no one raising your hand? Nope. Okay. So the amendment fails. Are there any other amendments? Yes, Councilmember O'Brien. So I would propose in my paperwork right here. Amendment number five. I'll speak to it and then move it. This amendment would modify section two of the bill. That section already states that the Senate, the Council states its intent to grant authority to lift the proviso on the remaining $3.6 million only after Scott provides a detailed spending and implementation plan. This amendment would add language that adds to that condition that we would lift. The proviso on the expansion after our start also demonstrates that the following bicycle infrastructure projects are on schedule to be completed before sorry, prior to an expansion of the bike share system. And then it lists five protected bike lane projects, one of which is already under construction, and the other four which have been completed design and are in the pipeline ready to go. My understanding is these would need to be completed within the next year. And in conversations with our start, they believe that they can achieve that. So I would move amendment number five. It's been moved and Second Amendment number five, it moved in second. And any further comments or questions? Okay. Hearing then all those in favor of amendment number five. Please signify with saying I and raising your hand. I opposed. The ayes have it. Next amendment. Councilmember O'Brien. So to stick with going in order of the ones that I think are coming forward, I'm actually defer to Councilmember Gonzalez and I believe amendment number seven. Sure. I think you have an amendment number six. But if you want to do six or nine together, I'm happy I'm. Not going to bring six forward and bring nine forward instead, which incorporates the former six. Councilmember Johnson. So Councilmember six is put away and Councilmember Gonzalez will address number seven. Correct? Okay. Thank you. I am proposing amendment number seven, the council bill 118618 as amended. This this amendment has would revise two existing sections and would add a new section, section six revised section one would provide that the Seattle Department of Transportation would be required to use up to $50,000 of the proviso money for outreach activities, as described in Section six of my proposed amendment, which would require the Seattle Department of Transportation Section six new Section six would be entitled Engage Low Income Populations and Communities of Color. Consult with Seattle Office for Civil Rights Section. The new proposed Section six would require the Seattle Department of Transportation to engage low income populations and communities of color on the need for an expansion of the bike share system to serve those communities, as is instructed to do so in consultation with the Office for Civil Rights, which would be consistent with our city's commitment to the racial equity toolkit in the course of their development of an outreach plan that will be both linguistically appropriate and culturally competent and will include surveys and direct public engagement. It also authorizes Scott to engage community based organizations to assist in those community outreach aspects that relate to low income populations and communities of color and imposes a requirement on that to report those findings to council as required by SNC 5.09.040 no later than September 30th, 2016. A Section two simply modifies the number of the proviso from 3.6 to 3550000 to recognize the need to allocate with an existing proviso money. The $50,000 allocated in my amendment for purposes of doing this outreach activity and this particular piece is incredibly important to me. I discussed it in the council briefing this morning at 930. And essentially, I think what we hear a lot from from advocates in this particular area is that this would were this type of publicly funded bike share program would assist low income communities and communities of color. But I have not seen any data or study or analysis that supports that particular claim. And if we are going to move forward with a publicly funded bike share program, I think it is our obligation to engage those impacted communities, to set up a bike share program that clearly identifies the needs of those communities, and that sets up a bike share program that takes into account the multiple barriers to being able to access effectively and meaningfully a bike share program. So this this is the intent behind my particular amendment. And I also intend for it to apply citywide for all low income communities and communities of color that that may live in any area within the city of Seattle and not just restricted to one particular district. So with that being said, I'm happy to answer any questions, but would also entertain a second to this amendment. Okay. Okay. It's been moved in. Second Amendment number seven has been moved in second by our colleagues. Are there any further questions? I have Councilmember O'Brien. I want to thank Councilmember Gonzales for this amendment. I fully support it. And I think she spoke well to the concerns that we need to address going forward. I fundamentally believe that bikeshare system, as I mentioned before, is can be a successful, integral part of our public transit operation in the city. And to do that, it needs to work for all folks in Seattle. And I specifically appreciate you identifying not just in certain neighborhoods. Well, the bike system will most likely be located in starting in certain neighborhoods. And the idea is that folks are coming into the city or from other parts of the city using transit can get off transit and use the bike share for that last connection to their job. And so even though the stations may not be located in your neighborhood, they can really add to the mobility folks have. It's critically important that we understand the unique needs of different individuals in the community. Things like folks may not have credit cards, which can be a barrier to accessing the system in addition to just the cost of it. The training that's needed to make sure you understand how the system works, the location, the the rate schedule, all those things I think are appropriate for us to be looking at and modifying, if necessary, to make sure we have a system that works for everyone. So I will support this and thank you, Councilmember Gonzalez. Councilmember Suarez. Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank Councilmember Gonzalez and O'Brien. They we discussed some of the changes that we'd like to see going forward. I also want to correct myself this morning. I said that there were no stations north of the ship canal and I was wrong. There are no stations in District five. There is in the University District. But I want to go back to and just reiterate for some of you who weren't here this morning that I shared that in the contract with Pronto and Motivate. One of the issues is because we did accept federal dollars, we have to comply with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. And in that, it's really important. And I want to follow up on what Councilmember Gonzalez said. Is that not first of all, not everybody can ride a bike, but there's our communities where they have been overlooked and underserved. And of course, I'm speaking to some neighborhoods in the north. I'm concerned that there are neighborhoods that we are not going to see the kind of geographical diversity that we would like to see in a true bike sharing plan that is equity, that is equitable. I want to commend the former council for moving forward with this. Seattle is a bike city and so I want to look forward in that this new hopefully if we pass this will the city council will have more control with the RFP, with operations, with implementation, with expansion. And so some of us new council people get an opportunity to, if you will, have a second bite at the apple to make this a better program, to be more inclusive and to look at neighborhoods that haven't been served. And so with that, I want to thank the former council and some of the council members here today that brought forward these changes. And so we could also look at them through a social injustice lens. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman. Worse comes from infectious. You get hunched up. Thinking. Something back shot. Thank you very much, sir. I also want to recognize and thank people that have been working on this, including many who are in the audience. Seattle Neighborhood Greenways, for example, has been reaching out to every neighborhood, both on pedestrian and bicycle connections to make sure that we're a city where everybody can get around. And I'd also like to focus on the idea of all ages and abilities. It isn't simply that various neighborhoods or particular ethnic groups may have been left out. We really want to make sure that people like me, who's currently and riding an e-bike, that we're able to get around and that we feel safe as well. And this is where I also want to thank the Seattle Bicycle Advisory Board. Thank you, Kristie, for being here and speaking to that. I do see that as we are supporting and developing this bike share program. We're not there yet. We all know that. But we have a start and a foundation on which we can build. And it's part of this growing an integrated transportation system in every neighborhood for every age and ability. So thank you and I'll be supporting this. Okay. So I think that exhausts our comments on the amendment number seven. And is there any further comments, all those in favor of amendment number seven, vote I and raise your hand. I opposed the ayes have it. Are there any further amendments? I believe there's one last amendment. Councilmember O'Brien. I would like to move amendment number nine. You shouldn't have this paper in front of you. This would revise Section four. It currently reads that it will incorporate feedback from the Council in developing the request for proposals for expansion for the bike share system. This amendment would add language that says including the possibility of a combined free floating and point to point model deployment of electric bikes and expanding the existing system. It is the Council's intention that the Mayor engage the Council in the selection of the future bike share operator for the bike share RFP prior to any council action to lift the proviso on the remaining 3.4 million. But it should now read 3.55 million for expansion. And then it strikes the last part that was previously, which also referred to council working with the mayor. Second Amendment number nine has been moved in seconds. Are there any further comments or questions? Let me just speak to the two things that this one does, just so the public can track what I just read there. The first is it just highlights, as we talked about earlier, three different models that we may use an expansion, the existing model, an e-bike or electric assist bike model or a point to point. It doesn't restrict any proposals to those three, but those are the three that have been identified to this point. It also makes tries to clarify that the ultimate decision on who will be operating a bike share system under expansion is a decision to be made by the mayor in consultation with the council. And the council, of course, has ultimate authority to lift that proviso. So nothing will be done until it comes to a vote of us. But we're trying to stake out that we want to be working collaboratively, and this decision is a decision made at the elected level. Councilmember, I may ask you a question in recent. Articles in news reports. There have been at least concerns or allegations about conflicts of interest between department officials and how the city has gone about evaluating the Pronto arrangement. You know, there's been a few articles there. Does this. Amendment in any way sort of address some of those concerns, at least given some of the allegations made. In the comments and believe have been in the press have been related to the director of Hastert's previous employment with the company that this predecessor operated and continues to operate the the bikeshare system. But this is trying to make clear is that the decision of selecting for that RFP going forward, which may include people that bid from that company, is not a decision at the discretion of the stock director. Rather, it's going to be a decision made by the mayor in consultation with the council. So it is an attempt to address those concerns. Thank you very much. Are there any other questions on amendment number nine before we take a vote? I just have a clarifying because I'm changing that number from 3.4 to 3.55 to reflect the math. Is that something that we can do or do I need to change rules? Okay. So we'll get that back. Okay. So I think we're ready to vote. Amendment number nine has been moved. And second and all those in favor vote i. I. Opposed. Vote no. The ayes have it. Does that conclude all of our amendments? I think we're ready to vote on the base legislation. I have to move that. You know, it doesn't have to be actually move because it's already it went through committee so we could vote on it. Before I do ask for a vote, are there any further closing comments on the Bass legislation as amended? When I have a single Council member back, Southern Council member Johnson. Great. Just one quick one. And that is that I know over the last few weeks there's been a tremendous amount of heat around this particular legislation. Councilmember Gonzales brought it up. We have received hundreds of emails from people, both pro and con. And what I really hope we can do is rather than having just the heat to provide the light on the issues and the questions on why we want this, why we're moving forward, and I do really want to reduce the angst between drivers and pedestrians and people who are driving trucks or busses. There's this is an opportunity for us to really integrate our system both downtown and across the city. And I think our center city mobility plan that's going to promote a real integrated and yet separated bike lanes and better pedestrian connection so everybody can get around in our city, whether they're driving, whether they're driving a truck or driving a bus. For those that are taking them, this is needed. And to have a bikeshare program that works is something that will just contribute to our transportation system. So I appreciate this. I appreciate the support that my colleagues have given. I recognize what Councilmember Herbold and Councilmember Burgess were doing to make sure that this is an effective and efficient system. And I look forward to working with Scott to make sure that we've achieved what all we were speaking about today. So I'll be voting yes. Councilmember Johnson. You know, I, too, want to echo what Councilmember Baxter said. I'll be voting yes today. I fundamentally believe that with public support, I think bike share is going to expand, increase membership and really continue to be an integral part of our city's transportation network. I want to point out, in contrast to my colleague about optimism bias that we as a society spend a lot of time and energy subsidizing our transportation network. We bail out the auto industry. We bail out the airline industry. We bail out all kinds of different private entities in the in the transportation space. We make significant investments in our public transit infrastructure because we see transportation as a critically important part of the public good. And so for me, I think that this is a modest investment to allow us to really move forward on a system that we know is going to work well for people. And I really want to say how much I welcome the opportunity for us to really move forward on a stronger protected bike network. I think that that has got to be really hand in glove with the investment that we're making today, as well as the potential expansion. I fundamentally believe that a bike lane is only a bike lane when it's safe enough for an eight year old to ride in it. And that means that when I think about the vision for the future of our city, it's a place where my little five year old daughters can learn how to ride a bike, not just in the on the ports in our backyard, but also safely on our city streets and a place that they feel safe and that I feel safe. I think that Pronto is going to be very successful system once we have the opportunity to expand that system. And I encourage my colleagues to vote yesterday. I wanted to thank Councilmember Burgess and Council Member Herbold for bringing the issues you did raise that. We need that kind of in this case, minority opinion, but this kind of opinion to make sure we're making wise investments and that it goes through the kind of scrutiny that you require the council to go through. And even though we opted to go a different direction, I think it was a very exhaustive discussion. And I want to thank you for both your committee discussion, your amendments and the discussion today. Having said that, please call the roll on the passage of the bill as amended. Gonzalez, I. Herbold Ney Johnson, I. Or is. Yeah. I'm sorry. Yes. Thank you. O'BRIEN All right. Frances Bagshaw, I. Burgess No. President Harrell I seven in favor to oppose.

Present your summary strictly in formal legislative format demonstrated in the examples, ensuring clarity, brevity, and accuracy of details.",14,"Agenda item to council bill 119788 an ordinance relating to residential rental agreements allowing residential tenants to pay rent in installments when the tenant is unable to timely pay rent. Declaring an emergency and establishing an immediate effective date all by a vote of the City Council. I thank you, Madam Clerk. I will move to pass Council Bill 119788. Is there a second? Second. It's been moved in, seconded to pass the bill. This is a bill that I have sponsored, and so I'm going to make a few comments about it in advance, and then I'll go ahead and open it up or ask for additional comment. So, colleagues, today we have this bill before us to ensure more flexibility and time for more households that may need to stay housed. That will definitely need to stay housed as we enter week 11 of this public health emergency. We know that many of our constituents have found themselves laid off, furloughed or with a loss of income and are still waiting for unemployment benefits to cover household expenses. And we are still waiting for other forms of relief and aid such as the CARES Act, to provide cash and rental assistance to tenants and small landlords. This bill will enable more households to enter into payments with their landlords. And I want to take a moment to acknowledge that the landlords who already have this practice in place with their tenants, it is considered the industry's best practice and many good landlords are engaging in that behavior. But there are many that are not. So this best practice, again, is to voluntarily enter into these payment plans. We want to ensure that the greatest number of tenants have access to the this best practice and that this legislation ultimately will mandate that they participate in that best practice. Additionally, this bill would prohibit late fees, interest or other charges that are associated with late payment of rent. This would apply throughout the course of a civil emergency and for six months after the mayor declares the public health crisis to be over. Governor Inslee's extended and expanded evictions order contains similar protection around late fees, and I believe this bill complements protections for renters in the governors and mayors moratoriums. I want to thank the Seattle Department of Construction Inspection, the King County Bar Association's Housing Justice Project, Washington Pan and the Washington Multifamily Housing Association, which represents landlords and other property owners for their feedback and insights in the development of this legislation. For something that is very straightforward, simple, and will allow tenants the flexibility they need to stay in their homes in the event that they fall behind on the rent. This is a common sense solution to just create a pathway for tenants and landlords to come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial to both of them, that will promote housing stability, and that will ultimately create an opportunity for people to stay in place for as long as possible. I was pleased that when I had an opportunity to talk to the governor's office about this legislation, that they implemented a similar effort statewide. And I think that it is important for us to now follow up on on that particular route and do the same right here in the city of Seattle. So I would appreciate your all support of this particular bill. I just think it's so important and creates sort of a really rich ecosystem for for renters who are really seeking a little bit more time and a lot more assistance to be able to stay housed. So with that being said, I'm happy to open it up to colleagues if there are any comments on the bill. Councilmember Herbold, followed by Councilmember Peterson. Thank you. I want to thank Council President Gonzales for putting this forward. I want to thank her as well for her collaboration in developing this legislation, collaboration that led to some unfortunate delays. But I appreciate your doing so. The sum of some of the changes in this new version relate specifically to modify the reason for which tenants can use the payment plan that required a title change and a requirement to re reintroduce it. And this was really important because it would be very difficult to ask a judge to make a determination whether or not a nonpayment of rent eviction is the result of of COVID 19. And so making this change in the ordinance lifts that barrier. For for the courts. And and helps tenants in doing so. But again, that required the patience of the bill's sponsor in order to do so. And as as our council president is always very patient with us. Again, much appreciated. So I want to thank her for other elements that were included in the substitute. Specifically related to. Late fees and attorney's fees and court costs. That is very, very helpful. And I just want to underscore some of the comments that the sponsor already made related to this just being a common sense path between an eviction moratorium where people don't have anything to do with their their short on rent but not pay rent and and paying the full rent. When the mayor. Proposed. Her eviction moratorium in the FAA queue, the frequently answered questions. One of the one of the pieces of guidance for for tenants when they when they don't have enough money to pay is to encourage tenants to work on developing a payment plan for partial payments in order to reduce the amount of money owed at the end of the moratorium. This puts into into ordinance, into policy, a way to do that. And again, I think it's just a really common sense approach expert expressing our expectations that landlords should accept partial payments because it's good both for landlords and it's good for tenants as well. So thanks again. Thank you so much, Councilman, for really have appreciated your partnership on this bill as well and and have appreciated benefiting from your experience in this space. So thank you so much. Okay. Next up is Councilmember Peterson. Thank you, council president. And thank you to your staff and to the council, central staff for their hard work on this bill. We had plenty of notice to think about this one. So we appreciate that. Did have some concerns and questions. The just want to confirm for the record that if there is a rental agreement or a payment plan in effect between a tenant and a landlord, that's. Fully executed already. Would this legislation preempt that or supersede that or with it still be in place? The the it does isn't designed to preempt anything. It would sort of provide a minimal flaw. So if the existing agreement between the landlord and tenant is stricter or harsher, for example, than than what the ordinance or I should say, not as beneficial to the tenant as the ordinance, then the ordinance would come into into effect. Oh. Okay. All right, that's. I did not know that. I thought that if there was a written agreement already in place, that this would not supersede it. But it sounds like it would, that it's not as beneficial for the tenant. So according to council central staff, it would not again, it does not preempt existing agreements. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And just wanted to better understand. I know I know in my remarks for the previous bill, my concern is that we don't know when the mayor's emergency declaration will end. Your your previous bill was six months after the eviction moratorium, whereas this is six months after the emergency declaration. And since that may go on for a long period of time, I just I didn't know would help for the. Public. And for me to understand why that different starting point in the legislation. Well, I think I think it's just it's just as you mentioned, it's sort of these things are not done with precision. And it's a little unclear to us when exactly the moratorium is going to end. I acknowledge that that creates some uncertainty. But the reality is, is that the financial crisis or the, you know, opportunity to enter into a mutually beneficial rental agreement is, I think, a valid policy priority regardless of of the timing. So, again, you know, I think originally we thought about, you know, sort of starting that point somewhere else. But I think at this juncture makes most sense to allow the greatest possible period of time for landlords and tenants to enter into a mutually beneficial agreement, to allow for landlords to get their rent and for renters to pay their rent and avoid eviction. So again, as Councilmember Herbold so artfully described, this is really about middle ground area. So we have extremes in the landlord tenant law. Right now, we have one extreme is eviction. You lose your housing. The other option is don't pay your rent. And we're trying to create a pathway forward here in the middle that says, look, we want to for those landlords and tenants who agree that that rent needs to be paid. And I believe that the vast majority of folks, we need to be able to create an opportunity for them to come up with a pathway to do so. And so this codifies that intent and that opportunity for landlords and tenants to agree with each other about what that rental repayment plan is going to look like. Thank you. He and colleagues. Any other questions or comments? Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and close out debate. I really do appreciate the ongoing attention in this area. And again, when I said this during council briefing, but I want to say it again now, I really want to thank Asha from council central staff and from my office for being stellar on this policy issue and really working hard to make sure that as pieces were moving at the state related to the Governor's proclamation about our rental payment plan statewide and our version of the bill, that we weren't sort of running into areas of conflict potentially. Also, I really want to thank the executive for their support in moving in this direction as well, and have been grateful for their cooperation on understanding the enforcement issues that would be at play and looking forward to the mayor signing this into law pretty quickly, as has been indicated to me she will do. So with that being said, I am going to go ahead and ask that the clerk please call the role of pass. Please call the role in the passage of the bill strauss. I. Purple. Hi. Juarez. I. Lewis. Hi. Morale is. High. Macheda. I. Peterson. I. So aren't I? President Gonzalez, 39, in favor? None. Oppose. I think you so much colleagues really appreciate your support of that bill. The bill passes and the chair will sign it and it gives a fixed my signature to the legislation. I'm moving right along. We'll go to agenda item three. Will the clerk please read the short title of the bill? Even to the right? Agenda Item three Council Bill 119 785 relating to funding for housing and community development programs.

Yes, the way the proceeds from the sale of these two parcels will be dedicated to affordable housing.

No public comment. Please cast your votes. Just one person. Bush cares. We will do item 38 next, please. Item 30 Report from Economic Development Recommendation to adopt resolution declaring city owned property located at 854 East Seventh Street as exempt surplus land District one. Mayor John Casper has assured staff report on this item. Honorable Mayor and members of the city council. I'm going to introduce Mary Tours, who will walk us through what the Surplus Land Act requires for this property at 850 47th Street or the Armory. Mary. Thank you, Mayor. Members of the City Council. The Surplus Land Act is found in government code section 454220. The purpose is intended to prioritize re-use of surplus lands for affordable housing, parks and schools. It applies to all public land that is declared surplus. Notable amendments include expanding definition of local agencies to agencies not previously subject to the surplus land art. Clarifies this position to include leasing and not just sales, clarifies local agencies, does not include commercial or industrial uses, including non-governmental retail, entertainment or office development. No longer allows exceptions, but it does exempt expand exemptions available due to size, affordability and other characteristics. It requires city council action to declare a property a surplus or exempt for post prior to disposition requires written notice of availability to the State of California, Department of Housing and Community Development, as well as housing sponsors. Requires local agencies to submit their process to HCD for compliance verification. Allows exceed 30 days to respond to that submittal and gives the city a 60 day care period if its notice of a violation. It also imposes penalties if the property disposition is found in violation of authority and is not sure the product. The property before you is located at 850 47th Street. If the city gained ownership of this property through a deed reversion once the California Army National Guard ceased use of it as Long Beach Armory. The city did release a solicitation for a long term lease and selected Gundry partners to develop the property as 100% affordable housing development . Adaptive reuse of the armory building and improvements to combine park. Concurrent to our process, HCA and the state attorney general clarified that the facility does apply to leases. The city then paused negotiations with the developer until we could confirm the process that the SLA modified, as well as the exemption that was available to the project. Exemption available to the project in section five for 2 to 1 allows the property to be declared surplus if it meets certain requirements. One, not less than 80% of the building area will be used for housing. Number two, no less than 40% of the total number of units would be affordable to lower income households, and half of that 40% must be affordable to very low income. And three, a recorded regulatory agreement providing those minimum standards would run with the plan for 55 years. This project, the current building area, 72,710 square feet.

Report from Economic Development Recommendation to adopt specifications for the purchase and development opportunity at 5571 Orange Avenue. Declare the property as surplus and authorize city manager to execute all documents necessary with the Long Beach Community Investment Company for the sale of the property in the amount of 729,000 District eight. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I'd like to get a staff report on this, please. John Keisler. Honorable mayor and members of the city council. Thank you. Yes, this this property is the former North Library located East 56th in Orange. As you know, about two years ago, and with the opening of a michelle Obama library, this property was vacant and surplus. And we went to RFP a few months back and got a couple of great proposals for different concepts, ultimately selecting a residential project as the, the, the award for the property. This organization, of course, Long Beach Community Investment Company, is a separate nonprofit entity of the city. They they actually will be putting this project out to RFP for an affordable housing developer. We're likely to get six units of two story housing in the neighborhood surrounded by other residential lots. And so we expect this to happen the next phase of the project in 2019, likely when the ultimate buyer and developer is selected, they will go through the whole entitlement and design process with development services, and we hope to see a project about 24 to 36 months from now. I'm happy to answer any other questions and stand by. Thank you, Councilman Austin. So I'd like to just express my my support for this this this this item and this I think this is a a great reuse for the North Library. Originally, I thought that, you know, the North Library was the old North Library on Orange Avenue was a space where, you know, lots and lots of people benefited from from a public space. The make up of that corridor is mostly housing and transit oriented. And so to reuse and understanding that the tremendous housing need that we have, this makes a lot of sense. And so this will have my support, I think, in the interim, this the space will will be have some other uses, but we hope . And, Michael, my question to staff is how soon can can after this sale proceeds? How soon do you expect to to have construction? Actually, something actually happening on this location? We expect probably within the next 12 months, you may not see construction begin, but we certainly see potentially demolition of the site to clear the way for construction when the entitlements are given. And I know can you talk about some of the the interim uses for the particular site that we're talking about? Who's the city manager? Until the site is demolished, we're going to see it be utilized primarily for antic and adjunct uses by the health department. Currently. Right now, the North Health Facility at Horton Park has some HVAC issues and that's going to go through some construction. So the programs that are there now at Horton Park are going to trend. These are through the Health and Human Services Department will transition to that facility and utilize that throughout the next year. Well, again, the library has been vacant for for a couple of years now. And obviously, we have a great new library in the Michelle Obama library not too far away. I am happy that that the spaces is being used for for good public benefit, but also will be hopefully used in the very near future to to house families and individuals in need of housing. And so it has my support and ask for I ask for my colleagues support as well. Councilman Richardson. Supported. Any public comment? Seeing none. Please cast your vote on a roll call.

Item number 21. Communications from councilman all hour, Austin Vice Mayor Susan Lowenthal, Councilwoman Stacey Mango, Council Member Rex Richardson. Recommendation to request city manager to report back to City Council within 45 days on the measures that the city is taking to meet the new water conservation requirements and request the water department to provide a report on what additional measures the water department is implementing for residents and businesses. Councilman Austin. Thank you. And this is pretty straightforward. As we all know. On April 1st, Governor Brown issued an executive order mandating substantial reduction in water usage across the state. This came after the snowpack levels at the Sierra Nevada were measured at only 5% of normal levels. The governor required restrictions on local governments to achieve a 25% statewide reduction, and the State Water Resources Board is currently developing the regulations to implement these mandatory reductions because of Long Beach, previous and current significant conservation efforts. We're currently looking at a reduction requirement of 16% for the city of Long Beach. We all must do our part to help conserve water as the drought we are experiencing is likely to become more of the norm than the expectation in our state. I'd like to thank my colleagues for joining me in this request for the city manager to report back to the City Council within 45 days on what steps the city will be taking to achieve water reduction in water use in the city. And we'd also like to request the water department to share with the city council and the public what additional measures they may be implementing for residents and businesses throughout the city to help Long Beach do a fair share in meeting these new water conservation standards. And so, again, I'd like to thank my colleagues for for signing on to this very important issue. Obviously, we are facing a crisis here in the state of California. We've done some amazing work here in the city of Long Beach thus far, but we still have a lot of work to do. And I'm really interested in hearing more from from my colleagues and their thoughts, but more importantly, getting that report back after 45 days. I would encourage your support. Yeah. I also want to thank my colleagues for bringing this forward. I do want to say that I think Long Beach has already done a phenomenal job with water conservation and all the reports that I've read in terms of where Long Beach stands with this is is a phenomenal. So I'm looking for looking forward to a real positive report. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Mongo. I'm just so thrilled that the city of Long Beach has done such an excellent job with water conservation and look forward to sharing with the community what our district has been working hand-in-hand with the fire department to be able to do to ensure that we don't have sprinkler usage at any of our fire stations in the fifth . So more good, exciting conservation news to come. Okay. And I'd also like to add some comments. I'd like to thank Councilmember Austin for bringing this request forward and to keep the issue of water conservation and what Long Beach does in terms of water conservation, really at the forefront of not just our conversation here, but the minds of our residents as well. It's important to note that Long Beach Water Department has been at the forefront of water management in Southern California for decades, and it's something that we should be very proud of. Could we do more? We can always do more. But sitting on the Metropolitan Water District and really observing what everyone's experiences in this area with agencies throughout the six county region, I have to assure you and say to you that I'm very proud of how much Long Beach residents have conserved over these decades. I think currently we are at 114 gallons per capita per day. That's a pretty significant difference from 173 gallons per capita per day 30 years ago. So we've made a tremendous reduction over the last three decades, and that was before any mandates came into place. And if we could reference what another city's per capita use is, the city of Los Angeles is 123 gallons per day. And and every city has a different context. And so I don't make that comparison to disparage anyone else's efforts, but really just to demonstrate how much our residents have committed to conservation. So they're really the backbone of conservation efforts. And yet we consider all the front and backyard lawns in the city without water efficient timers or nozzles, or the fact that square footage of these lawns could be reduced or even eliminated with our lawn to garden program. So we do have a lot of options for people. Attractive options. I'm actually very optimistic that there's room for even more carp per capita reduction of water usage. And I have every bit of confidence that our residents will continue to make good choices to conserve water. And if I can reference back to Metropolitan last week, it was last week. Last Tuesday, we took a vote based on the governor's mandate, executive order on mandatory reduction for the for the entire state. The initial motion was for a 20% reduction that was made by board member director Judy Abdo from Santa monica and seconded by me . And while 20% sounds like it would be an onerous challenge to us in the city of Long Beach, it's something that we can do. Our residents can do that and demonstrate that. And sadly, that motion failed. And so there was a second motion for 15% reduction. And that did pass. And and certainly Long Beach voted yes. And I'm I'm still struggling to understand, but I will call the chairman of the Metropolitan Water District to find out why the chairman of the board voted no on both motions. So it's I looked at the vote record today. So we all represent different areas. Some areas have far more agricultural interests than certainly Long Beach does, and perhaps the challenge in reduction is greater. We understand that. And so I was a little startled by that vote. And I want to share with you that that's something I'd inquire about. But back to our issue in our city. I want to just make a comment about our city departments. I'm very pleased with the commitment in our operation side of the House and our use of recycled water in our golf courses and parks. But it would appear that we have a significant challenge and this is not a surprise to any of us here. We have a significant challenge ahead of us in replacing our park and median irrigation infrastructure. So City Manager West, you know this and I know that General Manager Water from the water department, you both will have thoughts about this, about our biggest areas and need for conservation. I don't know if you'd like to say anything part about that. It's something that we've discussed before. Vice mayor, council members, just to let you know that we're in. Very good. Communication with Mr. Wadia he has just done. If I have to echo what you've said, he's done a fantastic job in leading the city in water conservation, and he's at the front of the parade and we're following and talking to him. And we certainly are dealing with Mr. Wadia and the MWD on what potential grants and opportunities we have to eliminate turf get to zero escape. And I look forward to coming back in 45 days with all the when we know all the restrictions we're going to have to live with and then what we plan to do. And also have Mr. Wadia give us a talk about what's happening citywide. I appreciate that, and thank you for mentioning Mr. Waters. Leadership. I've known Kevin since 1997 and From Water when he had worked elsewhere. And I've met many general managers from throughout, not just Southern California, but really other states as well. And Kevin is a tremendous asset to this city. He's not only an expert in water, but he truly fights the good fight as as our city manager often uses that that expression, he does fight the good fight. And council members, I want to assure you and hope that you feel the same pride and hope we have an opportunity to talk with him. He really does do a phenomenal job on behalf of the city of Long Beach. We only have we have less than 2%, 2% of the vote on the Metropolitan Water District. But his voice is strong on our behalf and he's highly respected. And I'm very proud to work alongside him. Thank you. Councilmember Mungo. Since we are talking about water conservation, there's been a lot on the Internet recently about the program that Allen I discussed when I council member Austin and I discussed when I first got elected, and that we partnered on to work with the water department. There is a one year program where we are doing a pilot program where you can get artificial turf in your front yard right now. And so if you are interested in that program, please reach out to my office and we will help you through that process. Because while there continues to be information on the Internet about the standard program for lawn to garden at this time, if turf is the direction you'd like to go, which is artificial grass, and we do have a one year pilot program to see how that's working and how it works for our residents. So please reach out at 5705555. Thank you. Seeing for no further comment on the side of the diocese, is there any public comment? On this item. Very good. Quick as the address a student. Astute analysis of that of the item. Indicates that the central theme that over lines underlines and encompasses that. Is a very astute clarion call. The governor has sounded relative to the unprecedented drought. An unintended consequence is a second call. What that calls for is for the city to stop the near two and a half year, three year evisceration of the enhancement and support components of the Marine Stadium. Which is ocean fed. The pictures that the governor stands in front of have most and most people have seen them are the inland lakes of this state that are near bone dry. The Long Beach Marine Stadium is receiving the increased traffic for that. And that will continue to. There will be a direct correlation between the continuing drop in those levels and the people that will want to spend the weekends out on their boat. And they will come to this, which is certainly the premier venue for this in this section of California. They need. There needs to be the enhancement you cannot support. The venue. You can't take down all the support structures such as this to us. Such as? They want to take you down 8 hours and another one when you come down. Most people don't want their families to have to deal with porta potties. Period. So it's an unintended consequence of the campaign to eviscerate. Has to come to an end and you've got to start thinking like your counterparts did back in the late 30, in the late twenties. What type of enhancements can you do to take care of those people that will be coming in increasing numbers? And I believe the governor is absolutely correct. This drought is not going away. For the next 2 to 3 decades. That's in a way a blessing, because we can there are many people that will want to go to a destination point. With their family. And Watsky and the captain, Horatio Hornblower, and their vote for the day or for the weekend. We've got the primary venue. We need those to retain those original and upgrade them. Upgrade support components. Thank you. Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. Let's call for the vote. I mean. Yes. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Motion carries seven zero. Item number 25. Yes. I'm sorry, 23. Excuse me.

The public hearing for 903 is now open. Can we have the staff report, Karen? Good evening. Council Brooks Council members. My name is Karen. I'm a principal planner with Landmark Preservation at Community Planning and Development. And this is the Packard Hill Historic District application. In 1967, I Landmark Preservation was established within the city and county of Denver. Since that time, 336 individual landmarks have been designated and 52 historic districts, which represents about 4% of the city and county of Denver. For the process of designating applications or submitting designation applications. They can come from owners of properties. From the manager of Community Planning and development. Members of City Council. Or in this particular case, from residents within the historic district. This district application was submitted by 17 applicants within the proposed Packard's Hill Historic District boundary. For properties that are designated, they are designated as is. There are no requirements to improve a property or to restore it to particular time. The intent is to preserve the historic character of the neighborhood. The design review is required only for exterior changes to the building that requires building or zoning permits. It is not for general maintenance. We don't review paint colors. The building is not frozen in time, and so the design guidelines are intended to allow changes for properties within a historic district. Properties that are considered, considered contributing. It's highly discouraged for demolitions of those particular properties. Here's an example of some of the design guidelines pages that are within the adopted design guidelines. They address a wide range of topics, but deal with the preservation of the historic character. There are small things like fences and retaining walls, solar panels and sustainability. We do a large number of roofing reviews. We also do additions to buildings, new infill construction and secondary structures. Those are all addressed within the design guidelines. About 70% of the reviews that we do within Landmark Preservation are reviewed by landmark staff. Those particular design review applications are smaller in size and must meet the design guidelines per ordinance. Landmark staff reviewed about 1200 applications in 2016. Those are sort of divided into what we call quick reviews, which are typically one day reviews for replacement of roofing, a replacement of existing fences, replacing of AC units. The smaller projects that are administratively reviewed by landmark staff, typically within a 10 to 15 business day period are fences, garages, solar panels and smaller rear additions that meet the design guidelines. The other 30% of the projects that we review go before the Landmark Preservation Commission. They're larger additions in fills pop tops. The commission is made up of nine commissioners. Two are recommended by the American Institute of Architects. Two are recommended or one is recommended by the Landscape Architects. Two Recommended by Denver Planning Board. Two by History, Colorado. And two are at large. And these are just some recent design review items that have come before the Landmark Preservation Commission of Infill Construction. And they show a range of whether people tend to do something that is more historic in nature and more traditional, or if they do something more modern. And this the design guidelines really talk about infill construction or pop tops or additions to be compatible with the character of the neighborhood in sort of the massing, size and scale . So these are two recent projects that are in the most historic district that were recently approved. Here are two modern takes on an Italianate in the Curtis Park neighborhood. The one on the right is actually done all of shingles and the one on the left is all in brick. So they're very obviously new construction, but kind of feel feel like they fit fitting within the neighborhood. And so there's been just a lot of questions about what does compatibility look like. So I wanted to give you guys some examples of that. And then finally, here's one that's very modern. This is within the Wyman Historic District. And you can see what it looks like from the front. But this is a rear addition with the glass cube at the back. So changes can be made in a variety of different ways. And I know people have been talking a lot about design review, so I just wanted to give some sort of brief examples of things that have been recently approved. For this particular application. It was submitted by 17 community members who live or reside within the boundary of the proposed Packard Hill historic district. It is in Council District one and it is roughly bounded by Lowell Boulevard and the alley between Osceola and Perry Street and 32nd to 35th. It's a primarily residential neighborhood. The boundary is established by the applicants when they submit the designation application. It is within a area of stability within Blueprint Denver and it is mainly a single unit and two unit zoning. There's a little bit of you next to kind of down at the very bottom. So as this process has proceeded. Landmark Preservation Staff attended two public meetings that were held in January and February and March of this year. The application was then submitted a leader in the spring, early summer, we sent honor notification letters to all of the property owners as listed by the Assessor's record to everyone within the proposed boundary. We notified the registered neighborhood organizations as well as courtesy notifications, notified City Council Planning by planning, board and building inspections, posted signage prior to the Lpsc public hearing. After I had gone through both LPC and the Denver Planning Board, we sent out of another owner notification letter to everyone who was on the assessor records to notify all property owners within the boundary. So when we review a landmark designation application, whether in a district or an individual, it is looked at as the criteria established by the landmark ordinance, which is to main maintain the historic and physical integrity to meet one designation criteria and two or more of the following categories history, architecture and geography and relate to a historic context and theme. This is what is analyzed by landmark staff as well as by the Landmark Preservation Commission. For this particular desert district, there were 82% of the buildings were considered contributing. And so when I had mentioned earlier that contributing buildings, it was highly discouraged for those to be demolished. 82% of those are were determined to maintain the character of the historic neighborhood. So 82 were considered contributing within the historic district, which helps maintain its strong, historic and physical and integrity. Both landmark staff and the Landmark Preservation Commission found that the property or the district met the criteria for historic and physical integrity. I also found that it was a stat that it had met under history, under I'm sorry, history and architecture under two categories. So this is the how it meets it under history is having a direct association with the historical development of the city, state or nation. This shows two maps one a 1905 based map, which shows in pink the buildings that were built out at that time. And then a 2016 overview map. The blue line on the map shows where the historic trolley line was established at this neighborhood, was established initially as or hoped by the developers to be established as. A very high style for the wealthy for wealthy individuals. And there are a few homes that look like that. But in the end, it really ended up being a middle class neighborhood that was able to commute within to the city and county of Denver due to the trolley line. And so the establishment of the trolley line is really intricately linked with the development of this particular neighborhood. And this reflects nationwide trends of people sort of escaping the vice in the industry of of an urban core and moving out and in its place, actually literally moving up and away from the the pollution of Denver at that time. The area is also having direct association with Denver's women's history. The authors, as they researched this application, found that a high percentage of the women were active in the women's rights movements, in suffrage, in women's organizations and in temperance, which ties strongly to the development of this particular area. This was an area that had basically a prohibition against alcohol. And when the community was looking to be annexed into Denver, it was actually voted down by the women because they didn't want there to be drinking in the area. And in order for it to be annexed into Denver, it had to be allowed that there would be no alcohol served at in that area. There was also women who were highly developed in the real estate area and they were actively employed with buying and selling within the Packard Hill historic district as well as outside throughout Denver . So this has strong links to Denver's women's history. It also meets it under history criteria C for having direct and substantial association with a person or groups of persons who have influence on society. This is a short list of some of the people who are included in there. We have an early livestock raiser and mining investor, an artist who helped establish Denver's first art museum. I'm an acclaimed actress of the stage and screen in Spring Byington. Dr. Mary Ford was an early and long time female doctor in the area. We also have an early writer and reporter and temperance activist Bert Bosworth. And then there are two mayors, William Fitz, Randall Mills and Benjamin Stapleton. Stapleton is included because of his role in the development of Denver and his terms as mayor. And so his influence is noted within the application. But it also must be done while recognizing and documenting and examining his active role in the KKK as well. Architecture. It is also significant under architecture by embodying distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type. It is significant for its queen in an Edwardian architecture. And as you can see at the bottom, there's sort of the high style. And then at the top, you see some ones that are. A little less decorative. It is also known for its classic Cottages and Denver Squares, which were which developed as a way of a reaction against the high style of the Queen in architecture. There are bungalows as well. They turn out a little bit after the turn of the century. And then English and Norman Cottages and then terraced type buildings that are a significant as a way to bring you know, oftentimes one person would live in one side and they would have a A on the other side. And so the development and the architecture of this particular district is for shows sort of how Denver styles are applied, but really done in brick because Denver is so heavily is so often built out of brick. And so it shows the application of nationwide styles as applied to Denver and Denver's working class. And finally, it is significant for the work of a recognized architect and master builders. So the first is a noted Denver architect, William Quail Quilt. Most of Quill's work has been demolished, and so this is one of the few buildings that is left of his. It is also the residence of some of the important individuals within Denver or with within the Packard still historic district. And then on the right are David and Tilden. Cox they are a master stonemasons, a father and son. And so they ended up building two particular buildings. And this shows their workmanship, workmanship and craftsmanship. And they also lived within these. So it was basically an advertisement for their work. And so they are very noted stonemasons. So the landmark designation criteria ordinance requires that it also meets a historic context or theme. So it meets the context of late 19th century growth of the Highlands, the expansion of the tramway system that helped further development annexation into Denver, and then the continued growth of the area up through but tapering off at World War Two. The period of significance are the time period for when something is determined to be significant, reflects that that historic context and growth. And it was established as 1886 to 1940, which reflects the early development, the continued expansion in this slowdown due to World War Two. The Landmark Preservation Commission found that it met it under historic and physical integrity, that it made it under history, under criteria A and C, under architecture to A, its distinguishing characteristics of styles and types and significant examples of the work of recognized architect. The Landmark Preservation Unanimously decree recommended that be sent to City Council for your approval. It also went to planning board only districts. Go to the planning board for their review, and planning board has a very narrow scope. They consider a proposed designation with respect to its relationship to the comprehensive plan and the effect of the designation upon the surrounding neighborhood. Such other planning considerations as may be relevant if they if they feel there's something else that needs to be discussed. So this meets the comprehensive plan. The designation application is consistent with the plan recommendations. It reinforces the city and neighborhood character and respects and enhances the interest intrinsic, historic and cultural character. And they found that it met the comprehensive plan. This is a blueprint to Denver. It shows that this is primarily a single family residential area and it's concept plan use. The proposed district would help preserve the single family residential character. And historically, as the trolley line ran along 30 seconds and established a mixed use character. It's part of the neighborhood center, and so that would be helped retained by the historic designation. For Blueprint Denver. It is located within an area of stability. The guiding areas of stability are keeping valued community characteristics in older and stable neighborhoods and identifying and maintaining the character of an area while accommodating some new development and redo and new redevelopment. Historic designations in general help identify and help retain the character defining features of a district and provide stability. The Planning Board also looks at the effect on the surrounding neighborhoods. The purpose of this particular designation is to preserve the character defining features of this neighborhood. There would be little impact on the area around as landmark purview is only within the boundary of that particular historic designation on here. Anything in Brown is an established historic district, and in red are the individual Denver landmarks. The intent of this designation is to recognize the unique district and the buildings that define it. Planning Board recommended that this met the both the comprehensive plan and blueprint Denver and that it would have little effect on the surrounding neighborhood. They voted nine one to recommend approval of the proposed district. We received numerous public comments on this particular designation because so many of the public public comments that we were received came from the same individuals. CPD counted it as individuals who commented to us. So we received by the deadline that we submitted to Denver City Council on last Thursday, we had received letters or comments and or signature cards or petitions from 222 individuals. Of those, 187 were in support and 35 were in opposition at the Landmark Preservation Commission. There were 24 members of the public who spoke at that 14 were in support and ten in opposition and at planning board. Nine were in support of the designation application. So in summary, the Landmark Preservation Commission found that it met it under its required ordinances for historic and physical integrity. It met it under the designation criteria under history and architecture and under the theme and context. All right. Thank you. Kara, we are, um. Okay, we're. We're up to 90 speakers now after we've gone through the. Getting everybody loaded in. We just loaded up and said we have 90 speakers. And so everything I said before with the exclamation point. Okay, I'm going to call the first five speakers. You're going to come up to the front here and go right ahead and we're going to try to move expeditiously. The other thing that I'll tell you is please make sure you are letting us know your address. And it will be especially helpful if you let us know if you're in the in the zone which the the area in question, if you will. Okay. Marie Benedek, Dehaze chairman. Say COO Michelle Bauer. And Ira. So, so quiet. I'm sorry if I mispronounce your name. Why don't you guys all come to the front row here? If you heard your name called and Marie Benedict, you are first. You have 6 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Council members, my name is Marie Benedict. I am a property owner in the proposed historic district and I live on Osceola Street. I'm very much in support of this historic designation. Thank you for the opportunity to speak. A large team of volunteers from Parker's Hill has worked tirelessly for over 20 months, reaching out to neighbors, first fostering conversation and answering questions. The high level of support from over 77% of the properties who took a position is the result of that extensive outreach. I would like to ask everyone who's here in support today to stand up briefly to be recognized. Thank you very much. We are proud to be in front of you today with a proposed district that meets or exceeds all necessary requirements for passage. We appreciate the opportunity to bring this forward in a Democratic effort with strong support among property owners. And we appreciate the opportunity to have a say in our future for our neighborhood. Our extensive outreach campaign is one of the aspects of our nomination that has received recognition. Also, volunteers have raised over $7,000 to support the historic research and the multiple, multiple rounds of outreach in all different forms, including door knocking, block coffees, producing several informational fliers that were shared with all property owners, creating a Web site, sending out 24 emails, I think, and mailers by mail as well by U.S. Postal Service. Five of those. Since December of 2016, we have urged homeowners to provide their response to the proposal numerous times, including several times via regular mail. They could respond via phone, email or a two question Internet survey. You have the result of those responses, with 75 owners in support and 21 in opposition. For anyone who told us that they were in support, we held them to a very, very high standard. We checked that they were the property owners of that particular property against the DeMars assessor's database. We also made sure that all owners of a particular property sign and support a form for that property, and we submitted 75 of those forms. And you should have something that looks like this. Many of them with two signatures or I don't think we have more, so many of them with two signatures in your materials during the 20 plus months of outreach. We checked several times against the assessor's list to identify properties that had sold, and we removed those signature forms of properties that had sold. The last such check we did around August nine, as we were preparing to go to Ludy to bring this to city council. We believe that our neighborhood is worthy of protection and that a historic district is the best tool for preserving the 150 plus historic buildings in it. And we believe it's good for all property owners in the district. The stability and balance that a historic district brings will be good for all property owners, and it's also the only protection that is on offer for you to decide on tonight. We know from experience that any other tool would take 5 to 10 years to work out if it had support, and that at that point, it may well be too late to protect this historic place. We're proud to present you with with our application for inclusion as a Denver landmark district. And we hope that our efforts will be rewarded with passage of this bill. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Ms.. Benedict Dehaze, you have 3 minutes. Hi. My name is Dehaze. I own my home at 3218 Newton Street and I'm strongly opposed to the historic district. And I'm unhappy with a few neighbors. Who want to change my property. Rights after I've lived there 33 years. I'm 82 years old and I. Believe the tax credit. Scheme is unfair to me and my elderly homeowner neighbors. The increasing costs and. And. It, and additional regulations are often also discriminatory to us. I'm a retired R.N. and my beneficiary is a501c3 National Nursing Organization that supports registered nurses who are in severe, dire circumstances, illness, injury and so forth. And. I want when my time comes. I want my personal representatives to be able to sell my house. To anyone who wants to pay the most money. And I don't want it to have a whole lot of onerous design restrictions and regulations. Please vote no. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Chairman. Seiko. Good evening. My name is. I'm sorry, Chairman Sekou. He's right behind you. Come on. Come on, Sicko. Oh, I thought it was charming, Slater. Sorry. I got to tell you, that's probably the funniest public hearing in town. Yeah. Let's give it a round of applause. That's a lot of courage to represent me. Okay. Yeah, go ahead, Judge. Yeah. All right. Sure. My name is Chairman Sekou. I'm the. Founder and organizer of the Black Star Action Movement for Self-defense. Who represents poor working, poor, homeless and senior citizens throughout the city and county of Denver. I stand before you? Neither for or opposed to this thing. But to appeal to the conscience of folks as we go through this democratic process to see if we can figure this thing out. Because after it's all said and done, everybody got to go back and be neighbors. Is that right? Yeah. And it's okay to disagree without being disagreeable. Right. Because we're civilized. All right. And part of the political process is not to do the pro versus con, but to blend the two together. So it's a win win thing. If the if the yes is when all the time or the no wins all the time. Bad trade deal. Bad trade deal. Because what you create is disharmony within the city that requires unity. In order for us to build a place where we can be free and live in harmony with one another and feel good about being in the city of Denver. And so it's not just about proclaiming propaganda wise that we are a family. Oh, this is a great city or what? How do you live like that? How do you live like that? You've got to tell the truth how you feel. And folks got to respect that. So part of the process of learning how to blend and harmonize is that the know got to put themselves in the shoes of the yes's and the yes has got to put their self in the shoes of the nose. And now we're talking about a very basic principle call. We go work and play well with each other. That was the criteria in kindergarten for the kids before you got a, B, C, D, you flunked. So we can't block on that. And we got to grow up. From our. Places of self interest. And talk about. Hey. We can do this. We can do this. Are we talking about is regulations? And we're talking about policy. And all of that can change. See what we do a blending. We do a blending. And we've got to blend, amend this so that we don't end up mixed up in the mess. And so the name of this game today is called Challenges, Choices and Solutions. CC Yes, if it ain't about the challenge. Not the problem. Because we can solve it causes us. We can do this. And it's about the choices that we make. Consider all the folks feelings, interests. And then do it in a way that makes common sense. That it will work. You're filming your film. Come on, now. So part of our responsibility is leadership. Is to make sure that all the voices are heard. Before we make the decision. And then consider how this thing can go. Where we can have unity and peace in the city so that we can grow up and be a place of attraction for other folks and a role model for how you can do this. And we can blend this and be an example of how we can make this nation great. So great the way we used to be neighbors. And we're going to stay neighbors. And we're going to stop all of this acrimony, frame this in a way like the president was saying, you know, and, hey, calm down, you know. You know, it must be exciting. Boy, I look serious and that. This. Sacred, you know, I got one more minute and 34 seconds, so I'm going to do what you suggested. Okay. Because other people need to talk. I pretty much said what I wanted to say, and I thank you very much for entertaining the possibility. And hey, give peace a chance. You'll feel me there making sense. Oh. That must say. Cool. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Michelle Bauer. Good evening. My name is Michelle Bower. I live at 3344 Mead Street in Denver. I have lived there about 18 years and my husband has owned the home for about 22. I'm here today to say that I'm in opposition of this bill. I can completely empathize with my neighbors, who I see in this room who have struggled with the evolution of just a little three storey high rise and now a five storey high rise and and some kind of funky construction that's gone in the neighborhood. But I don't think the landmark district designation is the solution to protecting our rights in the city. I do believe that we have a city and county government that regulates building and construction, and I would encourage our community to step back and take a look at that regulations being enforced. One of the things that drew us to this community to live. My husband first and myself after we married, we didn't choose to live someplace else was the inclusiveness of the community. And I feel like a landmark designation. Was it exclusive? I think it makes us a different community and I think it creates barriers. So I would really encourage this committee and this group to reconsider the landmark designation and look at other options. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Ms.. Bauer. IRA. So. I'm sorry if. Thank you. It's Ira Kelkoo. It's your account. Okay. I was close. Okay. Sorry, sir. You have 6 minutes. Thank you. My wife and I own and live at 3343 Osceola Street in the proposed district. And we are strongly in favor of the application for historic district designation. Historic designation is not about saving pretty houses. It's about creating community and a sense of place. And in our e-mails in favor of the district, we emphasized our desire to maintain our community's character while allowing for complimentary new construction. We're not anti-development. We're pro sensible development that provides a sense of place. And in my comments today, I would like to focus on the arguments raised by the opponents to the designation. They would have you believe that design review associated with historic designation is an overly bureaucratic process that unnecessarily delays renovation projects or demolition of properties. They would further have you believe that design review makes a property less marketable and violates property rights. These alternative facts, however, are in reality a false narrative, and they should not be the basis of your decision today. These are the actual facts. Studies consistently show that properties in a historic district appreciate more quickly and in a greater amount than in similar non-designated areas. And why is that? That's because people today, homeowners today are seeking out unique areas with character, not just an area that would be similar to many other areas. They want a specific, unique area. Also, another very important fact is that according to the most recent statistics available, the landmark Commission's approval rate for design review requests was 99% of these approvals. Over 81% were administratively approved in an expedited fashion by the Landmark Preservation Staff without ever having a need for a formal landmark commission review. That directly relates to the argument that you'll hear that there is great delay associated with the process of design review. 81% of requests are handled quickly. By the staff. And then even with the entire amount of requests, 99% get approved. Design review can preserve property values if viewed in the spirit of a partnership between the Landmark Preservation Commission and the property owner to maintain an area's integrity and rather than as an adversarial process. Also only exterior changes that require a building permit require design review. For instance, interior changes and landscaping do not require any design review. As far as the role of government goes, a basic and accepted role of government is to maintain orderly community development, especially in areas of stability, which blueprint Denver has denoted the Packard Hill area. Local historic preservation ordinances such as the one in Denver, were upheld by the United States Supreme Court as a proper role of government and not in violation of property rights. This decision from the U.S. Supreme Court was decided in 1978. It was the Penn Central case, and it was decided, therefore, almost 40 years ago. It's a settled issue that this is not a violation of property rights. A local historic designation ordinance. The vast majority of property owners in the proposed Packard Hill historic district do not object to historic designation. Those that do object are relying on scare tactics without a basis. In fact, and my wife and I urge you to vote yes in favor of the application to designate the Packard SEAL historic district. Thank you very much for your consideration. And thank you. I just want to say the first five did really well in coming in their time. And thank you for setting the tone. All right. Next five, come up quickly. Paul Hudgens, Chris Myles, Ricardo Gonzalez, Yvette Harrell and Bradley Brubaker. Paul HODGINS You have three months. HEDGES So sorry. You have 3 minutes. Thanks. Good evening. My name is Paula Jones. I'm the owner of 3344 Newton Street in the proposed district. I would like to start, first of all, by pointing out that this. Is the design guidelines for Denver landmark structures and districts. This is a double sided. This is what all of us become subject to. If this bill passes tonight. I see this as nothing less than a wholesale taking of my property rights. I bought this house in May of 2001, and since that time, I have mentally constructed the house that I want to build on my lot. And then which my wife and I want to retire. Please don't do this to me. To us. Or to Denver. It is profoundly unfair. Thank you, Mrs. Hudgens. Chris Miles. Hi. Thank you for letting me speak. My name is Chris Mars. I live on 3286 Mead Street. I'm in the zone. I'm a fourth generation North Denver native. And I'm going to tell you a story of how my family got to this neighborhood. In the early 1900s, my great grandfather as a young teenager was traveling the country working for Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. He was a ranch hand simple cowboy, and one of his jobs was to take care of Buffalo Bill's personal horses. According to what has been passed down to me, Buffalo Bill was not an easy person to work for. And in the words of my great grandfather, he was a mean, old drunk. The show had come into Denver and one night Buffalo Bill came into the tent where the horses and livestock were held. He was a mean drunk and ready for a fight. An argument broke out and Buffalo Bill fired my great grandfather. He was out on the street with no way to get back to where he had come from. A couple of years later, he got back on his feet and by the end of the 19 oh, by the early 19 tens, he had bought a house on the block of 33rd and Quitman, right on the edge of Packard Hill's historic district and three blocks from where I live now. He married one of these bold temperance ladies that you've heard about in the presentation earlier. That's a whole nother story. And raised his family in this house on Quitman. This house is where my grandfather grew up in the twenties and thirties. 82% of this neighborhood that my great grandfather came to over a hundred years ago is still there. 82% of the neighborhood my grandfather and mother roamed as kids are still there. The architecture, the history and the front porch culture that started with my great grandfather is still there. We have a unique opportunity here to help preserve this historic neighborhood for generations to come. Throughout the neighborhood. I've noticed throughout my neighbors, there's a pretty strong support for this historic district. But a few of my neighbors still feel this is the wrong direction. But I still love them. Unfortunately, a lot of this has been fostered by misinformation and exaggeration. This has not been helpful in this process. But I have found many people, once they take the time to get the facts straight, they see benefits and they see and their support. They see the benefits and they are supportive of the historic designation. On my street, Meade Street. We are very a very close group of neighbors. Every Friday and Saturday, around 5:00, we are out on the porches, enjoying life in our awesome neighborhood. This will continue. And I look forward to all of us coming together after this decision is made and celebrating this neighborhood that we love. Both sides. Tonight, I ask you, members of city council to side with the homeowners and residents in helping to preserve this beautiful neighborhood that my great grandfather came to so long ago. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Miles. Ricardo Gonzalez, please hold. Please hold your applause. I know there's going to be a lot of great speeches, but just give us a little time. Ricardo Gonzalez, thank you. Hello. My name is Ricardo Gonzalez. I grew up at 3271 Mead Street. I've seen a lot of changes over the years as I was growing up there going to North High. And one of the things that always impressed me is how the neighborhood has changed. I like the changes. There's a few changes. That happened that I disagree with. But they're pretty cool. If you get take a look and see what's happened into the neighborhood and left. I'll say 40 plus years. One of the things that I'm always hearing, the historic designation will make it a stable neighborhood. It is a stable neighborhood already. Why do we need to have the historic designation to make it stable? It's already there. Just take a look through the neighborhood. Look what some of our neighbors have done. They've taken some of their old bungalows. Made beautiful pop tops out of them. Phenomenal. I love it. And I keep seeing more. And I'm like, okay, this is a changing neighborhood. Still got some old character. Got some history there. Why not change it? One of the things that drove me nuts is when I took the gentleman showed. How thick that guideline is. I'm an engineer. I enforce codes quite frequently. I have to read them. I have to understand them. The common person is not going to understand that. It's going to cost them a lot of money. To hire an architect, hire an engineer to get that information pass through. It's going to cost a. Lot of money. We don't need the historic district for it. If they really want to maintain their house and I'm said this is for the ones who want the designation. If they want to maintain their house as a historic district, do like they did y'all showed of that stone house. It's beautiful. The sun Lowell. Drive by it frequently. Get have them get their houses, go ahead and put an historic register their house, not everybody's house. Don't force us all to have to go to another book to have to read, to understand it, and then find out that some parts of it do conflict with the building code. Do conflict with electrical code. They say it's all external, but that's. A lot of work. The outside is what makes a house a home, but it's what's inside as well. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Gonzales. Yvette Herrell. Good evening, our city council. I think probably a lot of what I would say has already been said, and I know we're limited for time, so I'll try to make it short. Oh. I live at. 3425 Lowe Boulevard. And I very much support this historic district. 3425 Laurel Boulevard. As most of you may already know, it's the stone house. That's the cook's house. When John and I looked. For a place to live. We looked around Denver, lots of different. Neighborhoods, and we chose this one. We chose the neighborhood first. Before we chose our house. And then we looked around the neighborhood for a while and this house came for sale and we were fortunate enough to buy it. There have been changes in our neighborhood, but not I wouldn't. Say substantial changes. The neighborhood seems to be very stable now, but our concern is that what would happen in the future? We would like to keep it. Where, you know, the architecture is. Complementary. We're not opposed. At all to new development or, you know, people redoing their homes. We just would like to keep it so that it stays. With the character that we have. Now. It's historic, in fact. Denis Gallagher used to do a lot of his tours through our neighborhood. In fact, I heard him out on our porch with a whole lot of people one time looking at the house and our house next to that house, next door to us was built by David Cox, the same stonemason who was , you know, early he was an early. Denver stonemason. Did a lot of work around Denver. A lot of his work is. On a lot of the historic buildings that we have. And by the way, our house is a his it's on the historic registry. And I'm very glad that it is because it preserves it'll. Preserve it for our future. And I think that there are a lot of people in the future who will, you know, who will want these kind of places. And once they're gone, you can't ever give them back. We'll never get it back. It's gone. And I think it would be nice to just save it for our city and for future generations to come and like to. Look through like they do today. Because we have. People who. Come in and walk through the. Neighborhood and take pictures. And enjoy just being there because it's such a nice place. I have a big, long speech here, but I'm not. Going to do it because I'm sure it'll get covered. And I know you're all one to go to, so. But I do want to express that I would really love to see our neighborhood saved and and really the folks that are opposed. We would never hold that against them. This I know this. Is our democratic. Process. And we're going to all be neighbors and. Try to stay friends. Thank you, miss. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Bradley Brubaker. Thank you. I'm Brad Brubaker. My wife and I bought our home at 3253 mead seven years ago. So we are also in the zone. We chose West Highland for a lot of reasons, but mainly because there were so many good things going on in the neighborhood. And I'd like for those good things to continue. And I'll say that my wife and myself and my four year old and my two year old strongly oppose. The historic designation. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Brew Maker. All right, we have five more. Please come to the front when you hear your name. Court. Linda Paulson. Madeline O'Connell. Annie Levinsky. Kevin O'Connell. Patricia Kunkel. Yup. That's five. Linda Paulson, you were first. My name is Linda Paulson. I own my home at three, four. Two, one. Newton Street in the proposed district. You know, there's something remarkable about an old neighborhood, a sense of history and familiar landmarks are powerful elements which. Foster a connectedness between neighbors. That's why I'm 100% in favor of. Designating my neighborhood Packard's Hill, the newest historic district in Denver. I feel very lucky to have purchased one of. The more unique homes in this district 27 years ago. 14 years ago, I thought it would be necessary for me to move in order to accommodate. The need for more studio space. The thought of leaving my cherished neighborhood was quite unbearable. Instead, I worked with an architect to design an addition that would compliment the house while respecting the. Existing streetscape and, more importantly, respecting my neighbors. I would say the result is a success. Learning more about the. Origins of this district and its. Notable women has been a joy to this history buff. In fact. The person who pulled the. Permit in 1911. To build my house was named Minnie McGrew. As compelling as the history of this district is. An unexpected side benefit for me of this movement towards historic designation has been the joy of meeting neighbors who love this area. As much as I do. I urge you to help us in preserving this unique neighborhood and not just our little piece of turf. But for the long term benefit of the city of Denver. As I have personally met a few of you. I have been consistently. Impressed by your interest and. Dedication to our city, and I thank you for that. Thank you, Miss Balsam. All right. Madeline O'Connell. My name is Madeline O'Connell. I live in Denver at 32, 75 and 3273. Osceola in the district. And I have lived there for over 22 years, and I'm an artist in the neighborhood. I'm against the proposed district because I feel it is an overreaching attempt at stopping change in our neighborhood. I believe there are other ways to address the growing pains without such excessive impact on homeowners. The process is also flawed and undemocratic. We have been up against significant resources of the city and historic district. I have met with the proponents of the district several times over the last year, have asked questions and voiced many concerns. What I got in return was a lot of that's a good question and I'll get back to you on that. It never got inadequate response. I went to community meetings and endured long presentations from the career historically and was offered, was offended that our time for questions was shortened by their overruns as well as out of district pro historic shills asking questions. As an example of the overreach, I showed a photo of our 2004 contemporary home to John Olsen. I was told that the design does not conform to the historic guidelines, and if destroyed in a catastrophic event such as a fire, we would not be able to rebuild our home the way it was and be made whole. How is it possible that our security in our home, we designed and built can be threatened in the name of history? Basically. That is unknown artist who lived there a century ago is so important that I need to conform to her style of home. Living in a historic district would increase our insurance premium, according to our agent. The imposition of the 226 pages of rules will cost property owners time and money, hurting the elderly and the lower income residents the most, who also won't benefit benefit from the state tax rebate, which I was told was better than nothing wrong. It's discrimination and elitist. This process is told a great personal expense of hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars, not to mention emotional angst. There's a palpable resentment in our neighborhood. Becoming a historic district will cause more problems than it solves. Personally, I feel beat up by the process and I'm left with this. Final plea to my city council to hear me and vote no on Packer Till. Thank you, Mr. McConnell. Any Levinsky. Hi. I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of Historic Denver, where a. Nonprofit organization. With 750 members from around the city. And we've been advocates for historic places for 47 years. I'm here just to provide a little. Bit of perspective about historic districts, how. They come to be and why they matter to our city. Denver's preservation ordinance was created 51 years ago. Larimer Square became the city's. First historic district, followed by Humboldt Island historic district near Cheesman. Park was the first residential district. That decision and as was Larimer Square. We're not without conflict, but they are now deeply. Appreciated by us to enjoy. Over the last 50 years, City Council has seen fit to create 52 historic districts. Those 52 districts include a range in size from 1 to 1000. These districts contain less than 5% of Denver's buildings and an even smaller percentage of the city's land area. The average historic district in Denver includes 140 structures, making Packard's hill a very typical size. So why districts? Why designate a group of properties rather than only individual property is because it's the ensemble that gives identity, quality and character to a district. Can you imagine LoDo if we only had one warehouse on Wynkoop? It is also the ensemble that offers benefits to those inside, including the residential tax credit program. Other also we have created. 52 districts in 51 years. We have not created a district every year. The last two districts are. Spaced apart by nearly six years, with the creation of the final. Curtis Park District in 2011 and the South Lincoln Historic District in 2016. As you know, South Lincoln was an unusually small district. So as a city as a whole, we have not created an average sized historic district for over six years. I highlight this to demonstrate that historic district proposals are not undertaken lightly or frivolously. Furthermore, in those years, we have also witnessed high. Levels of demolition in our older neighborhoods. There have been over 3000. Demolitions of primary structures since that last average size historic district. The majority of these were single family structures in single family zoned districts, and that might defy perception. But it's important to understand because it shows that in large part the loss of our historic fabric is not being done to increase the number of housing units, but simply the size of the preservation ordinance. In its first declaration states that the protection enhancement, perpetuation. And use of structures of and districts of historic architectural and geographic significance is a public necessity. And it is required in the interest of the prosperity, civic pride and general welfare. Of the people. That's no less true today than it was 50 years ago, and the applicant neighborhoods of Patrick of Packard's Hill have done all. That has been asked of them to meet a high standard of significance. And documentation and a high standard of public outreach. This is an appropriate and reasonable use of the historic district tool, and we urge your support. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. Levinsky. Kevin O'Connell. Thank you. I'm Kevin O'Connell. I'm going to slow it down a little bit. I live at 32, 73, 37, 75, and I've been there 22 years. Here's what we know today. Today, we know everyone here in this room cares about our neighborhood. We know no one in this room wants to see it destroyed. And we all have concerns about unbridled and unrelenting growth. But we also know the preservation ordinance is broken. It gives there's no distinction between a house or a group of houses. If this district passes, it will in fact cause harm to some of my neighbors. We know that within the boundaries more people are against the district than are for it. And if you are for the district, please raise your hand. Anyone. If you don't live in the district, put your hand down. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey. Mr. O'Connor. Home and the community. The neighborhood. Address. Address us, please. Thank you. Essentially, we're dealing with David versus Goliath. We're the David to the preservation Goliath. I'm asking three things tonight. Of the district vote against the formation of the council, rather. Vote against the formation of the district. Modify the preservation ordinance so we can have a consensus based approach to. Preservation. And develop metrics so that everyone knows what a standard is to make a place historic. Now it's just the support. And as you can see, we have very widely differing ideas of which support is the path forward is going to take time and effort. I know we can do it. And reaching out to Councilman Espinosa, my neighbors, to develop a set of criteria we can all agree on, let's find a consensus to move forward and save our neighborhood. But we have other options instead of jamming it on people. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. O'Connell. All right, Patricia Kunkel. My name is Patricia Kunkel, and I'm a property owner in the proposed district at 3417 Mead Street, and I absolutely support the designation. I live in a 1908 classic cottage and truly believe the proposed district is a win win for all property owners here. A historic district would mean we can welcome infill development because it would seek to complement and enhance the distinctive character that drew us here and which we all cherish. And it would ensure that we wouldn't lose over 150 properties that are historic and that contribute to the feel and enjoyment of our neighborhood. No other tool would do that. And that is why I think it is the right thing to do to protect the character and history of our neighborhood. Also, Denver guidelines, which apply in all historic districts. Would help guide. New construction additions, extensions and pop ups. They would ensure the changes to the homes in our neighborhood are compatible with the home being modified as well as the neighborhood as a whole. In my opinion, that is very reasonable and I hear from many sources that Denver guidelines are very reasonable. They are designed to encourage. Adaptive reuse, reuse of solid existing homes while allowing for modernization and extensions to fit today's lifestyles and needs. And these guidelines are just that guidelines. They are not written in stone. They are do allow for flexibility in how the cause of compatibility has reached. I urge you to help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Miss Kunkle. All right. We have the next five. When you hear your name called, come up to the front. Matthew Brown, Trevor Greco, Christina Holderness, Marilyn Quinn and Alex Holderness. Matthew Brown, you are first. Thank you. I live at 3341 Newton Street, right in the heart of the proposed district, and I strongly oppose it. My house kind of looks like the house. And up right now I've got. A couple of duplexes, a couple of houses down that are already built. Couple of pop tops around me. I'm fine with all of it. It's development. It's the way it goes. But, you know, the horse has kind of been let out of the barn in the neighborhood. The developments already been happening. I don't think it's fair for the council to impose something that's going to make it very difficult for me to do what I want to do to my house, which is pop the top in character with the neighborhood. It would be financially irresponsible for me to do it if this bill passes. If that happens, I will be moving out of my house, moving somewhere else and turning my house into a rental property at some point. I've got two young kids and my house will not be big enough. So. At this point, I just urge you to vote no on this proposal. I don't like the development that's going on necessarily, but I don't think that you can legislate taste. Thank you. Can you say your name just for the record? I don't know if Nancy Brown. Okay, great. Thank you. All right. Trevor Greco. Thank you. My name is Trevor Greco, and I live at 32. 84 was Yola. I'm in the zone. I wanted to cover one topic that I haven't heard yet tonight. And I really appreciate the neighbors telling their stories, and I really do appreciate that. But there's also one one other aspect is that historic districts help preserve, and that's about sustainability. So I live in a 1908 cottage, simple cottage. And, you know, the by definition, living and preserving that building is green and good for the environment because of the embodied energy that's already been used. All the all the resources back 100 years ago, it's 108 years old, was was sourced locally. Most of our homes in our district are brick. They've lasted for 100 years. They're going to last for another hundred years. And according to the EPA's 2014, which is their last report on waste, construction and demolition waste as was 200 are sorry, four 534 million tons and half of that or sorry twice. Let me clarify this. So twice the amount of of waste that we put into the dump every year is from construction and demolition. So think about it this way, is that our waste management goes around the city and collects garbage from city, from residential and commercial businesses. Twice that amount of garbage every week is put into our dump. And we think, well, how much of it of that is demolition versus construction? 90% of that is demolition. Demolition is the major contributor to our waste issues here, helping preserve encouraging people to reuse the adaptive reuse that you've already heard tonight encourages that reuse of the facilities that we already have. We can still build our homes bigger, pop the tarps, build the basements, the extensions, basically. It's just this is so unnecessary, especially in an area of ours where all the homes are brick or most of them are, as I said, they've stood for a hundred years there, stand for several hundreds more . So with that, I urge you to please preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Greco. Christina Holderness. Hello. My name is Christina Holderness. I own the property at 3221 Osceola in the proposed district. I am adamantly opposed to creating this district. Thank you so much for letting me speak tonight. I want to tell you that the landmark committee and the pro historic petitioners claim that there has not been has not been any significant objection . To this proposed district, and this is untrue. There is significant opposition to the district. To illustrate this fact, I made a poster to show you how many residents are opposed, which represents about half of the 175 residences in the designated area. I realize all of you have a lot of paperwork and perhaps the thousands of documents you receive all the time. You may not be able to review, but I would just like a moment to show you. Everything in red is a house that has said. Can you can you get a little closer? Can you get in front of that mike there? That's a great. So when I printed the poster, that's when I printed this poster. We had 72 residents opposed. Now we have 75, according to the petition. With that many residents opposed, we honestly we don't have consensus on this. We don't have a meaningful majority in our neighborhoods. Supporting the district to approve the district is really to disregard the concerns and rights of almost half of the constituents impacted by the decision. I ask you all. Even if my posters showed half red x's so instead of 72, there were 35. Do you feel does it seem ethical and fair to impose this designation on our neighborhood? If I were sitting in your chairs, I would think we would need 80 or 90% consensus. We don't have that. I am not against preserving historical buildings and monuments. I appreciate the value of history. I appreciate all the work everyone has done. But there must be a less contentious way to accomplish that goal. Perhaps an overlay. We have approached our council member as well as the pro historic group to ask for an overlay and it has been met with a resounding no. It won't work. It seems actually so fair. Allowing neighbors the freedom of design's householders. Yes. Your time is up. Okay. I'm sorry. Thank you. All right. Marilyn Quinn. Okay. I am Marilyn Quinn. I live at 3249 West Fairview Place, two blocks outside the proposed historic district in a property with historic designation. I'm also co-chair of the West Highland Design and Preservation Committee. In 2015, our committee first identified the Packard's. Hill area as having potential to be a historic. District. And we applied for a state historic fund grant that helped to pay much of the cost of research. To prepare the nomination. Change is inevitable, but the old and new can co-exist. Denver's design guidelines helped guide growth and change in a way that respects our history and protects property values without unduly burdening homeowners. Northwest Denver is seeing a lot of change, according to. CPD records. During the past six years. About one third of the permits issued in the city for residential demolition, residential construction and permission to demolish historic buildings were issued in just one of Denver's 11 Districts Council District one. Where Packard Hill is located. It can be disturbing to return from a short trip and find familiar landmarks gone. I'd like to echo Mayor Hancock's words from June 25th Denver Post. When you lose the houses, restaurants and places where roots were grown, you lose those stories and that history. You lose the soul of a neighborhood. And our city loses a piece of itself that it won't ever get back again. We don't want to lose Packard Hill, as you've been told. 52 Denver neighborhoods are designated as historic districts, but only four of those are in northwest Denver, where development pressure is dramatically and irreversibly altering our built environment. As you can see in the nomination, this area's rich history has value to its residents, to residents of West Highland, and to the city of Denver. Some Packard Hill neighbors oppose creation of the district, as did some when we created the Ghost Historic District. Most of those who were opposed in Ghost now support the historic district completely. Their concerns about burdensome regulations did not turn out to be a problem, and they have seen the benefits of added stability and certainty in the neighborhood. I'm sure you know about LoDo or Larimer District. When it was created it was over objections of 80 to 90% of the property owners there. But now it's one of the highest valued areas in Colorado. I hope and trust this will be the case in Packard Hill when it is the historic district. I respectfully request that you act tonight to help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Quinn. All right, Alex Holderness, you have 6 minutes. My name is Alex Holderness. I own the home at 3221, Osceola, the non contributing structure, one of the 18% in the minority. In this particular situation. Dear Council members, thank you for your time tonight and for allowing us to participate in the governance process. Please bear with me. I'm going to read my comments because I want to make sure that the fear and anxiety, both regarding this process and in standing in front of you, do not get the better of me. I sent a letter to all of you and to the Landmark Committee on August 31st, 2017, expressly expressing my personal concerns and asking for your vote no tonight. Apparently, we are subject to alternative facts and scare tactics. Let me tell you my facts and let you be scared by what I heard from the people that I spoke with. In that letter if you didn't read it it for the benefit of the people here. There are two distinct reasons that I oppose this district. Number one, I am not a longtime Denver resident. I moved from San Francisco seven years ago. I've lived in mostly major U.S. cities. I am exactly the person who is moving to Denver. I moved here and bought a house in that area because it is interesting and because I intended to scrap it and build a modern home on it. If you pass this that intention, the entire reason that I moved into that home will be scrapped because my esthetic does not align with the guidelines I've been given. They are contemporary and there are options, but they are not modern. Make no mistake, that is a fact. The second fact is that I spoke to a developer who calls me regularly about another property I own in District one in the West Colfax District and tries to buy it from me. And I asked him specifically, what would you pay me for? 3221 Osceola knowing that it's in the historic district. The short answer was about $100,000 less than it's worth today. That is a fact. It is a conversation I had. If you choose to disagree with that fact and call it alternative, I can't stop you. If you choose to be scared by that, you stand in my shoes. I understand the reason for history and I appreciate and support many, many of the things being said here. But this is not truthfully what's about what's best for me. Driving through Denver today, I realized that this issue reflects on a small and local scale the problems and challenges that we are currently driving a wedge through this nation. This should be about preserving history in a way that allows people, both current and future, to benefit and learn from the past. It should be a proud moment for neighbors to gather together as a community. It should be a time of celebrating the preservation of beautiful things. But instead, like so many topics across our nation, it has become divisive, hostile and contentious. It has pitted neighbor against neighbor in an escalating battle to show who is more powerful, who has the pull, and who can get their agenda to emerge victorious. It is not about homes or history. Not anymore. If it were, we would have sat down with our councilperson and worked out a marriage arrangement that's best for all community members. We didn't do that. We didn't come together as neighbors to create something that's good for all of us. We did not sit down with unbiased leadership of our councilperson to work through this as an opportunity to become stronger, more cohesive and engaged in this community. Instead, we chose to pursue our own self-interest, whether our personal financial interest, like my own in my letter, our personal political ambitions and loyalties, or increasingly our personal grievances and anger over feeling marginalized and unimportant in the eyes of our neighbors and elected leaders. This is the exact dynamic that is tearing apart this nation. Our self-righteous self-interest and the anger that being selfish creates towards those who threaten to expose it. Tonight, Denver has a chance to show the country that we are stronger together than we are divided, and that in order to remain together, we must work at it. It's hard finding common ground. It's hard to include others. It's hard to think you're going to lose. But then when we fight, we all lose anyway. Approving the issue before. You will not accomplish something great, but rather will drive a permanent and lasting wedge of anger and resentment between the neighbors who stand on opposite sides. So please, Denver City Council. Use this moment not to pass the bill as it stands, but to encourage us as neighbors to unite together as a community, to work together, to reach compromise and to acknowledge that we are different people with differing opinions and that it is this difference that makes us great together. Please vote no. Thank you, Mr. Holderness. And now we have the next five. Folks, please come up here. Renee ou, Kelly Geller, Nilo. Sorry. I may have a misspelling there. Rene Gee, if you'd come up to the front. Mark Brandis. Nancy Chase. Mary Lemieux and Jody Robbins. Great. Renee, you are up first. My name is Renee Kalinga, and I'm a property owner in Osceola, and I very much support the historic designation. I've lived in North Denver for 27 years and I've seen a lot of changes. And I've seen changes impacting senior citizens who live in my neighborhood. Families with children of different ages. And some families that have been second or more generations in the same household. Our neighborhood has a very high degree of historic integrity. 82%. In the variety of home sizes and styles in our neighborhood reflect both the building styles that were available to builders at that time and also the economic up and downs during that time. The different sizes of buildings from modest to elaborate provided a welcome diversity of home sizes, which help provide some variety of price points at which people could come into the neighborhood. As a result, we have some people at all stages of life different family sizes and somewhat different incomes. We really appreciate the diversity of home sizes and we would like to keep that. Unfortunately, whenever a historic home is lost in our area and replaced with something new, the new building is always priced somewhere in or thousand to a million. That only hurts the ability of many people to be able to afford living in our neighborhood and contributes to unaffordability. We really appreciate the diversity of housing stock that we have and believe a store district will contribute to keeping some of that diversity in the future. After 27 years of living there, I've had many opportunities to leave the neighborhood to sell our home. But I and my family know we we stay there because of the neighborhood feel. And we believe that historic designation would help protect the neighborhood feel that has been there for 20 or 27 years. We've been there. Thank you. Knows your vote and support historic district. Thank you, sir. All right, mark. Brenda's. Good evening. My name is Mark Brandis. I live in the district 30 to 49 Osceola Street. My late wife and I bought this property about 26 years ago. It is a Victorian that was built in 1891. It was a four unit apartment building when we bought it, and prior to that it had been converted to a boarding house from a single family and my wife and I converted it back into a single family residence. We have put a lot of time, money, sweat equity into this particular property. My goal in working on this property was to preserve it as a old Victorian. And when I work on the property I keep that in mind and the work that I do tries to bring it back to what it was originally. I feel that a historic designation is inappropriate for this particular area. Unfortunately, I have seen this area go from being very ethnically diverse to very gentrified. My concern is that historic designation will increase that gentrification. It definitely creates more hurdles that individuals have to jump through in order to work on this particular piece of property. With all due respect to my neighbor, as far as landscaping goes, you have to get permission in order to landscape and make changes to your landscape. And that's under the guidelines for preservation of historic structures. 5.1. It is not an easy process. If you want to do anything major, you have to go to your neighborhood association first, then you have to go to Landmark Preservation Committee and then you have to deal with zoning and then you have to hear building and zoning and that increases the time and expense. I do a lot of work on my property, on my own. I work a full time job. I'm an attorney, but I work on my own property. I spent 8 hours this weekend working on my property. I don't need the extra hassle and the extra expense. And quite frankly, I think that a proposed historic designation on this property is really a slap in the face to people like myself who bought into a very, very sketchy neighborhood and have contributed towards the great turnaround that we have in this neighborhood. It's a great place to live. I like my neighbors. Pro and con, either side. And we're still going to be friends no matter how you all vote on this tonight. But I don't believe that it's in our neighborhoods interest to limit what property owners can do with their property. I understand technically it is not a quote unquote taking under the First Amendment pursuant to the Penn Central Station case. But realistically, it's a taking when you're limiting what I can do with my property, when you're telling me what I can do with my landscaping, that I have to maintain a Denver slope instead of putting in a retaining wall when I have to comply with certain rules and regulations for what type of doors and windows I want to put into my structure and where I want to put it into my structure. I think that really invades on my rights as a property owner, and it really just it doesn't give me credit for all of the work that I have put into this particular property. After Brandis, the time is up. Vote no, please. Thank you. All right, Nancy Chase. Nancy Chase. My name is Nancy Chase. And I'm a property owner near the proposed historic district. I live at 4130 Lowe Boulevard for over 35 years. I very much support the Packard Hill historic district. And I thank you for the opportunity to speak. I agree with many of my neighbors. I would like to see this historic area preserved and its history and remembered. Have it remembered and celebrated? It's amazing that we have such a high degree of historic homes and buildings in the North Denver area, and I hope you find this area worthy of protecting. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Miss Chase. All right, Mary Lemieux. Hi. Thank you for letting me speak. I'm Mario Lemieux and I live at 3257. UCLA in the District. I haven't written anything eloquent. I just would like to say that I feel like it's infringing on my rights as a property owner. I've been in the home for 19 years. I bought in a non historic district. We all did. And now it feels like you guys are winning. Or there's people in our neighborhood that are wanting to change the rules on us. I urge you to vote. No, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lemieux. Jody Robbins. Hello. My name is Jody Robbins. I'm a property owner in the district. I live on 3415 Newton Street. I very much support this historic district. Thank you for the opportunity for letting me speak. It is it is highly unusual, especially in northwest Denver, to find a neighborhood like Packard's hill that has entire blocks that are intact or nearly intact. Made up of century old homes maintained in such good condition, as you've heard tonight, are historic. Integrity is 82%. We have two historic districts just to the south of us, south of 32nd between Perry and Irving and reaching south the 29th or 30th and historic district. Just to the south of us, Wolf Place was designated. Its degree of integrity was only 61%. So what we have in Packard Cell is truly amazing. We've lost a few historic homes in the last couple of years, and one or two more may be lost in the near future if our area is not designated. Today, we have a unique opportunity to protect a place that is incredibly special and is in history, architecture, integrity, and with fabulous stories of women pushing the boundaries of their roles in society. Please help us preserve this very special place for all of Denver to enjoy today and in the future. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. Mr. ROBINSON. All right. Here we go. Next five, Steve Milk, Betty Luce. Heidi Van Sickle. Elizabeth Clayton. Carol Purdy. Steve Melich, you are up first. Thank you. My name is Steve Milik live at 3257 Oshawa in the proposed district. I've lived at my house for about 20 years. I just learned tonight that it was called Packard Hill. I hadn't heard that before. I am among an abundance of people who take pride in our neighborhood and are good stewards without force. I also learned tonight that we have an 82% integrity without force at all. At the same time, I see disposable highrises going up in this neighborhood that are not historic but always seem to get approval. And if I want to do, say, construct a new garage. I'd have to move mountains. Under the, you know, already more than adequate regulations that exist. I see this is largely pitting neighbors who already have their homes as they want against those that do not or those that simply are against such an overreach on principle. I think this changes the property arrangement that I have with the city against my will, somehow allowing others to infringe on my rights, imposing their preferences and the added costs associated on me and all the others against this overreach. Please vote no on this proposal. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Betty Lewis. Lucy. Good evening. My name is very loose. I live at 2660 mead in Denver, which is my house is about to announce blocks from the district. And I'm a real estate broker with nostalgic homes in our offices in the district right in the corner of 32nd and Newton. The people that founded our company, Tom and Caroline Sinclair, came to the neighborhood in 1985. There was a recession going on in those years. And I'm sure some of you here tonight were. Remember that time? You could have shot a cannon off up 32nd Avenue and you wouldn't have hit anyone. Most of the storefronts. Were not occupied, so there's been great change. They committed themselves to promoting this lovely old neighborhood. There's a. Great love there for his historic. Homes. They are our company over the years. Has helped many, many people move into this neighborhood. And we know why they moved there. They moved there for the ambiance, for the neighborhood. Feeling of the closeness of. Sort of a like a small town where, as people have commented here previously. Many different kinds of people could live. There. Big houses. Small houses. Family houses. Houses for single people. And and be happy there. So I. Speak in favor of approval of this historic district because I think Packard Selah has, as others have mentioned. Great integrity. I think it's important that we save certain parts of our city that remind us of the past and where. People have loved their homes for many, many years. So I would urge you. All to vote. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Heidi Van Sickle. Hi. My name is Heidi Van Sickle and I do not live in the district. I am the first speaker for this group where they've had seven out of district people already. I'm in Councilman Herndon's district and happy happy to be there. But I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry. Sorry for this neighborhood. This pits neighbor against neighbor like you wouldn't believe. We've seen this in Park Hill where this did not go through, thank God. But we had neighbors who were walking dogs. We had neighbors who were hiking and they no longer speak to each other. All right. The point that was for me important was the solar panels. Now I have mine, which saved me about 1500 dollars a year. That's pretty significant amount of cash, especially for the low income neighbors. But the pro historic people would not allow that kind of savings to their neighbors or savings to the community or to the atmosphere itself. The historic Denver allowed review of solar panels in 2013. They allowed that into that big, thick manual of theirs. But you call them and you ask them how many of these solar panels have gone through since 2011, in the last seven years, and they say zero, none of the solar panels have been allowed to go through. I don't believe that historic Denver is an honest broker in these dealings. The cost is more. The windows that you want to replace will be three times the cost than if you wanted to replace them. Without a historic designation. The time is more, but there is a better way. Councilman Herndon had the foresight to see how devastating this is. And now we are talking about a conservation overlay. There's three of us, three of the stop historic, three of the pro historic. And we are meeting consistently with a council designated moderator through Council for Conservation Overlays. It is a better way. I strongly suggest that the Council vote no so that these neighbors can find another way, a better way. They can remove this hostile wedge and they can begin to be the neighbors together again. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Miss Francisco. Elizabeth Clayton. I'm Elizabeth Clayton and I work at Nostalgic Homes at 32nd. And Newton. We are in the district in the proposed district. I've been a real estate agent there for 23 years. We help people buy and sell homes in Denver County. I would say 90% of our business is in this very neighborhood. I can't tell you how fortunate we are in Denver to have the intact. Inner city. Neighborhoods that are so close to downtown that doesn't. Exist in every city. And. Being in a historic district actually adds quite a bit of value to your home, even though people don't even know it's a historic district when they're looking. They're looking for the consistency and the character and the architecture. That's what they're looking for. And it really does add value. So as a real estate agent working in that neighborhood, I would like to encourage you to approve this historic district. Thank you. Ms.. Clayton. Carol Purdy. Hello. My name is Carol Purdy. I live at 3715 West 32nd Avenue. Within the district. Thank you for this opportunity to tell you about my opposition to designating my neighborhood as a historic district. I bought my property because it was dual zoned, both commercial and residential. I would like to start a small business on my property right on West 32nd Avenue in the heart of the Highlands. Unfortunately, the historic designation is arbitrary and unfair. My commercial neighbors down the street, down the block have been exempted from the district while my property has not. If the ordinance is passed for me to undertake a renovation to convert my property to a commercial business would be prohibitively expensive. I strongly urge you to vote no on this ordinance. Thank you. All right. Next five are up, Shaman. Sather. Melissa Ortega. Linda Hilton. Ileana Kreisky. And Julianne Moore. After. Julianne Moore. Sherman Sather. Okay. I'll check the monitor. First to make sure that I'm the right person. Right? Yes. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Okay. Chairman Sekou. I mean, Sherman Sather. Okay. You're up. The reason I'm here. Is because I live in the Ghost Historic District at 3317 West 30th Avenue. And when we went up for historic designation about I guess it's been three or four years ago, I was the naysayer. I was against it. We weren't going to have an I did not want an HRA in this neighborhood that I had lived in for 30 some years. And so I made it known to everybody, of course, that I was against it. Well, it passed, and I'm no longer against it. It was a good thing that happened. And I don't know what happened, but I still have friends there. I don't know where the contentiousness was. Nobody seems to be that mad at me because of that at least. Could be other things. But. I think that those there will be a lot of people if this passes, which I hope it does, I think there will be a lot of people in hindsight that will say, you know what? It's not as bad as we thought it was going to be. And it hasn't been that bad. Thank you. Please vote for the historic district. Thank you, I think. Thank you, Ms.. You're welcome. Melissa Ortega. Hello. I'm Melissa Ortega, and I live at 3295 Mead Street. I am against this historic district. I am a Colorado native. I have grown up in North Denver and my entire. Life I have recently. Decided to move back and have purchased this home. Now you guys are trying to tell me that there is a possibility that I am going to have to keep my 100 square foot house that fits no family in today's standards. And I'm not going to be my type. I'm not going to be able to scrape. I have no options. And you guys are going to dictate that this historic district what if I wanted somebody to tell me what I could or couldn't do with my house? I will live in the suburbs. I moved to Highlands Ranch. I'd have in a way I don't want that. I want to do what I want with my house. I want to enjoy this neighborhood that I have seen grow tremendously over. The years. When it was low income to up and rising again. We have apartment buildings popping up off of 32nd. But you're telling me I can't put a simple pop top on my house to make my 800 square foot home built in 1926? Meet Today's Standards in my family. We're also talking I've heard several things tonight. It's like how many of you actually live in our district? How many of you have. Tried to repair. Your home recently? Have you seen the costs go up, the new construction? Everything that's plugging into our city is taking effect. And if we make this historic because nobody is going to be able to pay for it, I don't care what anybody has said tonight, it's like, show me the last time you have spent money and have tried to do this. I am in real estate. I have again grown up Denver my whole life like. Changes are happening. Denver re zoned for changes to happen and now rezoning has happened. Things are popping up. Things are being scraped and people want to stop that. You're trying to make me live in a house full of a specialist led. Based paint who knows other toxics. Because it was historic 100 years ago. It got built. Standards aren't the. Same. I just really wish that you guys would take into consideration the growing families that are trying to move into this neighborhood. If I can't do what I'm going want to do to my house, it will become a rental. And then nobody will be contributing to that neighborhood. And that's something you guys will force to happen. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. Ortega. Linda Hilton. Hello, I'm Linda Hilton, and I'm a property owner within the proposed district. I live at 3440 Osceola Street, and I'm the proud owner of a 1910 classic cottage, the one that has all the flowers. Around it for any of. You who went on our tour. I moved. I bought that house 23 years ago. But even back then, I felt that I was just and still. Feel that I'm the temporary caretaker of this. Historic home. My mom was really worried that I was buying an older home and it really has was still withstood the test of time. I agree with that. We really should. Spend our money not putting everything into the landfill and restoring these homes. I love the historic homes in my neighborhood. I mean, I'll be perfectly honest. I mean, I'm stand before you because I love these old homes and I want to keep them. I don't mind them being the tops being popped. And I've seen some really nice ones for those people who say, you can't be done, we can be. But I was going to speak on the historic women in our neighborhood that contributed so much to to Colorado and in Denver, but that was highlighted with. The staff presentation. So I won't go into that. I feel proud to live in a city that that will even let us have hearings like this that. Has a preservation group on the staff that that that allows. Us the time. And you to consider having these historic districts in in our city. I think that's what makes Denver great. And I would like to see our. Just little two. By four block neighborhood, you know, added to the to the wonderful historic preservation efforts that the city. Has so wonderfully spent their time. Making sure happen. So please, please vote for this. I want to also preserve my wonderful neighborhood. Thank you for listening to me. Thank you, Ms.. Hilton. Ileana Kreisky. Excuse keys. My wife. Oh, but she had to go. Oh. Are you signed up to speak? Are you signed up to speak? Okay. We're going to have to wait till I call on you, if that's okay. Thank you, sir. All right. Julianne Moore. She left. Okay. I'm going to call the next five mark. Matt Macaluso. Macaluso Sorry. Macaluso. Mark Macaluso. Jacquie Youngblood. Jeff Snell. Kick, Mason. Zoe. Zo'or. All right, Mark. You're up first 3 minutes. Hey. My name's Mark Macaluso. I live my property at 3400 Newton Street. I am opposed to the district. I. I purchased my property two years ago and I moved to the neighborhood based on the friendly, peaceful atmosphere and and the friendly people. The house was an old and dilapidated boardinghouse rundown. I proceeded to scrape the property and build a duplex on the property. I did. Throughout the process, I received a lot of positive feedback, tremendous support. Everybody was very, very nice. I feel like the end product was a very esthetically pleasing. It's modern. It's new. I, I sold half of the duplex to a couple who again are very keen. Speaking of contributing properties are very, very much a contributing member of members of our society. They pay taxes. They do very well. I think over the last you know, as you guys know in Denver, we've seen tremendous growth. We want good quality people coming to our place of neighborhood. I think what makes our our city great and our neighborhood great is the diversity among the people. I've met some of the pro historic people, and they're very nice people as well as are the people that are against it. I think what has been happening throughout this whole process is tremendous discord, discord and and contention. And it's sad to see that because our neighborhood is divided now. And that's not why I moved to the neighborhood. And it's it's sad that we've that we've let it come to this point. I feel like we can create a solution that satisfies everybody. We don't have to have that pendulum swing all the way from one side to the other. We can find a solution somewhere that makes everybody happy with design, guidelines, overlay, whatever it is. We just need to have that opportunity. I don't think we've had that opportunity through this process. It's been sort of shoved down us and now we've now you see the result. I think if you see all the people, again, it's it's it's almost it's almost the same right down the middle. So I think the proof is in that. So I don't think you can rubber stamp anything at this point because the people have spoken, the people have showed you that, you know, we were willing to work with it. There are good people on both sides of the aisle here. We just need to let that process play out. We don't need to rush this in. I can tell you that from my standpoint, it's not a quick process to develop and scrape a house. It's taken two years to do that so people aren't going to be rushing to the neighborhood as soon as this meeting is over to be developing. If you guys vote no, that's not going to happen. The House is here with don't warrant that. I can tell you from a development perspective, to buy one of these style houses is not prohibitive. Description. You're right. You're out of time. Thank you. Thank you. Jackie Youngblood. Thank you. My name is Jackie. I'm what? I live at 2975 Irving Street. I'm very much in support of this historic district. And thank you for the opportunity this week. I live in the nearby Ghost Historic District and I wanted to share some of my and my neighbors observations and experiences living in a historic district. I have lived there since 2000. And we became a historic district in August 2010. It has been a very positive experience. I would not want to live in any other area in Denver that is not designated a historic district. Historic districts are a win win for property owners. They allow us to welcome new development that complements and enhances the existing character. They are the best means available to ensure the old and new can co-exist harmoniously. Also, I found during our designation that even those neighbors who were concerned or even opposed when our district was created are now solidly in favor because they have seen the benefits of development that fits in and are able to expand, adapt and modernize their homes. As you know, state tax credits, credits of up to $50,000 are also available. For some projects. I also want to share what of what the Johnson family said that live in the wolf historic district. We feel that the benefits of living with the historic, historic district outweigh the drawbacks, in particular due to our own experience and working with the West Highlands Neighborhood Association Wina. We have recently gone through the design review process and we are pleased with the outcome in support of the Design and Preservation Committee. I particular project was met with some unique obstacles, but thanks to the witness support and guidance, we feel the project will create a home that will accommodate the needs of our growing family without diminishing the area's historic charm or adversely impacted our neighbors. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Michelle Black, Jeff Snell. Good evening. My name is Jeff Snell, and my wife and I live at 3339 Loeb Boulevard for 20 years and of August. I don't want to repeat myself either. We're all here to wait. I do want to bring up that one size doesn't fit all. We have one of the few triple lots in the neighborhood, and the house is roughly 1880. It's wood, one of the few. And still standing is kind of a miracle. But the foundation is brick. I can tell you that brick does not last forever. My brick is 130 years old, and I could crush it in my hand. It's. It's a problem that I realize in probably 15 years the House will have to go because the center of the house where the basement is, I couldn't really economically replace that brick. So I painstakingly replace the whole foundation around the stem walls of concrete. But it's it's a Band-Aid. Okay, so our house sits catty rumpus in the back of the lot. I think when we got done remodeling it six years worth of work, it turned out pretty good. But when the time comes, it's going to fall down. So when I bought it, it was our too. I could put a nice good sized duplex on it. It's probably going to be my retirement or my wife's. So with the restrictions that I'm hearing about that are coming my way. I tell you, I don't know how anyone can say I'm not going to lose money on this. My options are a lot more limited than they were before this. So I just ask you to vote no. There's got to be a better way. I'd love to get out of this. And there's some other folks that agree. So thanks. Yeah. Thank you, Miss Snell, Casey Mason. Good evening. Thank you for this opportunity to. Speak on behalf of historic designation for what I. Hope will become the Packard's Hill neighborhood. As a career journalist, I will. Follow the who, what. Why, how and when formula in my remarks. Who my name is Catherine, also known as Casey Mason and I have. Owned and lived in the duplex at 3300 Dash 3308. Newton, which is in the District since 1977, I believe I am one of the longest non. Absentee owners and the two block. Stretch of Newton between 33rd and 35th. What? I am here to encourage your vote for historic designation. I've been an active volunteer attending meetings, knocking on doors, emailing and visiting with people as they walk their children and or their dogs past my corner lot. And I would like to add that I have never experienced any of the hostility from anyone in all of this time. Why I was. Attracted to the neighborhood 40 years ago by its tree lined streets and the middle class mixture of brick bungalows, Tudors, Queen Anne Mansions and Denver squares. It reminded me of. Where I grew up in historic. Las Vegas, New Mexico. After spending seven years in the apartment complexes of. Glendale. Capitol. Hill and East Monaco, I found my sense of place in North Denver. It became home and remains so to this day. One of the first books I bought was Rediscovering Northwest Denver by Ruth Weisberg. Visitors frequently have to endure a presentation of my hood's early Denver history. The dot com boom of the 1990s brought in new owners who restored many homes that had. Been allowed to deteriorate. By absentee landlords. The 32nd straight commercial area morphed into several blocks of coffeehouses, trendy restaurants, boutiques and specialty shops. The old buildings were not destroyed. They were renovated to fit in with the character of the existing neighborhood. How I believe historic designation is the. Best way to bring stability to the place I call. Home. I do not believe it will prevent further improvements or development. In fact, statistics indicate property. Values go up because people are attracted to historic. Districts and are willing to invest in them. Several years ago, I sold a vacant. Lot at the north end of my property at lower than market price. Because the buyer. Slash contractor. Was willing to. Work with me on what got built. The result was a beautiful new. Craftsman bungalow that I'm told already meets the requirements of historic designation. When now is the time to act? I would like to close by. Relating a recent conversation I had with two girls, probably 10 to 12 years old, who saw a television news crew and asked me what was going on. I explained historic preservation to them and asked what they thought of their effort. Of our effort while they both live. Outside, just outside. The district. They each said they were glad they lived in homes. One with a big new addition set the space for them with the rest of the neighborhood. I wish I could have brought them to this meeting. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Thank you for your time. Zoe Zuber. Zucca are we miss the K there? Sorry, but that's okay. I blame my horrific handwriting. Okay, go ahead. Hi, I'm Zoe Zucker, live at 3278 Newton Street, which is in the proposed historic district. And Jean and I have been owners of that property for almost five months. We are some of the newest owners in the area, I think and I'm sorry, I don't have a speech prepared tonight. I hope you don't find that to be disrespectful at all. I certainly didn't mean it that way. I just wanted to be able to hear what my neighbors had to say, because a lot of what I've been hearing is actually a lot of talk about community. My mother wrote actually her dissertation on community. And I have to say, I'm a little bit disappointed in mine. My new community anyway. Nine. That's the total number of neighbors that I can recall in the past five months that have actually knocked on our door, introduced themselves. Tell us a little bit about the neighborhood. I had no idea that the neighborhood was going to start going, excuse me, historic until neighbor number seven knocked on my door and asked me to vote pro. I had no idea what that meant and I just went, Cool, thanks. Let me read the paperwork as I do with most things, so I never sign on the dotted line until I read everything through. Thanks, Dad. And then I started doing my homework. And what I found out was other friends of mine who actually do own properties in different historic districts around Denver have nothing but complaints, unfortunately, and many of them have vacated those properties and turn them into rentals. So not only are is the idea of community disintegrating before their eyes, they don't even want to live there anymore. Some of them have sold because they couldn't do anything to their house and the amount of effort and cost that went into just getting their proposal to a point where the architect or excuse me, the contractor could submit to get a permit, it was so overwhelming. And then to be turned down, the next thing you did was put the house on the market and they ended up losing money on the sale. If somebody had come to my door within the first five months of us living there and told me a bit more about the actual historic. Amazing, wonderful things that have. Happened within our neighborhood that may have changed my mind. If more than know, six neighbors have knocked on my door and wanted to introduce themselves. Me bring over a pie invited to a barbecue, something along those lines. I might believe that this has something to do with community, but unfortunately I don't. So yeah, my neighbors, if you have something you want me to change on my house or something you disagree with me doing. My door's open. Three, two, seven, eight. Newton Thanks. Thank you. Ms.. Zucker. Okay, I'm going to call the next five folks up there. We are at the halfway point. And so I think I think we've we've done pretty well. I just want to remind folks that now we've really heard from half of you. And so if there's some new information, please share. If not, you know, be considerate of your time. Laurie Simmons upfront. Jean all day. Michelle Meyer. Megan. Winger. And okay. Jarrett O'Hare. One, two, three. Or and let's do one more. Do we do winter? Yeah, we did winter. Sheila. Oh, Ranger, this is. But you didn't. Oh. Oh, yeah. Is Bo Ninja here? Okay. Hey, there we go. Okay. There we go. We are ready to go. Laurie Simmons. Hello. I'm Laurie Simmons. I'm a 30 year resident of Denver's Berkeley neighborhood. I'm also a historian and the coauthor of this landmark application. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you tonight in support of this historic district. As Denver historian Marsha Goldstein wrote 15 years ago, our city's historical record has often neglected women. Early histories recorded the story of men that overlooked early female, Denver writes. I would like to ask you one question. How many 19th century Denver women doctors can you name? Two lived in Packard Hill, Dr. Mary Ford and Dr. Helene Byington. Their house stands at 32. 25. Sorry, 38. 25. West 32nd Avenue. When I asked that question of you, maybe some of you thought of dirt doctor just, you know, Ford. She received her Colorado medical license in 1902. Well, Dr. Mary Ford moved to Denver and began began her practice in 1880. Ms.. Simmons put that mike down just a little bit. Some folks can't hear you. Okay? There's no better. Perfect. Okay. An African-American doctor just in his Ford's remarkable career was some in some ways similar to Dr. Mary Ford, who lived in Packard Hill. Both were known in their neighborhoods for treating thousands of patients during their time when there were few women doctors to be had in Denver. Dr. Mary Ford also operated a small sanatorium in her home and was quite active in activities to expand opportunities and rights for women. Dr. Mary Ford died in 1951 and Dr. Justino Ford in 1952. So why do we remember Dr. Justin Ford's name more than Dr. Mary Ford's name in 1982, when faced with redevelopment of the block where Dr. Justino Ford's house stood, local residents with the assistance of the developer and historic Denver were able to save the building, which is now part of the Curtis Park Historic District. It is known as the Black American West Museum today and is an important reminder of the life of Dr. Justinian Ford. I'm sure we've all had the experience of having a familiar landmark in our life, and then it goes away and we can't remember what was there. A few years ago, Dr. Mary Ford's house was threatened with demolition, which was avoided with the help of historic Denver. The current owner of the house is extremely supportive of this historic district application. Simmons I'm sorry. Your time is up. Oh. That was quick. Yeah, it goes it goes fast. Thank you. Thank you, Jean. All day. Jean all day. All right. Michelle Meyer. Good evening. Can you hear me okay? Yeah. Okay. Thank you guys so much for being here. I know it's a really long night and there's a lot of voices to be heard, but I just want to start off. By thanking you guys. My name is Michelle Meyer. I live at 3280 Osceola. And I am in support of this historic district. I can't tell you the number of times that my friends and family and I'm sure all of you, each of you has has visited our cute neighborhood and seen the charm that we all share and feel about it. So I live in a cute 1908 Craftsman style home, and in our neighborhood you can also find the Queen Anne Homes, which you just aren't seeing. Being. Built today. Anymore. And it's unfortunate and it's just such a special place. It's so fun to meet my neighbors and walk the dog and see the beautiful homes that we appreciate from that were built so long ago. And all my friends are visiting and they can just they come and they eat dinner. With me and they go out with me in the neighborhood. And it supports our economy. And also, it's been a very fun process, just learning about the history that Lawry's just shared with. Us and even my coworkers. She always talks about how her dad was part of the Italian mafia, which is interesting, but it's just fun to hear about that stuff. And I feel like the buildings and the residents that we all share. They're what grounds our. History and what. Keeps it alive today. And it's very special. And I urge you all to please keep that in mind and vote for the historic district. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Meyer. Megan Winger's not here. Right. Okay, great. Um, you're at O'Hare. Our. Hi. Good evening. Like a lot of folks in the room, I'm an import. I moved here. To say your name for. The record. Gerard O'Hare, 3416 Meat in the District. I also own the house next door, which is 3400 MEADE Both in the district. Like a lot of folks in the room, I moved here. My wife grew up in North Denver, went to North High School. So I'm well aware of the fact that there are more than just architectural changes going on on the north side. I suspect most people don't even call it the north side anymore, but I've been there since the early nineties. Bought a house in 91 on Main Street and. When I needed more room, I built a small extension on the back. When I needed even more room, I dug down. So there are six houses on my block. Five are small, pretty attractive brick Victorians. The sixth house which I bought. For my own preservation and my own protection is a relatively ugly 1960s yellow brick, one storey bungalow right next door. It breaks up the whole flow of the block. I bought that for obvious reasons. I bought that because I don't want another monster home beside me. And I know we don't want to talk about this stuff, but I don't. And I took steps to preserve my investment by building down and building back. My house looks the same now as it did the day it was built in 1910. And I won't sell that rental next door for a profit or. A loss until I know that it won't screw up my whole block. It won't block my neighbor's sunlight. Hi, Michelle. We're still neighbors, you know, so I've taken steps to preserve the neighborhood because it's not my job to change the neighborhood. I moved to the neighborhood, and I'm trying to fit in with what was there. Thanks. All right. Thank you, Mr. O'Hare. Bo, when you. My name is. Bonita. I live at 3300 an hour. About that. Oh, no problem. I live at 3300 Osceola Street. We bought the house 15 years ago. I'd like to just tell our story because this process has already had a direct effect on us before this has occurred. My my wife and I have been planning and designing our home the entire time we've lived in our property for the past two years. We've worked with architecture firms and engineers to put those plans in motion. So we've already spent a great deal of money. So our current plans of our our home would be disallowed by the landmark the landmark designation specifically because of the step backs the 15 foot step back. We plan to add a story to our home. Our home is a 1938 Tudor, has a small footprint which effectively reduces the square footage that we need for our family. So this whole process, since we are well long on the way with our design plans, we've had to fast track this thing to be on a timeline imposed upon us versus our own timelines of saving money for literally 15 years. So we did get the permit into the permit desk. So regardless of the outcome of this vote, we're building our house that we've dreamed upon. But I'm sharing my story because there's other families just like me that are not here to build monstrosities. They're simply trying to modify their home to best suit their needs and their design tastes. So I ask you to vote no on the Packard Hill. And lastly, I don't think this is should be a yes no decision. This is putting us all in an awkward position. There's got to be a better way to come together and make a compromise. So vote no. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Sheila Bee. Czapski. Czapski. Nice. Good evening. I'm going to read my own statement and then follow up with the statement of a neighbor who couldn't be here tonight. Hello. My name is Sheila Pilarski. I live at 3350 West 36th Avenue near the intersection of 36th and Julian, just two and a half blocks from the district. As a resident of Denver for 23 years and a homeowner in West Highland for the past 20 years, I support designation of Packard Hill as a historic district. If my home was within the proposed district, I would be just as enthusiastic about this effort. The charming, historic homes in the area were what compelled me to buy my home 20 years ago in West Highland. Over the years, I have seen too many charming old homes, classic bungalows, Denver squares, Tudors and Victorians, among them scraped and replaced by multifamily multi-story structures. Our city is growing rapidly, and I agree that densification needs to happen where appropriate, especially within the inner city core. But let's preserve the unique character of our outlying neighborhoods while we still can for future generations to enjoy. Please vote yes to establish the historic district for Packard Hill. A supporter of Packard Hill is teaching a class tonight and could not be here but asked that I read his comments. Dear Council members, my name is Phillip Joseph. I have lived at 33, 95, West 31st Avenue with my wife and three children for 14 years. As a resident of West Highland and the Ghost Historic District, I support designation of Packard Hill as a as an historic district. Originally, my wife and I opposed creation of the Ghost District because we felt it would stifle change in the neighborhood that we'd be living in a museum. That fear turned out to be unfounded. Shortly after the district was created, we did a major addition to our home to accommodate our growing family. We had no problem with the design review process, and being in the historic district did not add to the cost of the addition. In fact, we were able to find an architect and local contractor who because they were both sympathetic with our goals and familiar with building in a historic neighborhood like ours, they were able and willing to work with us in keeping costs down. In this way, designation of historic preservation status helped foster the growth of very local businesses. I'd like to reassure opponents of the Packers Hill area and members of the council that the Denver Landmark Preservation Commission seems prepared to balance change with preservation of Denver's special historic areas. Thank you for your consideration of this request and for your vote to establish the historic district. Thank you, Mrs. BoSox. Ski. All right, Tony. I'm going to call the next five up. Tony, Julian, Nellie, Phil Alonzo, Matt McLain, Joan Bolduc and Caroline Snell. Tony, you are up first. You have 6 minutes. Fantastic. President Brooks and council members, thank you for the opportunity to speak. My name is Tony Giuliano. I live at 3310 Newton Street in the proposed district. Friends, I'm here to speak in opposition to the Packard Hill historic district. First, I'd like to acknowledge there are fantastic people on both sides of this issue. Neighbors and friends, there is a danger that this will be divisive in our neighborhood. And I'd like to admonish each of us who have an opinion, either for or against, to remain committed to hospitality and to neighborly affection for one another. I'm opposed to the historic district for the following reasons. First, there's clearly not consensus. An agreement in our neighborhood. As you can see here tonight, there are many for and many against. Changing the status quo of our neighborhood should be done in cooperation with all sides of this discussion. At the last hearing I attended the Landmark Preservation Committee. It was surprising to me to hear that more than a few of the people who spoke in support of the district do not actually live within its boundaries. I don't know if I'm counting accurately, but it's at least 13 tonight. Second, there is evidence that historic districts can have an adverse impact on minority homeowners. My family is multiethnic and we moved to the neighborhood because of its rich ethnic history. As a sidebar here, it should not go unaddressed that during the rationale presented for this historic district, it was necessary for the presenter to mention a previous mayor's active engagement with the Ku Klux Klan. This is disturbing. Progressive cities like Minneapolis are renaming landmarks like Lake Calhoun based on the connection to systemic racism and white supremacy. Why would we allow our rationale for this district to include this clan member? One of the selling points from proponents is that this will increase property values. We've heard that multiple times. This has been shown over and over again to make it more difficult for lower and middle income families to stay in their homes. It will not. I will not make any assumptions about the intentions of anyone in favor of this, but will conclude that there is insufficient understanding of the impact on families and homeowners who those with more resources should be working to protect. If there is a possibility that this will accelerate the gentrification of the neighborhood, that should be thoroughly researched and thoroughly understood by this Council before taking any action. Our neighborhood needs more young families. If you read more, or if you remove or make more onerous the opportunity for a growing family to add space to their home. These families will be less likely to live here, as you've heard several say tonight. Fourth, I love the historic architecture neighborhood in my home while built in 27 is a classic looking home. So thank you to Casey Mason, who made sure that was the case. I also appreciate progress and the diversity of taste and opinion about what makes a home beautiful. This historic district may may well impede progress and diversity. Those in favor of said that infill construction will still happen. But at public hearing, I asked specifically if a contributing home could be demolished, if it was in extreme disrepair and was told no. If 82% of the neighborhood is contributing, this will essentially end infill development in our neighborhood. Finally, the historic district will create financial harm for some and cause highest and best use to be ignored. For example, I purchased a home in the neighborhood that would be considered contributing. It has substantial issues that would make it a much better candidate for a scrape where a high quality home could be built that was suitable for a family. If this passes tonight. They will remove the option for me and require me to either sell the home now likely at a discount based on this, or to invest substantial personal resources to renovate a home that should not be renovated. It has no actual historical value other than the fact that it is old. I would ask this Council to, in light of the strong opposition and lack of neighborhood consensus, to reject this proposal. It's unsettling that there are so many here speaking for this that aren't impacted by it. I would also ask the Council to provide meaningful leadership and bring organizers on both sides of this issue together to work toward another resolution that takes into account the needs and desires of all in our neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Giuliani. All right, feel Alonzo. All right. Matt Mulally. Molly. Yes. There you go. Sorry about that. Hi. My name is Matt McClain. I live at. 3270 Mead Street in the proposed historic. District. And may I ask that of all who were here that oppose the Packard Hill historic district to stand up so they may see the numbers in opposition. Thank you. My wife and I oppose the proposed historic district. The historic landmark guidelines create another layer of bureaucracy, creates more hurdles and adds time and money to exterior modification projects. These guidelines severely limit what single story homeowners can do to modify their homes by requiring homes to maintain the front 15 feet. The streetscape is maintained only if the onlooker cannot see beyond that front 15 feet. The guidelines create bad architecture for those who want to pop the top of a single storey structure. They also force single storey structures to use more of their already small yards to get the same square foot footage as if they were allowed to use the front 15 feet of their house in that pop up. Unfortunately, the historic application process has created division in our neighborhood that wasn't there before. My wife and I just want to live in an area that homeowners homeowners can do what they want with their property architecturally and within current city zoning guidelines without someone else telling them what it should look like. Thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you, Mr. McLain. John Bolduc. Hello. My name is Joan Bolder. And once you prove it in West Highlands District one and I've lived at 3033 Yates for 32 years. I very much support this historic district, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak. I was going to talk about the women involved in this period of significance, but Laura or Lori already talked a little bit about it, and Kara talked about it, too. There are artists. There are writers. There's actors, actresses. Community involvement people. Some pretty gutsy women. And I just would like to make the point that Packard Hill still has gutsy women on both sides, and you guys are witnessing that. But one of the things I really wanted to make is everybody seems to think that, you know, a historic district, you know, if it's a mansion of a lumber baron or, you know, a mining tycoon, that that's worthy of saving. But that only tells part of the city's story. Packard Hills talks about the working class and the middle class of a trolley neighborhood. And that's a part of the story that our historic districts kind of sometimes don't really look at. So I want to make that important point, and I urge you to vote yes for the historic district. Thank you, Mr. Product. Caroline Snowe. My name is Carolyn Snell, and I live at 3339 Lowell Boulevard with my husband Jeff. And we happen to live in a home that is considered non contributing even though it was circa 1880. And so we would not have the benefit of the tax credits if we wanted to make improvements to our home. So that is totally unfair and. I've been very engaged in this process since I learned about it in May of 2015 when I was reading the West Highland Neighborhood Association minutes of the Design and Preservation Committee, and learned at that point that they had already been discussing this and working on this for 18 months, but never had the courtesy to leave us a note to try to reach us by phone or email, anything to ask anyone that I know our opinion or for our input, including the name of the district which I intensely dislike. So you would think they would at least have the courtesy to let us choose our own name if they're going to force this on us. So I have that has been bothering me since 2015, and I tried to stay open minded about it, even though I was upset from the very beginning that nobody had the courtesy to discuss this with us. So I went to all of the meetings which were not meetings. They were presentations that were where questions and answers were very managed. We had to write our questions on index cards and someone would rifle through them and choose which questions would be asked and answered. It was not a forum. It was not a meeting. It was a presentation. So I even decided to go on one of their walking tours and at that point was so engaged that and trying to keep an open mind that one of the co-chairs of the Design and Preservation Committee even asked if my husband and I would host the reception following the walking tour. So I really did try to keep an open mind about this the whole time. But where they last me on this walking tour. What's when we walk by to old. Basically brick square little boxes that would be like living in a pizza oven in the summertime. Their only historical significance was that they were built by World War Two veterans returning after the war. And I just feel like this is a farce that they're picking and choosing these obscure historical details. And I. Think there would be a lot better. Ways to honor our veterans than these. Two little houses, that it would be an improvement to replace them with something bigger and more energy efficient that families could grow up in. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you, Ms.. Snell. Okay, Stephanie. Okay, well, we got a whole new group. That's right. Here we go. You all can be seated. Stephanie Burke. Awesome. Your first step. Jessica Alasdair is next. Stephanie Gold Hammer. Nick Bertrand and Fran Trujillo. Stephanie. 3 minutes. We'll see if this works. Hi. My name is Stephanie Bourg Oram. I am a resident and property owner at 3230 Newton Street in the proposed district. And I support designating Packard's Hill a historic district. I've lived here for over 27 years now. I actually married into the neighborhood, and I have to admit that his Queen and Painted Lady was a positive attribute in in my now husband. Historically, Packard Hill is a working and middle class neighborhood with a high number of. Houses that have been owned by women. People move here because they like the character of the place. The pleasing appearance, as well as the nice neighbors. There's a very high historic integrity, which is what really appeals to me. 82% are contributing structures. That display Denver's. Architectural evolution from 1890 to 1940. It's quite a variety of styles. Queen Anne's Classic. Cottages, Bungalows, Denver Squares, terraces. A few others. Some are. A few are fairly ornate. Especially those built before the Silver Panic of. 1893. Later ones are rather more modest. There is a variety of sizes one story all the way up to substantial to two and a half stories. There are narrow lots or extended lots or even doubles. 16 are. Duplexes. One's a triplex. Most are single family. Most of them are brick. And the high quality of workmanship really. Promises them to endure as well. There are exceptions, but mostly they endure. Yes, they are middle class and worth preserving for that very reason. The high degree. Of integrity is a special and almost unique aspect of the neighborhood. That's hard to find today. In Denver. And very easy to lose in the growth that we are currently seeing. Our intact 100 year old neighborhood and its history deserve keeping the middle class. People who built Denver are worth honoring. As are the women who found. Their opportunity here. I hope you find. Our area worthy of designation under. The Denver landmark criteria. I urge you. To help us preserve this special part of Denver. Please vote yes to make. Packard's Hill a historic district. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you. All right, Jessica, let's. Good evening. Members of Council Jessica. Leads at a Fairfield in Woods. 1801 California, Suite 2600 on behalf of Keep West Highlands Free. I'd like to begin just by committing to the record the. Biased nature of the the landmark process. Your staff. Works very hard to. Review applications against the the criteria as it sits within your. Code, but your. Code is broken. And it. Consistently and this is not my first time for you results. In the city. Advocating. For one neighbor against another, and it's never been clearer than it is. Here this evening. It overlooks also the powerful. Filter. That landmark plays in the information that you. Receive. So there are a number of letters that, for. Whatever reason, have been emitted consistently through the record. I believe along the process, many of you have received them. They have not made their way into the record. And this is significant. Because Section. 30 Dash four of your code requires that due consideration. Shall be given to the written views. Of affected properties. So in designating. An entire swath of. Homes against the will of over 75 homeowners. Think about that. That is 75 gyms. Those are 75. Judith Batiste's 75. If you were. To solely apply the criteria this we'd. Be over. At Landmark. We'd be done. But you are called on. To consider the totality of the public. Impacts and what this. Policy means for our city when we pit neighbor against neighbor. You all work very hard with your constituents to navigate very contentious issues on a daily basis. I know that historic districts should not be one of them and not at this point in the process. I sat here the night that your Virginia village, 95% of the homeowners in Virginia Village supported that historic designation by the district. By the time it got to you, there was a lot of work that was done first. So there are many options and those options. Maintain the character of the neighborhood. But they've been dismissed very early on in this process, and we would urge you to let the neighbors go back and work through those options. Lastly, there have been mentions about Supreme Court cases. And the Supreme Court also found in Keeler. Versus the city of New London that eminent domain of 14 homes. And giving that property. To the municipality was also legal. But that doesn't mean that's the right policy for Denver. So I urge you to vote no. Thank you very. Much. Thank you. All right. Stephanie Goldhammer. Hello. My name is Stephanie Goldhammer and I live at West Highlands Neighborhood at 3027 Gage Street. I'm a real estate broker with Remax Alliance, and I had been in the real estate industry since 2001. I am here to support the Packers Hill Historic District. I would like to clarify one misperception that you have already heard and we'll probably hear again tonight, and that is the claim, the false claim that property values will decrease if the historic district is approved. Statistically, if you look at the data for the sold properties in the two historic districts already in existence in the West Highlands neighborhood, the Allen and Ghost and the Wolf Place historic districts, the numbers show that the average sale price per square foot for properties within the historic districts are higher than those homes adjacent to these districts. Homes in the ghost districts sold an average of 409 per square foot, compared with homes outside the district that sold at four four per square foot homes in the Wolf Place, sold at 405 per square foot with the surrounding homes outside that district sold for 398 per square foot. Numbers don't lie. Prices within historic districts tend to be. Slightly higher than in adjacent areas. These findings are consistent with previous local comparisons, as well as local and national research. This suggests that while property values won't dramatically increase, creating the historic district will at least stabilize property values and certainly will not. Decrease. Values. Thank you for your time and your support. Thank you, Goldhammer. Nick Bertrand. I am Nick Bertrand, and I'm in the zone at 3290 Mead Street. I originally signed the proposal to make the neighborhood historic. However, I have changed my mind for many reasons described today. Once this is approved, there's no going back. We're stuck with what's here. I'm also shocked that there's 14 people that are for. A. Peruvian historic district that have spoke today that don't even live in the district. Several years ago. Seven years ago. Exact, I guess we purchased our home and I'm sorry, I'm going to try to be quick and I'd rather just talk instead of reading this. You know, we purchased our home seven years ago. We had no children. Home was awesome. Looking back at some photos, it was awesome. There's no clutter, there's no toys. There's so much room. And like many people on this side of the room that I swear are not Chiefs fans, are really Broncos fans. Honestly, it's one of those things where the neighborhood just drove us to the neighborhood. We looked at 32nd Street. I don't think the neighborhood of the actual homes is quite what did it. It was the actual people. It was the stores. It was the atmosphere. You know, it's something over the last couple of years after having a child, you realize that there is so much stuff. And unfortunately, a lot of these homes that we're talking about today don't have the amenities that we need today. Over the last couple of years, we've looked at possibly moving out of the city. And honestly, we don't want to. We love our neighbors. Chris, who likes to have the 5:00 drink on Friday and Saturday, who is for it? It's something where we want to stay neighbors with Chris. But the way our lot is designed, we can't go straight back. Denver has unique property lines that really do get impacted by this, and it's not just clear cut thinking that you can just do an easy remodel and it'll be good to go. I just there's so much that just goes through my mind on this. And honestly, I just. We own the home. It's it's. I feel like someone's taken away something that we've worked hard for. So I urge you to vote no. Thank you, Mr. Bertrand. All right, friend. Friend Thornhill? Yes. My name is Fran Trujillo. I live at 3249 West Fairview Place. I'm about two blocks from the district. I'd like to encourage your positive vote for the Packard's Hill Historic District. I'm not only a resident of the West Highlands. I also live in a has a property with historic designation. I'm here because. Being connected to Denver's rich history. Mattered to me as. A homeowner. I've had some experience with historic designation, and I absolutely know that it does not. Present difficult hurdles for homeowners, but generous and appropriate supports. Owning a property in a district like this is a privilege. It also does not encumber homeowners with difficult red tape or rules which. In any way deny. A property owner their rights. Yes, it will help to preserve the culture and esthetic. Of the neighborhood. But it doesn't keep anyone from appropriately updating and remodeling home. Really good architects and builders are generally well informed. And open to using creativity and skill to. Honor a historic district's needs. This is an important district for many reasons, and it should be protected as a part of Denver's amazing history. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Mr. Hill. All right, next five. Alex La Flor, Mary. Margaret Johnson. Thomas. Fletch. Uh. PLO gigolo. Paolo. Alex. Oleg. Boy. One, two, three, four. All right, Alex, you're up first. The floor. Alex La Flor. Okay. Uh, Mary Margaret Johnson. Good evening. My name is Mary Margaret Johnson. I own my home in the proposed district at 3278 Mead Street over there for 27 years now. I thought I'd share with you a little bit about what I learned when I did the history of my house. Like the neighbor who spoke quite a bit earlier when I pulled that building permit, there was a woman's name on it. Her name is Mrs. Stevens, and she lived across the street. She built not only my house, her house, but several houses in the area. In fact, by 1907, she had hung out her shingle as a contractor in the. City directory of Denver. As I researched the historic archives in the newspaper databases I saw as she bought homes. Built homes, sold properties in Packard's hill and the wider Highlands area, and eventually down here in the capital area. So women were building homes, different women were building all kinds of homes in the area. It's an interesting thing. And as the Rocky Mountain News reported, they were a large proportion of homeowners in the whole highlands area and a force to contend with, as many have mentioned earlier. But really in their architectural choices, the women of Packard's hill, if you think about it, they were literally shaping the visual character of this new subdivision, the same character that has attracted so many buyers over the decades. You know, I won't say a whole lot more because you've heard so many great stories about the folks in this area. But I will say that I was talking with my daughter this afternoon. And she said to me about this whole thing. So, yeah, what these women were doing was reflecting what was going on historically in this city at the time. In this state at this time. But more importantly, what it was doing was showing that the experiment was working. I thank you for your consideration this evening and urge you to vote in support of the historic district. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Johnson. Uh. Okay. Thomas felt. Hello. I'm Thomas Felch. I live in the District 3359 Osceola Street at a tall greenhouse about halfway down in this area between 32nd or third and 35th. I see a bunch of people over here that I hope I'm still invited to the October Fast Party next weekend. I, I love this neighborhood. My wife and I moved here into the Highlands in the Ghost District about seven years ago and quickly outgrew when our first child came in, our second one was on the way. So we decided to look in the neighborhood for a property who and a real estate agent here also sold us that property. And, you know, we we love it. We bought it because we felt like we could expand again based on the way that our house is. And I think somebody tonight said earlier, maybe, Nick, we can't go straight back, we can't fit into the guidelines in order to actually have a house that we want to grow our family and and live here for the next 50 years, like many people have done. And that bothers us is it's restrictive. We feel it's restrictive on our rights. And I'm all for honoring doctors and women who build this neighborhood. That's incredible. But let's put up a statue for them. Let's let's do something that doesn't feel like we're taking away half of this room's rights to do what they want with their property. You know. We were pretty fortunate to find the property that we did. We have incredible neighbors and we get a great opportunity to sit out on the front porch or on the back porch in the backyard and have cocktails and talk about this stuff. And I think it's great. I mean, some of my neighbors from the Ghost District are here to speak in our position because of what they went through. And that's real to us. It's money. It's 2 to 3 times as expensive for us to do what we want to do with our house. Then what we want to do with our house. And our house is a prime example of one that was re completely redone about three or four years ago. On the inside and on the outside. It's great, but it's tiny. By today's standards, it's 1800 square feet. And when you have all those toys and you're slipping on them, you're falling down the stairs because there's no place to put your kids. There's no place for guests to come visit. There's no place to have a bathroom that has a shower. So your mom or your dad who are in a wheelchair coming to visit, they can't stay with you. It's it's hurtful. It really kind of it hits us pretty hard and it makes us have to consider. Moving out of the city. And we don't want to do that because we love the neighborhood. We love the people that we like cornhole with and and be every now and then and and have cocktails on the porch with and talk about everything we want to talk about. So thank you. We'd like to on behalf of my wife and my son, my daughter, my dog, Sam, and many of you in this neighborhood know pretty well. We'd like to strongly urge the council to vote no and come to a conclusion and a compromise about something that works for everybody in the room. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Felch. Paula. Paula, I think about. That. I'll say my. Name. Yeah. Yeah, once you do that. Good evening. My name is Paola Jolo and I live in the district with my husband Chris, the Buffalo Bill guy. We live at 30 to 86 Main Street and we were in our house for 17 years. I am strongly in support of the Story District and I agree with everything that everybody of my neighbors have said in favor for it. I'd like to actually use my time to read. A statement for somebody who cannot. Be here tonight. So, dear council members, my name is Jennifer Abel. I'm the owner of Nostalgic Homes Highland's original real estate firm, proudly located in the proposed Packard Hill Historic District at 32nd and Newton Street for more than 30 years. I'm pleased to write in support of the proposed Packer Hill Historic District when only very few people appreciated the true value of the fine historic home in this area nostalgic homestead. Through the years, we were able to introduce new homeowners to this vintage neighborhood and be part of the flourishing, thriving neighborhood. Families choose to stay in the city. Businesses have prospered, and I'm proud that our efforts helped to stabilize and transform a part of the city that desperately needed attention to homes and businesses. Today, it is highly sought after in my 22 years of experience and as a realtor, I know buyers want stability in their neighborhood historic designation support stable, attractive neighborhoods, and some buyers seek out a storied history for their reason. They do not compromise ownership and abilities. In fact, by comparison, housing prices and historic districts in adjacent areas show only slightly higher prices in historic districts. Slightly higher prices in these historic districts often goes hand-in-hand with the fact that historic district often house neighborhood jewels. In reading the Packers SEAL nomination, it was interesting to see the role women professionals and civic activists have had in West Highland and in the city of Denver. Unusual for that period in history. In Denver, many women in Packer held own their own homes, and many women were involved in serving their communities in important roles such as doctors, business owners, teachers and the like. True contributors to the neighborhood. My own grandparents were part of this contribution. Beckett Hill as made a significant contribution to Denver's history. Even as we enjoy a development surge, we all need to do all that we can to preserve our irreplaceable, historic homes and neighborhoods. I encourage you and respectfully put a plea before you to act on September 25th to designate packed or Denver's newest historic district in Denver's popular West Highlands neighborhood, respectively, submitted. Jennifer Able, broker, owner, realtor, nostalgic homes. Thank you so much for your consideration. Please vote yes. Thank you, Mr. YOLO. Alex Olick. Good evening. My name is Alex Olic and together with my wife, we live at 3625 West 30th Avenue since 1994. In the interest of time, I'd like to echo what most people on the opposition have said. I know that we are friends of both sides and I hope to be friends with everybody still after this. But we live in a historic district, and I know that some of my neighbors in the district have had a lot of issues with the district when they were doing work on their homes. So I urge you to vote no. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Mr. Olek. Okay. We have the next five Mary scones. Pam Pollan. Sherrie Moore. Violet Baker. Jerry Mullen. Violet Baker is not here, I hear. William Baker. Okay, Hubby. I hope you stay up late. Okay. Mary Stone zero four SCHOEN. Yes, yes. Good evening. My name is Mary Jones and I live at 3326 Mead Street, which is in the district. While searching for a home to purchase in 2003. I looked at many different Denver areas, but I was repeatedly drawn back to the Highlands neighborhood where I eventually found my dream home. Prior to the recent formal study of the Packard Hill area, I had done my own research to look into my home in the area and learned of the homes that were owned, built and occupied by a variety of women, including women of his historic significance. Now, I'm not claiming that I am a woman of historic significance, but I am happy to carry on this tradition of ownership as an independent, professional woman who has worked in public schools for almost 30 years now in the Denver area. My Queen Anne Cottage was built in 1890, and although it has gone through many transformations over the years, each transformation by each owner preserved the historic Victorian features of the home. I also purchased my home with the intention of nurturing the historic character of both the structure itself and the surrounding gardens, which at this point contains a small pond. When I when the historic district was first proposed, I initially had many questions and concerns, including questions about my home, which is built of sand brick and has a dirt foundation. I think there's a few of those. I also have a crumbling sand brick garage that was probably originally built for a horse or a carriage. So my questions were very important to me. But as I went through the process and went to the meetings and had my questions answered, I was convinced that this was the right move for our neighborhood to preserve not only the history, but the significance of our neighborhood. I'm here tonight to share with you my love of our special neighborhood and to express my support of the establishment of the Packard Hill Historic District. I ask for your support as well by your vote to approve our application. Thank you. Thank you. Ms.. Jones. Pam Pullen. It's actually Matt and Pam Bullard should be Matt and they're. Oh, okay. We'll let it go. Go ahead. From the police, we know Law Boulevard. Okay, so it's right across the street from the ghost and across. The street from this proposal for the Packard. Basically, I've lost some friends, some families that were in the ghost place area due to their growing family size and inability to do remodels that are less than. High price. I think I'm the only one here in this building right now that has gone through historic district actual proposals. I presented to the board to get my proposal finished, to get my designs put through. I don't think anybody else is here that is proposed to the council. Anyone? So the only one here that's actually gone through that actual districting and that. Actual proposal process. I've spent an extra $26,000 in architect fees alone. From my first proposal to the board of. Nine. To the actual historic district to the final approval of my plans was one year and one week. Think about that. One year and one week mid construction. For my process to get finished. For approval to finalize my actual permits. The second home I had rent to live in that time. The actual additional cost to construction is exponentially more than that. 26,000. Based on my construction, I was doing interior remodel only the interior. I didn't need historic approval. Unfortunately, during that process, it exposed major structural issues that had to be resolved according to code enforcement. Changed the roofline in the front portion of that building had to be changed. Whether that's supporting the roof structure, which would then reduce the ceiling height, which by code is also not allowed. Caused me to have to change the front. 15 foot of my of my whole. During this process. Staff at Historic suggested I return my two story home back in a one story home. A lot of these things are kind of unacceptable for, I think, most people going through a construction process, planning on living in their home as they do a small remodel. Unfortunately, the actual implications of this district impacts greatly to the people that are living in this district and do want to. Grow their home with their growing family. Please vote no. For my friends sakes, that now live in this proposed district across the street from me, that I've moved from Ghost Place into Packard Hill to allow this kind of construction in their homes to continue. They want to stay in this district. They want to stay in the Highlands, just like I do. And putting this proposal forward will probably push those young families out of these neighborhoods. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Potter. All right, Sherry. Thank you. Sherry Moore. Hi. My name is Sherry More. I live at 3319 mead and I'm in the district and I just would encourage you to vote for Packard Hill. Thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Moore. Violet Baker. Oh, well, if you're William Baker. I'm William Baker. Can you. I'm sorry. I'm going to get to you a year or two away. I'm sorry. I'm going to get to you in just a second there. This is your your wife. So no. Ileana Fresca is my wife. Violet Baker is my daughter. Okay. But your thought you called me up to take her place. No, no, no. I'm going to give. If Violet Baker's not here, you're into people. I'm going to get to you. Sorry about that. Got a whole family out here testifying. Okay, Violet Baker's not here. You can take her off. Jerry. Marlene. Great. And then, William, you're up next. My name is Jerry Marlene. I'm a property owner in the Ghost Historic District. We were 30th and Irving Street. I very much support this historic district. I love our history. I'd like to talk about the Denver mares that are associated with Packers Hill. Well, no. Mayor actually lived in Packard Hill while they served as mayor. There were three who either lived in the district before they served as mayor or own property in the area in addition to the three mayor mayors. There's also Alderman John Ah Thurston of the Town of Highlands, who lived in the district not only while he served, but also during his mayoral campaign. The fact. In fact, his opponent in that race lived right next door. I'm sure that was interesting. Robert Mayor Robert Speer owned property in the Packard Hill, but he never lived there. There was Mayor William Mills, who took over from Mayor Speer when he died, had lived next door to the alderman of the town of Highlands and was in fact his opponent in that race. Mayor Mills, who lived at 3825 West 32nd Avenue, went on to become manager of improvements and perks in Denver. Mayor Mills is credited with civic improvements in Denver, including the completion of the Civic Center. Benjamin Stapleton. Lived in several homes in Packard's Packard Hill between 1911 and 1920 before he became mayor. He held the office of Denver Police Magistrate from 1904 to 1915. He was then appointed by Woodrow Wilson. Two Denver postmaster in 1915, at the same time that Wilson appointed several other KKK members to other federal government positions in his move to segregate the federal government. We do not celebrate Stapleton's appalling connection to the KKK. But we must take note of this part of our history, or we may be doomed to repeat it. We instead celebrate the many other people, notable men and women who lived in Packard's hill and contributed so greatly to the development of Denver. I urge you to please help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration. Thank you, Mr. Miller. All right, Jim Baker. Good evening, 22 figured out. I'm William Baker. I'm from Park Hill and I'm speaking in opposition to the historic designation. I think I bring three things here I am three things that other people in this audience are not. So I can bring some different perspectives. First off, I'm a builder. I've spent my entire career of over 35 years restoring, repairing and improving and in character, old homes, exclusively old homes. I don't do anything new in the 1930. I started in the East Coast doing houses that were a pretty American revolution. And now I'm here. I do this because I love old homes. And yet I speak against this designation. I will come back to this. I'm also the owner of a 1908 house in Park Hill. I popped the top. We had a historic designation brouhaha there, and all the people who were in favor of the designation agreed that this was a truly excellent project and they thought it very attractive and they all agreed that under a historic designation it would not have been allowed. So I'm very grateful that I was able to do it before the designation was considered. As a resident of Park Hill, we went through the same process recently. It's actually still ongoing in a certain way. I heard I had the benefit of a year's time to study all about historic designation and read statistics from around the country and various articles that added to my knowledge as a builder. I heard the same misinformation that we have heard tonight. Both sides provide a certain amount of misinformation, but. I heard about the minimum cost of this of doing this project, the ease of the process, the improved property values. And I'm afraid numbers do lie. I can tell you later if I have the time. The truth of the matter is, it's very hit and miss. It depends on what neighborhood you live in, what the demographics are, what the socioeconomic levels are, how impoverished the neighborhood is, what state you're in. Many, many things. Historic designation does help certain neighborhoods, typically ones that are decrepit and impoverished and low value, which Packard Hill is not. That is why Historic Designation was originally set up. Whether your house is specific, how impacted it is by this designation depends on so many factors, what style it is, whether your roof line is perpendicular or parallel to the street, how big your lot is. Do you have the possibility of an addition? How high is your ridge line? Are you on a corner lot, etc.? So some people will have a fairly easy time and some people will be turned down outright for the project they want to do. When this problem. Comes to Mr. Baker. Your time is up. Yeah. I was halfway through it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, next five. Bob McCormick. Ron Johnson. Pat Devore, the FE. Uh, Chris. Uh. The. And Roger Oram. You can help me out, Chris, when you get up here. Bob McCormack, you are first. Thank you. My name's. Bob McCormick and. Other 3319 Meade Street, which is in the proposed zone. Just a couple of things. Most people have mentioned everything that I probably would have to say. Let's go back to that comment about looking into the future that and I have a quick story on that. When I, too, was an elected official at one point and said on that side of this and participated in a in a very controversial, historic district, and I was sort of opposed to it. I wasn't actually living in it. I was one block away. And I can just tell you that 40 years later, I went back into my old neighborhood and we were one block off of the historic district. My lack of support was a mistake. The street that I grew up, my children on, it's a. Architecturally disagreeable, I would say. And I know that personal experience is a little limited to go by, but that's my personal experience. Regarding the divisiveness somebody talked about, we were caretakers for our homes that she feels privileged to be a caretaker for. Whereas I like to say that we're you know, even though we're coming at this from different angles, collectively, we're caretakers of the community. We those of us who are in favor of the Packard Hill designation, are doing what we think is proper for being a caretaker for a community. And I'm sure this side does, too. And I'm here, I support it. And I and I also support, you know, my neighbors. We have a wonderful community in regarding the divisiveness. And many of, you know, me and I spend an awful lot of time sitting in a front porch. Next Sunday. We're having an Octoberfest in whatever side of this. Issue you sit on. You're more than. Welcome to join us. You know, I think the divisiveness is we do have different approaches, but I think. Our hearts are in the same place. We care about our community. And however you turn this out this evening, I think the community will pull back together again. I don't think it's a terminal illness that we suffer for going through this process. But I appreciate your time. I know it's late. I'm done. Thank you. Next up, Ron Johnson. My name is Ron Johnson. I've lived in the neighborhood for 30 years. Uh, I think this poor neighborhood is being loved to death by both sides. It appealed to me when I first came in the neighborhood because of its diversity in architecture and the background of the people that live there. It offered people that moved into the neighborhood a chance to improve their lives. It was a neighborhood in transition from older people to younger people with beginning their families. And because of that, people could move in there with their dreams to build a house that they wanted to raise their family. And if it involved adding a room, popping the top or keeping it as it was, it gave them a chance to live their dream. This proposition takes that dream out of their hands. And I don't want to see that happen. I think we're here tonight to persuade you, not persuade each other, that whatever you vote is going to have an effect on one side or the other. If you vote for the historic designation, it's going to hurt some people that came in here with some dreams. It's going to hurt your opportunities to turn those properties over when they get ready to retire or move or whatever is done. If you vote to oppose it, these people that are supporting it will be disappointed. But I don't think they'll be hurt as far as property values. In 30 years, I've seen property values in this area just skyrocket. I think many of us here probably could not afford to buy our own homes right now. So I don't think adding property value as an issue for historic designation is a good incentive. I think the thing to do is to keep the neighborhood vibrant, diverse, alive. It's not stagnant, it's not dead. It doesn't need to be hung on a wall and preserved. So please vote no on this. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Pat Duffy. Very good. My name is Pat Duffy and good evening, council members. I reside at 2979 Raleigh Street, about five blocks away from the proposed Packard Hill historic district. I've lived in this home in West Highlands for nearly 30 years, and before that, seven years north of the old Ilitch Gardens. It used to be in our neighborhood, in the Berkeley neighborhood. My husband and I have been very active members of the West Highland Neighborhood Association for over 27 years, and we've also been active in surveying four just discovered Denver for the last couple of years. I hope you remember in my brown book, Rediscovering Northwest Denver by Ruth Weaver. That I've used in testimony several times before. I want to share an excerpt from this book about why we love our northwest Denver neighborhood in Highlands. Homebuilding have been spotty, with some estates occupying a whole block, other blocks fully built up and nearby ones vacant as they filled this section of town, became a good example of the types of middle class architecture in Denver during the 1880s and nineties. Some developers had built rows of five or six Victorian one story or sometimes two story homes. Houses in a block and left the rest vacant. Those these first were built on the narrow 25 foot lots allotted at that time. Later, there were rows of Denver squares of one story neo classic of the so-called Anglo Bengal bungalows with wide front porches which were built in the 1920s. Just before World War Two. The preferred style was English, Tudor, large or small. After the war, building was rapid and city lot size ranch houses were built. I haven't seen many of those, but then suddenly there were very few lots left on which to build in this part of northwest Denver became static in just the last few years. So this would have been. She wrote this book in the seventies, mid seventies. In just the last few years, Highlands has been rediscovered as the last bit of early Denver, with a great many and deteriorated homes. Young couples are buying houses to restore them to their Victorian glory, to go along with those that have been kept in good condition by loving families. That early pride of Highlanders has never died. The people are still proud of their homes, their gardens, their trees, their churches, their schools. They are proud of their pure cold water, which they swear is colder than that in any other part of Denver. They are proud of their pure air. Perhaps not so unsullied as as at one time, but above most of the city's smog, so that they still have their treasured view of the towering blue and white sentinels of the Rockies and with a man in the of the 1890s. They can look down from their happy homes on the Eminence, where Highlands proudly sits upon the smoky city below. Once again, these yellowed tabs in this book are historic homes that were written up in this book that we have lost. And so we're hoping that Packard Hill is approved and that we don't have more yellow tabs that I have to mark in my book. Please approve this historic district. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Fame. Chris. The. Hello. My name is Chris Vassiliadis. My wife and I live at 3439 Isola in the proposed district and we are here. I am here in favor. She can't be with our seven month old, but in favor of the proposed district. Two things. Maybe add a little bit of color of things that haven't been said. I think of historic, historic designation as being something bigger than us and outside of our own self-interests. And that's why I support this area. I can talk about all the reasons why I love living here, but I don't trust that if a property we see properties turn over in our neighborhood pretty frequently. And I don't trust that with 1 to 3 turnovers of a property that 100 years of history can't be wiped out by one decision. So I think everybody here loves our neighborhood and wants to see it remain somewhat the same, the things that we love about it, I think some of us just want to ensure that. And then secondly, the thing I love, one of the things I love about the neighborhood is riding my bike into downtown, to my job, and I get to ride through some beautiful neighborhoods and architecture. Potter Highlands is a historic district that I ride through every day, and in the last two years that I've lived here, I've seen a number of a number of approved modifications to the architecture that give me a sense of freedom that if we do want to modify our home, that that it is reasonable process to go through, but maintaining the character of the neighborhood that we love. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Roger. Are. Q Thank you. Thank you all. I am Roger or I'm a native North Denver, eight and nearly 39. Your property owner and resident at 3230 Newton Street in the proposed district where my wife Stephanie also lives, we could have moved elsewhere, but chose to remain in this historic and beautiful neighborhood. I very much support the proposed Packard's Hill historic district. I had other remarks that aren't of much consequence at this moment because they've already been mentioned several times. But there's a couple of things I guess I would like to say. Is that our area is on the front line of development. And there is no doubt about that. And things aren't going to change unless we get this historic designation. And I can tell you. And the difference is going to be very evident as time goes. By between. Our neighborhood and the neighborhood south of us on 32nd. Avenue. And I would just also like to mention that many of the housing that's coming up in our. Neighborhood is very similar to the type that was has been. Constructed or in. Cherry Creek. Where, you know, the houses in that neighborhood used to be of 1950s and 1960s vintage, but are now pretty much all gone. But that could very well can happen in our neighborhood as well. So I strongly. Ask that you vote. Yes. And I thank you very much. All right. Thank you, Mr. Arm. All right, next five. Rosemary Stovall. Camille. Paul. Mary Joseph Halpern. Thomas Simmons and Lisa Leslie Fogel. We're on the homestretch, everyone. Just a check in under 20, under 20. All right, Rosemary Stovall. All right. Under 18. Cook. Camille. Paul. Mary. Hello. Members of council. My name is Camille Palmieri. My husband, John, and I live at 36 Osceola Street in the Wolfe Place Historic District and in the landmarked, Herman Hugo Heizer House, the Wolfe Place Historic District was approved almost 11 years ago. This hasn't stopped people from renovating their houses. Three houses on our block have been renovated and sold in the last two years. We are currently renovating our house and we have been approved for tax credits. We have a new roof. We tore off it back edition. We replaced it with a new addition, a new porch. We're doing a lot of interior things that that, of course, don't need approval. Historic districts help maintain the balance among residential, commercial and multifamily buildings. The West Highlands has a number of commercial areas, including great restaurants and other amenities. The neighborhood also has a number of large apartment buildings and duplexes. The Packard Hill Historic District District will help protect the residential aspect of the neighborhood. The proposed Packard Hill District has some beautiful historic houses with turrets, decorative trim bay windows, stained glass, Denver, red brick and other Victorian details. These buildings house several significant figures. We have lived in Denver for over 35 years. The economic boom we are experiencing will not last forever. But if we don't protect this city's history, it will be lost forever. And yeah, I'm speaking and I don't live in the district, but why I'm here is just to say that. We we applied for, but we. Are. Sorry the guidelines that we had were approved and it wasn't a big burden and everything seemed pretty seamless. So thank you. Thank you. Paul Mary Joseph helping. Good evening. My name is Joseph Halpern. I live at 519 Ogden Street in the Alamo Placidia historic district. I'm here even though I live outside the district because we have 17 years of experience with a middle class, historic district. We were the first middle class historic district ever created by the Denver City Council because like Packard Hill, we had a few grand Victorians built before the silver crash of 1893. And after that, it became a working class and middle class neighborhood of bungalows and a lot of even one story duplexes. When we came before you on June 12th, 2000, or before your. Predecessors, other than Councilman Ortega, who was actually here at the time. We had it's very deja vu because we had a very similar situation. We had a deeply divided neighborhood. There were lots of. People who. Were opposed to it. There were lots in favor. There were lots of passions on both sides. And at the end of a. Very long hearing that went past midnight. The council unanimously. Approved it, but not without some misgivings. And I'll never forget what Councilwoman Ramona martinez said. She looked directly at the landmark commission staff members who were there and said, Take back to your commission the following. You cannot. Treat a. District like this the same way you treat. Denver Country Club and Humboldt Island Historic. District with their big fancy mansions. You've got to recognize different contexts. And the Landmark Commission took that to heart. And the reason that that document that one gentleman showed you is so thick is because it covers the gamut and it covers. Big, fancy mansions. It covers modest. Houses. And it does it in a way that only a small. Portion of those guidelines are going to apply to any particular project in a given neighborhood. And it is a manageable process. I have seen an Alamo. Policy to, over. The last 17 years, numerous second story additions. The term pop top is disfavored. But that's what they are. I've seen numerous site additions, huge rear additions that have virtually doubled the size of houses and in in even on on. Infill lots and where there were scrapes of non historic houses, we've gotten some very modern architecture. Not my thing, but the landmark commission will approve. What looks to be like a malibu. Beach house in Alamo placebo. And that's fine because we need some. Professionals like we have on the Landmark Commission to make those decisions. And and so I just I'm here. To say to everyone. Including those who believe this can't work, it really can work. And it's worked in Alamo. Policy, too. And however this comes out, I hope that. Everyone will repair relations as we did in our. Procedure. We get along great and have block parties. And a lot of us were there 17 years ago. Thank you all. Thank you, Mr. Halper. Thomas Simmons. Council members. My name is Tom Simmons. I've lived in Berkeley neighborhood for 30 years and I'm a coauthor of this application. Since the early 1990, our firm has studied many of Denver's older neighborhoods for community planning and development. Historic Denver and neighborhood groups. These projects prepared neighborhood histories and identified historically scenic significant areas and individual properties if present. Our firm also prepared Denver Landmark District applications for downtown Denver, Pennsylvania Street Wolf Place in the early Lanham Ghost District. In studying the Packard Hill area, we employed the same techniques for researching and analyzing its eligibility as potential Denver Landmark District as we did for all these earlier local landmark districts, including identifying its historical significance, describing the nature of its architecture, evaluating the contributing known contributing status of the properties, and determining the appropriate boundary of the potential district. The historical significance, I think, was addressed rather well by Karen of CPD. The story of the expansion of the street street railways and the surge in subdivision planning and residential development is a very important one in Highlands and Denver's history. It emerged as a very significant middle class residential area from the late 1890 to the early 20th century. And it continues to be treasured by its residents. Today, as Laurie Simmons started to address and several older people have alluded to, the district is notable for its the activity of its women. By approving this historic district and recognizing its strong association with women's history will demonstrate your belief in the importance of women in Denver's history. The story of this often neglected and ensure young girls of future generations that there is a tangible link to those earlier women such as Dr. Mary Ford who paved the way. A number of people have mentioned that the district has about 82% contributing. And the way we assess that is we look to see if properties were built within the period of significance between 1886 and 1940, and about nearly 90% of the buildings were built within that period. We also look to see how altered the buildings are, and essentially a contributing percentage like that indicates that there's relatively few alterations and they maintain their character. I would also an earlier opponent produced a map. I would suggest that you look in your package at the map produced by CPD staff that shows favorable people in green, unfavorable in red, and that map is a sea of green for this district. I urge you to support the designation of the district, and I'm available for any questions, if you have any. Thank you. Thank you. Miss Simmons. Leslie Fogel. My name is Leslie Fogle. I live on Perry Street outside the district, but I do. Work on 30 West Street within the district. So I'm familiar with the area and I'm here just in support of the Packard Hills District designation of the Package Hills District. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Next five. John Olsen. John Harrell. Ginny Parrott. William Chesser. Jamie Chesser. And that's five. They're the chasers. Okay. Go ahead, journalist. Well, hello, my name is John Olsen. I am the director of preservation programs for Historic Denver in my office at 1420 Ogden Street in Denver. I want to thank the City Council for hearing the neighbors tonight and for this opportunity for them to use the tools given by the city to proactively improve our neighborhoods. But those tools, without action, do nothing to implement what those tools are intended for the neighbors before you tonight who have applied for this proposed historic district, have trusted that by using the tools of the historic ordinance, by methodically communicating their wants and needs with their neighborhood, that you will reward them by doing what they ask, by taking action to protect their homes and their neighborhood. Before you as the most thorough, historic district nomination in the history of the city. Packard Hill is right in the middle of an area under rapid change and pressure. The neighbors who have applied wanted to be proactive and manage that change rather than come before council. Every moment that change went awry. It was mentioned right here at council. That for them to be proactive and to band together to plan for the future. These neighbors have done just that. I urge you to vote for this application and make Packard's Hill a historic district. Don't deter a neighborhood's voice. A voice which did everything right to get here and which deserves your vote. Thank you for your consideration. Oh, right. Thank you. Mr. Olsen, you had 6 minutes and, uh, right on point. John Harrell. Mr. Harrell. Good evening, honorable members of the Denver Chamber of Commerce. My name is John Prescott. Call me. The last name is Harrell. My beautiful wife and I reside in the Cox Gargoyle house on Lowell Boulevard. That's the one that has a dragon out in front. Who are the years? I've lived in a number of places around the world. I was a military person for a long time and I've seen how some communities rise to the top. Others don't rise to the top. However, one of the most important things I've learned is continuity. Continuity and a community continuity and plans continuity and the way things are done. I believe in continuity and I believe in wonderful, good construction. Grandfather Harrell was a guy who did that fancy work like this stuff here. He carved it by hand and he taught me that if you ever do anything, stand behind what you do and make sure that you give it the very best of your talent and your physical skills. Because tomorrow all that will be left of you is nothing but what you have done will last for the lifetime of people. So therefore, when my beautiful wife and I moved to. Denver area. We met. And then we decided we wanted something that matched what my grandparents on both sides taught me. And her parents did the same thing. That's how we wound up in the area we live and the Cox car. All girl horse mix maximizes my belief that things should be strong if made out of stone. I was told to build on a hill so that people could see it. That's why we're there and our community. Just ooze with those qualities. I'd like to see it continue. I'd like to see it being voted upon as yes, because it's a good place for children to grow up and us old people can live the rest of our days. Please say yes to our area. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Good night. Thank you, Mr. Harrow. Okay. Come on. Come on, come on. Try not to clap. Okay. Ginny? Ginny, is that her? Ginny p. My sister. And she did have to go home. She had to go. Okay. Down one. All right, we have the Chester's. What? William Chester. I'm wheelchair, sir. My wife Jamie and I live in a non contributing home at 32 Tennessee Street with our two children and we've lived there for the last 11 years. A mere 20 years ago, the family before us bought the home for themselves. And despite the hipsters in the carriage house and a lack of glass on the windows open to the elements, but for shutters, they chose not to tear down, but to make it a home for their own family. And we're so glad that they did. I had a lot of things to say and topics to touch on. Everybody's covered that well. You guys have heard a lot of. Information back and. Forth. Property prices are going to go up. Property prices are going to go down. You guys know the exacting standards that our application process has gone through. All of the people here that are supporting it. Speak to the importance of this district and its meaningfulness to our city, and I urge you to support the district. Thank you for your time. Thank you, Mr. Chesser. Jamie Chesser. Good evening, everyone, and thank you. City. Council members. My family appreciates. Your service to this great city. And I'm here tonight to share my. Emphatic support for. The Packard's Hill Historic District in northwest Denver. I am Jamie Chesser as my husband. Well, our son, Hank, five and a. Half, is at home with the sitter, as is Vera, who's three and. A half. And as well said, we live at 3210 Osceola Street. We have a big peace sign. On our house. That's how I tell people where we live. And we've lived in the home since of. All days, Halloween 2006. And we love this community and we're so happy to call Denver home. We feel we have an extremely unique and special neighborhood in West Highlands. Our little piece of the pie in Denver. And I really appreciate and I've seen this over the last several years more, more so that Denver really recognizes the value in protecting these special places. And the fact that we have a landmark ordinance for over 50 years tells me that the city of Denver and the people of Denver see value in protecting our common history. Earlier, you heard Marilyn Quinn say the quote from Michael Hancock about when we lose homes and houses and restaurants, we lose our soul. I totally agree with that quote. I thought it. Was pretty powerful. I also sat in these very chambers a couple of. Years ago and heard Council President Brooks. Asking. Us to bring council historic districts rather than trying to preserve homes piecemeal. And we took that to heart, and that's why we're here. So thankfully, the. Vast majority of property owners in this area recognize. The history of the area and the historic character, the architectural. Integrity of the neighborhood. And would like to see it preserved for all of Denver and generations to come. I would urge you to please side with the vast majority of the neighbors who value the character that brought so many of us to make our homes here in this place. Please help us make sure that some places in Denver that are truly unique are preserved for all the people of Denver to enjoy. And I just urge you again. To please help us preserve this very special place in Denver. Thank you for your consideration of our application. Thank you. Thank you, Ms.. Chesser. All right, let's. Five Allison Williams Helm. Poor C cloud. John Paul. Mary, this is graduation. Terry Gulliver. Anita Lynch. Allison Williams how your first. Hi there. My name is Alison Williams home. I live at 3244 Main Street in the district that's being proposed here. I am in support of that district. My house is a queen, an 1893. So it's actually older than this period of significance. It's an obnoxious greenhouse, and a lot of people know it just because of that. I'm a fourth generation native of Colorado. I've only lived in Highland for two years. But I want to tell you a quick story about our house. When me and my husband were in the process of buying the house, the family who was selling it to us had lived there, different iterations of the family for 60 years. And they called our realtor no more than three times to ask, Are they serious? Are they going to leave the house standing? Are they going to tear this house down? Are they a family? Do they have kids? And so I would just like to say that to my neighbors. I think that we can get beyond this. And we are very close and we are divided. But I think Don would have been in support of this effort. So thank you. All right. Thank you, Michelle. Paul C clout. My name is Paul Cloyd. My wife and I have lived in our classic cottage at 30, 33 Yates and West Highlands for more than 30 years. I am a registered architect and a licensed professional engineer. I believe the application clearly shows that the Packard Hill District exhibits. Significant integrity to warrant designation as a Denver landmark. Parkhill is part of the heart of Denver. The district is bookended by exceptionally significant architectural designs. We've already heard of the 1886 Wilbur Bill's Ford house, the Dr. Mary Ford House by the distinguished architect William Quail. This sits at the southwestern corner of the district. And then at the northeastern district, we have the Cox Gargoyle house that you've heard about. In between these bookends, Park Hill is a, as you've heard, a mix of styles over the decades. These styles have. Ranged from Queen Anne up to the English Norman Cottages. This mix of styles is essential to the the magnetism and the attraction and the importance of this neighborhood. While the homes are of several different styles, there is an undeniable harmony in this multitude of historic homes. The district presents a continuity through its setbacks, the forms, proportions and exterior building materials. The historic district designation and the city's design guidelines are the very best tools for ensuring that these historic homes. Are not. Lost. The West Highlands Neighborhood Association Design and Preservation Committee, which I serve on, feels that the design guidelines can be of help to all owners in West Highlands of Historic Homes. While the committee often assists owners within the existing districts of Wolf and Coast, we are now offering that assistance to any owner of a historic house in West Highlands at their discretion. I can assure you that we see a number of projects coming through in Wolf and Ghost into pop tops, etc. These are not static districts, but we are getting some good projects coming through and in fact we have a popped up bungalow that we felt so good about. We forward it to the Mayor's Design Award Committee. It didn't succeed, but it was a really nice job. I'm grateful to have had a small part in uncovering a part of the story of Packard's Hill and sharing that story with the people of Denver. Please protect this part of the heart of Denver. Thank you. Thank you, sir. John Paul Murray. Good evening. My name is John Palmieri. I live on Osceola between 30th and 32nd in the Wolfe Place Historic District. I'm here today to share our experience that with all due respect, it is an added burden, and I understand that. But the burdens that have been in place have not been unreasonable or undue. We've been through the process. It's worked for us. It's worked for a number of houses on our block. There have been three that have been renovated, and I respect the concerns that are expressed. But it has to be a balance and that there are added burdens, but there are existing burdens, and that this isn't a situation where you have unlimited access or unlimited ability to do whatever you want with your house, their existing provisions in place, they have to be addressed. The added burdens have not been reasonable. Versus that the economic boom we're in now. Will not last forever if we don't protect the history of our city. It will be lost forever. Ask that you support the district. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Terry Gulliver. Thank you. I just checked my clock to see if I should say good. Morning. And thank you. My name is Terry Gulliver. I live at 227 South Lincoln, which is in the middle of the relatively new Lincoln historic district. Congress Councilman Clark's district, where Quinn and district are small one. I'd like to just speak briefly to some of the concerns that have been raised. From my experience with that. When our application was being processed, we became aware that one of the houses in the middle of the block, in fact the oldest one of William Lang's early and perhaps slightly klutzy experiments, was going to come on the marketplace, and we knew it would be scraped, and then that would be the end of our district because we would lose our critical mass. So a bunch of neighbors got together and formed an LLC to restore this place. And when they got our application approved, living just two doors down the street. I've been supervising a lot of the early construction phase of that house, and since it got complicated, we've had general contractor run it. But I supervise a lot of the early stuff personally and got to see just what the prices were. And I can say that it really did not add a lot of incremental burden to go through the permitting. And when we had questions, the historical stuff was very helpful on the phone and sometimes we went in with drawings and things to talk through them and they were much more help than hindrance. And somebody talked about the old red brick houses being crumbly and deserving to be bulldozed. And at one stage I thought that about this place as well. We I think we can now have a buffalo tango inside that house. It wasn't really that onerous, a matter of cementing the two layers of brick and the foundations. One of the concern that I heard somebody voiced, and I'm surprised that I only heard it once, was insurance rates going up. That was brought up on our application as well. And that's, shall I say, bogus. It just doesn't happen. If it does, your insurance company needs to be changed. So I would definitely second the sentiments of the gentleman who spoke before me and I'll get out of your way. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Miss Gulliver. Anita Lynch. Good evening and thank you all for letting us speak and for staying awake. I live with this guy at 227 South Lincoln Street. We are in that home. Our home was historically designated and unanimously approved by the city council. So thank you. We did our home first and then our block of 200 South Lincoln. And it it has been a wonderful experience. We know that it does increase the value we've already seen as we've had three or two people since it was approved that relocated to different cities. Their homes went under contract immediately. I talked to one of the people who was buying one of the homes and I said they moved here from California. And I said, What made you pick this home? Why did you want this house? And they said, We lived in a historic district in California. And when we came here, we told our realtor, we only want to see homes in a historic district. So it is not onerous in that manner. I think a lot of times we operate from fear and I think fear can override sometimes. I've seen this for myself, my own good judgment. I understand the fear of people here that you're not going to be able to do what you want to do to your home. We have standards anyhow within our city. We you know, if you want to be able to do whatever you want to do to a home, I guess you go live in the boonies somewhere. I don't know. But it is not it is not onerous. We've seen this. And I want to read just quickly from one of our neighbors who could not be here tonight. They live at 2 to 4 South Lincoln Street. There in our district is Carolyn Alden and Eric Bennett. And this is what they said. As owners in this historic block, we take great solace in the fact that none of the neighboring homes will be allowed to be torn down by a developer, by developers to construct what appears to be temporary solutions to the growing population, many being eyesores on the landscape. Historic designation is a must to maintain the integrity and value of these neighborhoods, no matter when they were built. We have gone through landmark preservation approval for modification to the exterior, and by providing a complete accurate submission, we received landmark approval very quickly. We believe when buying a historic home, you have a responsibility that comes with it to maintain that authenticity for future generations. We offer support to Packard Hill's neighborhood, and I also offers strong support and I hope council will vote in favor of this and preserve this neighborhood. Thank you all. Thank you, Ms.. Lynch. All right. The last two. Gertrude Grant, Stockton Baker. Bring us home. Well, Mr. Grant, you're up first. And I'm still standing. I can't believe it. My name is Gertrude O'Grady Grant. I live at 242 South Lincoln Street, Denver. And no, I do not live in the Packard Hill historic district. But I urge you to support this district. As Nita and Terri have just testified, a couple of us got together and bought a house in the historic district in which my house is located. And also this house that we bought across the street that we were afraid was going to be torn down and threaten the integrity of the row of houses that would soon be included in our historic district. We're making new numerous improvements, several of which required approval by the Landmark Commission. And if you get a decent. Architect who knows the. Price, it's grim. This grant was great. Mr.. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Just if you wait. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Know, just. Just just talk to us. We thank you, architect. Who knows the system, knows the rules. Things go through landmark like that. It does not take a long time. Any delays that we have were not caused by the landmark designation was caused by the scarcity of construction workers in Denver's boom time. In any decision like this, it's impossible to find 100% support. And it's true there are going to be people who, for whatever reason. I think most of it is fed by fear and false information, are not going to support historic designation. Some claim that creating the historic district is the taking of property rights. I disagree. Yes, it impacts what you can do with your property, but it gives you guidelines that you can follow in order to preserve the character and integrity of your neighborhood. In fact, even though the statistics show that property values have increased ie in historic districts, that to me is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that it gives a security that is gained by knowing that the houses on your block can't be changed in ways that destroy the character of the neighborhood and make it totally incongruous. Denver strives to be sustainable, yet construction debris is approximately a quarter of the landfill waste. Old growth, oak and brick from demolished houses go to the landfill. Our old brick houses can be renovated and and remodeled for larger families. We cannot replace the craftmanship not only inside, but the brick detail outside, over the doors and windows, on the chimneys and along the facades and sides of these older houses. What will we show the next generation as great grandchildren that we value? Ms.. Grant. Your time is up. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Wow. Stockton Baker. Number nine. Number nine. Bring us. Home. My name is Stockton Baker. I live at 435 Humboldt Street. My wife and I live in the Valley Park Place Circle District. Bottom line is the best decision ever made. If you want to preserve the character of your neighborhood, you vote for this. If you don't care about the character neighborhood, you can't control your neighborhood. You vote against it. I urge your support to vote. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Baker. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, the comment portion of this public hearing is now complete. Thank you all for being here. Thank you for being very patient. We will now go into questions by members of council. Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. I know a lot of folks have left and I hope some of them are still here. I had some questions for Christina and Alex Holderness. Are they still here? Hi. Hi. 3221. Osceola, do you live there? We do not. Not currently. You're on Marion Street? Yes. Eighth, eighth and Marion basically. Between eighth and ninth. Yes, sir. Okay. And you bought this house in 2009 for about $255,000. You're looking at public record, obviously. Yes. Okay. What's your intention to. As I stated in my comments, the intention was to knock that house down and build a house for ourselves that we could make our own home and grow old. And so then you would move from Marion to Marion Street? Absolutely. Our intention to move from Marion when we had the funds to knock that house down and build a modern house. Okay. All right. Thank you. Is Mark Macaluso here? Hi. You build a duplex and while you're walking up to the microphone and I took a look at that online and it completely out of character with the neighborhood. What why did you decide on that particular? It looks kind of like a cube sitting in the middle of these bungalows. Why did you decide to build a house of that style in this particular neighborhood? Well, as I said earlier, or life in general, what makes our country great is diversity. And, you know, I wanted a house to appeal to more than just one set of people. And the people that I have in the other side of the house are very fine, upstanding people. So. I mean, I just I like diversity. I moved into the neighborhood not because of. The houses, but because of where. That's where the proximity it's located. And and quite frankly, I think you can ask most people here, and they're going to say that the charm of the Packard Hill district is the feel, the quiet, the peacefulness, the neighborhood, the it's it's quaint. It's not necessarily the houses. I mean, it's located right next to Denver. So you have urban living. And that's that's an appeal to most people. I wanted to live in the city and I didn't want to live downtown. Right. You know, in the heart of the city. So you get the urban feel, plus the neighborhood feel at the same time. So I wanted to maximize the square footage of the house because I wanted families to be able to move in their multi. You know, I wanted people more than just a husband and wife. I wanted family, kids. I mean, that's why this neighborhood is is appealing. And you ask and you look at the just look at the demographics on both sides. You see young and you see old. Right. So if you if you want a home. Okay. Sorry, I just I back you younger, more experienced. Yes. As someone who just signed up for Social Security, I resemble that remark. Thank you. Either way. Either way. I'm glad you let me ask. One of the ability for for families to grow. Thank you. And that's the vibrant appeal in the neighborhood. All right. Thank you. Kara, can I ask you a couple of questions? And based on some of these in the presentation I saw there was a house as actually somebody testified here. And you mentioned there's a house in the Wyman District that has a glass cube in the rear. Yes. And how was that allowed? That's an exterior modification. Is it just because you couldn't see it from the street? Yes. So it wasn't highly visible from the street. And so you can use modern you can use modern. Materials or. Other materials. But yet and. That's an historic district in the Wyman District. And and I looked at it while you were testifying, and it looks kind of bizarre. Can you put solar panels on a house that's in a historic district? Yes, there are design guidelines for it, but yes, they can be put in a historic district. Okay. And there was one individual, Matthew Brown, who said he would not be able to pop his top. Okay. That would be financially irresponsible. What are what are the guidelines for expanding and popping a top on a on a historic house in a historic district? That's a craftsman one story. What what obstacles are in the way of that that are not present in a non historic district. So the design guidelines call for tafsir and you know sort of additions to be set 15 back from 15 feet back from the front facade, which would probably be what they're talking about is probably the largest. Difference between that and not in the historic district. Okay. Thank you. That's all, Mr. President, for now. All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Good questions, Councilman Castro. Don't. Don't sit down. It was so close. Yeah. You might as well just sit up there. Just some basic numbers. How many units, how many residences are in the proposed district? So there are 173 properties. When we send out our letters for the assessors, we sent out two one in June and one in August, and we pulled the current assessor records for each of those, and we sent out 185 letters one time and a 184. So that's how many letters we sent out to property owners. That could be two people on a particular who owned one building, but we sent out 100 and about 185 letters. We don't have a precise number as to the. Number of homes in the district. So there's 173 buildings there. You know, we don't have the precise number of addresses. Okay. 173 buildings. And how many are non-conforming? I want to say like 41, but I'd have to double check the numbers. It's 82% are contributing and 18% are not. Okay. And I assume you don't have detailed numbers like how many bungalow, how many queen in classic cottages, etc.. Those that those are within the it is within the application. I would have to pull it up, but they are in the application. Bless you. Thank you very much. And then one other thing to follow up on what Councilman Flynn had to say. The solar panel thing, you said there are some design guidelines. So, yes, the guidelines address solar panels and they call for the solar panels to be on the rear two thirds of the building or anywhere on an accessory structure. Okay. That's all I have for right now. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Castro and Councilwoman Black. Thank you. I'm not sure who I'm asking this question of, but maybe we'll start with you, Kara. So I'm still not clear on who is in favor of it and who is opposed. I was the person who requested the green and red map, but I know that it's not entirely complete. And this group provided a map that and they said they have 75 that are opposed, which this map has something like 21 opposed. So that that is a vast difference. And personally, I can't make a decision with that big of a discrepancy. So. So so the. Map that we. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. The map that we created incorporated all of the comments that CPD had received. And it came from a variety of sources. It came from public comments, both in support and opposition, a petitions that the applicant submitted. It came from letters that had been forwarded from City Councilmember Sussman. Councilwoman Sussman said forwarded a lot to us. And so it was an aggregate of all of the the public comments that CPD had received prior to submitting our staff report for our deadline. And so what is on that map reflects what we had received at that point. There was a petition that we received after, you know, on Friday that was not incorporated into our staff. Report. From the people in opposition. And did you evaluate that or it was just too late? I mean, I didn't do as thorough evaluation as I had with the petition from the supporters because it had come with enough time. So I had gone through looked at all of those and about for about 75% of those petitions, I had pulled up the assessor records to make sure we were matching on those. I didn't do that for the petition in opposition because I just simply didn't have the time to go through and do the assessor today. What they. And. Okay, thank you. And so whoever put this together, can you come? Okay. Notification. If you'd like it, we can provide you with the petition, with all the signatures and the addresses. My wife who submitted that map, if you'd like to see it again, I'm happy to show it to you. I spent three weekends walking the entire district, knocking house by house and delivering fliers and asking people if they were in support, if they were willing to, or if they were willing to support the Keep West Highlands Free Petition. We met myself. I walked at least 60% of the district and gathered most of those signatures on Oakland. Is that what this is? That's what this is. That would be the signatures distilled into an Excel. Yes, that's what this represents. So I actually know by knocking on the door and getting those signatures because she did it and I did it, that there's 75 people who signed it. At least. Does that answer your question? It does, but I it leaves me in an uncomfortable position because I don't have. May I may I. Come in confidence in either one of these? May I comment while I completely respect and understand the process that Landmark uses? The Landmark Commission had ample opportunity and was addressed numerous times regarding the potential opposition. As a matter of fact, when Landmark presented in this building about a month ago, the opposition was prohibited from making any statement to try and clarify numbers which we believe were misrepresented at that time. I personally spoke to the representative from Landmark and told her that she was vastly underestimating and underrepresented in the opposition. So it is my opinion that Landmark had either no intention or just no time, as Carol said, to run down the fact that there were continuously opposition people in these meetings when we were allowed to be there and when it was beneficial to us. Thank you. I was at the looting meeting and. Yes. And it's not our place to speak at that meeting. We understand that. I do. I did sort of keep track of people speaking tonight. And by my accounts, more than half of the proponents who spoke don't actually live in the district, which I find troubling. I did count, I think, five opponents who don't live in the district. But that's all I have for now. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. A couple of themes are emerging. I want to go back for a second to the solar panels. So maybe this is an area that we need to. Do some work on with our code. It was presented earlier by someone that. Well, yes, they are allowed. The restrictions are so restrictive that of everyone who's ever applied to put solar panels in a historic district, every single one of them has been told no. Is that a true fact? Not that I would be aware of. We I'd say we get 3 to 5 applications a month that we review and approve of solar panels. The majority of those are approved administratively. There are occasionally ones that go before the Landmark Preservation Commission. But we it's not the thing that we see the most often, but we see on a fairly regular basis. Is there any way you could just follow up with that data on how many have been applied, how many have been approved, how many have been denied? Is that data available somewhere. And not readily available? We could do some work and start pulling back. And talk about that of mind. Now to the maps. I find the maps also highly. Confusing and contradictory. In fact, as I'm looking at the two of them, I have them both pulled up here. There are places. Where the opposition map is red X is. Not. I can't tell what house they're on top of. The the. The map you've provided has addresses. So the only. Place I can really tell is a glaring. Disparity is on. Osceola, it looks like. You know, on the top left. Part of the map, if you're looking at it, it's all green from the corner in four. One, two, three, four, five, six houses on your map. And there are four. No dots. That looks to be those same exact houses on your map. So, one, can you speak to what might be going on there? And then if you guys can come back up, you did that and you knocked on doors and you knock on doors. You often run into people who don't own the house, rent the house. What kind of verification did you guys do? But how what what what do you think is going on there? So part of it is there are people who signed the petition both for and against or signed one or the other petitions and sent a letter either for and against. So there was one letter that I received prior to submitting a staff report that said I had initially signed the petition, but I'm actually in opposition, so we took them off of the support to the opposed. But I know that there is some level of conflict in that, given that people have voiced to opinions on the same topic. And would you would you guys mind coming up and talking to how did you confirm that it was a property owner and not a renter? When you're going door to door, you're most likely to run into whoever lives there. I can speak to that. I'm Kevin O'Connell, and I was also involved with the data collection and the petition. As you see, I was the holder of the petition and I personally checked all on the assessor's records of the signatures we had. I was aware of one disparity out of the 75 that we have down. I can tell you that I'm aware of three people that were on the proponents or three signatures or addresses on the proponents petition to no longer living in the neighborhood and one that changed their mind. So I'm pretty confident. I think when I ran the last numbers today, I think we were if there were also three who signed both. So if I took those people off like the police, whoever is at their door, yeah, they nullified each other or something. And then, um, the. I don't, I couldn't tell you, but you're pretty confident if. I were to go here through what you guys have provided in terms of petition, name and address, you have verified through the assessor's office that the signatures you had are, in fact the property owners, not the property residents. Correct. I would sign an affidavit to that effect. Like I said, I know of one personally that there was disparity in the records. Versus the signature. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Sure. All right, Councilman Clark. Councilman Espinosa. Mr. O'Connell. Sorry. Both you and Kara should stick around here on this front. So is it. And maybe actually, since you didn't do the poster. But is it your understanding that everybody who signed the petition is now showing up? Showing up as a red X? That's correct, I believe. There are 75 red X's on the map. Okay, Kara, when you do the map that you prepared for us, do you treat that the same way you sort of do with it? I mean, you actually do with a protest petition in that it has to be in order for for it to count as a full building, it has to have the title holders. So if it's only if there are two named parties on the title, it has to be both or anybody who lives at that house. So the petition, the signature petition that was put together by the applicants. That's the manner that they went forward, that you had to have everyone on the assessor record before they provided it to us, says comment that they were in support. And then, like I said, I went through and checked about 75% of those. Just to make sure that they were accurate. So from that sense that what was submitted. To us in what I could check. Those were the property owners. Okay. This is a question for the city attorney. Do you how can you make sure that the exhibit, the petition exhibit is is in your hands over there? Which. The one submitted today by the opposition. Adam Hernandez, Assistant. City Attorney I do not have that exhibit with me like the. One that they just handed to Councilman Black. But the wording here strikes me as is very, very odd. The statement at the top says, Our goal is to get the. No, no one has that yet. Hold on here. Well, everyone should have it on their email, but. Yeah, but we're having people catch up. All right. So it says our goal is to give a voice to residents who are opposed or ambivalent to the formation of the Packard Hill historic district. Adam, do you see that? Yes. Those are two very, very different conditions. Opposition or ambivalence? The code is I mean, are our processes very much treat. Ambivalence is sort of a is a benign position, neither for nor against. So would it be appropriate in a petition like this to indicate a signature and signature as being opposed? Is this really an acceptable petition? I really have no comment on that. This is something that's outside of the designation process. That would be a question more. Appropriate for the people who went through. This. Know, I ask because it sounds like council is giving this some credence, but yet it has the language, both opposition and ambivalence in the statement, the petition statement. So could I ask Council to read the line below that statement, please? We, the undersigned, are concerned citizens who urge our city council. To vote against the. Formation of the district. Thank you. Um, Councilman, do you have another question? So, I mean. It looks like the. Classic fine print. One of these is clearly much bolder than the other and no indication on how this was portrayed. I strongly suggest I mean, I spoke with you at length on how to, how to make this case, um, in, in consistent with the criteria and to put language like that is very concerning. Um, so I did have other questions for Kara. First, I wanted to thank her for the examples that were provided that Councilman Flynn had talked about. Because the there's a. It demonstrated a great deal of creativity that can be explored in landmarks. How can you confirm the 99% approval rate that was mentioned on landmark reviews? What goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission? I couldn't confirm that based on those numbers. It's about I would estimate it's about a 90 to 95%. But I have not run the numbers recently to be able to give a firm confirmation of what's come before the commission and been approved in the last year. Okay. Would there be landscape restrictions and does the approval rate of 90 to 95% also include those reviews as well? So so there is a section in the design guidelines that do address landscape. It's. Basically hardscape mean anything that requires a permit. So if you're looking to put in a fence or retaining wall, so far it requires a permit. So it's basically it's basically hardscape. Yes. It doesn't usually have the same approval rate. Or is it lumped into that now? Yes. So. So that approval rating is what goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission, as I believe what he was speaking to. And so what goes before the commission is about a 90 to 95% approval would be my estimation. And do you know what percent of Denver's city land area is designated or not designated? Our guys person at CPD estimates it at about 4% of the properties within Denver are historic districts or individual landmarks. Okay. Um. That was it. No further questions. Thank you. Councilman Hernan Henderson President, I have a general question. I wonder if anyone else is colder than me and I hope everyone else is cold and I'm not getting sick. Kara, I have a question for you. Since you were there, we have had people come up and talk about the length of time it takes going through Landmark. And I know you can't speak to individual cases, but can you give me some sort of just general? And if you don't know, I think that's perfectly acceptable. Well, as well how long it extends the process, because if you add in third party, it does extend the process to say that it doesn't is not being honest. So could you try to give us an understanding of how long that takes? I can't. And if it's okay, I'll kind of break it down sort of into the three categories I spoke about earlier. So a vast majority of what we do are what we call quick reviews, which is like a replacement. So like when when the hailstorm comes, we'll do a whole bunch of those. That's typically a one day review for us. The smaller projects are typically 10 to 15 business days, just depending on sort of our workflow. We're at sort of peak times summer, so it's probably closer to the 15 day review and those are. For. It can be for like solar panels, smaller rear additions, things that we can approve administratively. And that's about 75 or 70% of what we do. About 30%, give or take goes to the Landmark Preservation Commission. And those typically are a little longer review. There's a four week filing deadline prior to a commission meeting, and during that four weeks, the idea is that staff can work with the applicant to refine the project so that it is something that can be approved before when it goes before the commission, which is why we want to work with the applicant. But that is about a 4 to 6 week time period. If you're doing some larger infill, that is the longest time period as that is a two part review process. So the part, the top example that was given that would be the four week review, I would assume. Typically, yes, there is also for rooftop additions, 80 use which are not allowed by zoning in in this particular district right now. And. In full. I go to the Arnaud's for comment and that is a three week time period. Okay. So it's it's reasonable to say that there are examples where I could go an extended beyond just a 1 to 10 or 15 days. Yeah. Yes. Thank you. Kevin O'Connell, I wanted to ask you a question, and I'm staring at your partition, so I don't I don't believe there is any ill intent of trying to deceive people and everyone and grown adults. You should read what you're saying. But your your first point, I just want to ask quickly, and you could just give me a couple of examples. You say you want to add a voice to people that are opposed as if you were implying that you did not have a voice. And if you could just briefly give a couple examples for why you feel that if you're in opposition, that you did not have a voice? Of course, that I think that speaks to one of the problems with the the ordinance that it's designed to make historic districts. It's not designed to give people a voice who are opposed to having their properties incorporated into a historic district. You know, we we did try to foster conversations with our neighbors. It was very difficult. It almost seemed as though we were being told it's our way or the highway, we're going to do this. So there came a point after a couple of years of this that I decided, well, people, we need to know who's actually not for this. It's easier to say nothing than to stand up against something. Great. Thank you. Sure. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Thank you. Councilman Herndon, I guess. Councilwoman Gilmore. Thank you. President Brooks. Kara, I have a couple questions for you. Um. Back to the landmark designation criteria on the history piece. I know that we have in your report that there's a direct association with historical. Development. And that it's women's history. But we're basically talking about seven individuals, four women and three men. And I'm unclear as to did they reside in. I got a little insight from Mr. Moline when he came up and shared that some of these individuals. Did not live in the district. But I wanted to get more information from you as to the four women and three men. Did they reside in the district? Did they have homes? How long was the duration or did they just have some sort of. Association with. The area? So those were the. People that we highlighted who were or the authors highlighted and then I highlighted in my staff report that resided in the district. So so all the people who were influential in the district, those were people who owned property and or lived in the district, primarily those who lived within the district. And I would also like to if Tom and Lori Simmons are still here, as the authors who did the research, they may have also like more insight than I do as someone who just reviewed the designation. So r r. So when you say reside or owned property, are we clear that all seven of these individuals resided in the district? It's my understanding, yes. Okay. Do we have their addresses? Yes, they are in the designation. I can go and pull those up if you would like. Okay. That would be helpful because I have been looking through all the staff reports and all of the information and I don't find it clearly that they actually resided in what their addresses was so that that would be really helpful. And then to the architecture piece. The second criteria. That it's significant work of a recognized architect or. Master builder. Do you have the number of homes. That. William Quayle built? In the proposed historic district. There's one within the proposed historic district. A number of his. He didn't do a ton of residential. He did a lot of churches, schools, organizational buildings. A number of those have been demolished. So his work is fairly rare now at this point, that is still standing. And so it's an because it's one of the few pieces that are left of his. But it is one property. So there's one property for him. And then how many? By David and Tilden. Cox family, too. Okay. So there's. Three total structures. That. These architects. Yes. In the district. Okay. And then back to the the map. So. I share the concerns of my colleagues because going through on the first map that you had sent us, you know, immediately we started counting up the number of addresses that were on the map, and we came up with 180 addresses. 70 addresses were in support. That comes up to 39%. 22 were opposed for 12%. But was what was most troubling to me was that 88% were non-responsive, and that's 49%. That's the highest percentage. Could you talk a little bit I know that you sent letters out. It sounds like there were some community meetings, but. But what is the process to hopefully get that? What is clearly a majority of at least those addresses that we were able to count up to, to speak with those folks and have a conversation with them. So so I participated in two public meetings that were held in January and February of this year. There were 35 to 40, maybe 45 people at each meeting. So we we spoke with, you know, answered any questions. And then I stayed. And if anyone had any questions afterwards that I was happy to answer with those. We sent out a CPD to notification letters that were to all property owners based on assessor records, so that we were making sure to hit all the property owners and notify them first of the Preservation Commission upcoming meeting. And then as well as letting them know that if it went through that it would go to the planning board. And then providing my contact information, as well as the landmark general landmark in box, if they had questions to send it that way and then sent a second letter in August, pulled the assessor records again and sent another notification letter, making sure that everyone knew that it had gone through and Preservation Commission in the Planning Board and was now starting through the city council process. Okay. All right. I think that's all my questions for right now. All right. Thank you. Thank you. President Brooks. Yep. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilwoman Black backup. Actually, Councilwoman Black. We have Councilwoman Kenny and Lopez and accused that. Okay, they have an ask a question you can each. Thank you, Mr. President. Couple questions, I think, for Kara. Can you just clarify for me very quickly the difference in terms of process for contributing versus non contributing? Building someone who is a non contributing building mentioned to me that they would go through the same process but without the tax credits. And I wanted to clarify that. So, yes, so when you're within the historic district, it goes through the design review process, whether it's contributing or non contributing, the changes that could be allowed to a non contributing are obviously different because that property could be demolished, whereas it's highly unusual for the Landmark Preservation Commission to approve the demolition of a contributing building. So the. They still go through the design review process, but it's slightly more I don't know if lenient is the correct word, but there are probably more exceptions that are approved by the commission or by staff. Okay. Thank you. And you actually touched on my next question, which is about the question of demolition. So there is eventually a lifecycle to a property, whether it be structural or materials breaking down. And so again, we had a speaker who said that you cannot demolish even if you have a structural or, you know, the materials are no longer sound. Is that accurate, that there's there's no end to the lifetime here? They typically it goes to the Landmark Preservation Commission, if it's a contributing structure. And they do not frequently approve demolitions. But if it if there's life safety, if there's something like that that is demonstrated, it could be demolished. It's just not simply that there's something that typically occurs. We. Yeah. And you can't go through an economic hardship process, but that is also fairly rare. Can you just clarify for me? I'm sorry, Mr. President. I'm just. If you let me know if I go too long. But is there a standard that says, like, if you have, you know, if your foundation is shot, you don't have to spend $1,000,000 to redo a foundation just to say, you know what I mean? Like, is there a written standard in the guidelines that have been talked about? There's a written policy that we have that that is available and that they would need to then demonstrate from, you know, from a structural engineer or someone who can say that this is structurally unsound. And you can say that it proved that it can't be salvaged or something like that, then it would go for the then they would review it that way. But yes, they can go and provide that information, but they do have to provide details that it can't be repaired or rehabilitated. Great. Thank you. I have a question for one of the folks who was involved in the protest petition, and I hesitate to wade back into that, but I keep hearing 75 signatures, which is people. And I just want to clarify if every red X is a person or if every red x is a property because those are very different. Happy to clarify that we have over 100 signatures that represents 75 properties, addresses, residents. Yeah. Thank you for clarifying that. And then I don't know if Marie or one of the applicants wants to answer, but did you all have a conversation about a conservation overlay? And if so, what was your reasoning in not pursuing that option or what was what was considered at any point? It might have been early before your application, or it might have been after. But did you have a serious conversation with the conservation? Yeah. Well, let me start by saying that some of us actually have experience trying to create overlays, and that includes pretty much me in the room. I don't know if there are other people and Trevor So we know some of the pitfalls and some of the difficulties with that. We also know that for this particular intent, it being that we want to keep the historic homes in this neighborhood, an overlay doesn't do that and overlay an overlay would probably be more suitable if you had a district which is identical buildings where they all have the same form and the same roof pitch, etc., etc. because then you could take one of them and say, This is our model. If we want to encourage commerce, excuse me, if we want to encourage construction that similar to this, here is the blueprint for what that needs to look like. As we've heard, we have Queen Anne's that are very different from Denver Squares, that are very different from terraces or duplexes as we think of them sometimes. And there just simply isn't an easy way to create an overlay that would mandate one kind of form when we have a mixture, an almost even mixture of four or five different forms. But most of all, we also know from experience, and I'm going to cite the Highlands, not West Highland, but the Highlands which are east of us, where the three overlays that went through recently I think took about ten years. So a, an overlay doesn't stop the loss of historic homes. And also if they take 5 to 10 years to create, we will have lost the neighborhood already, which is why I said in my intro that this is the tool we have available now. Also, I have not heard any kind of serious attempt at defining what an overlay might be. So I don't I don't think that there was a serious attempt at that from the other side now and then. This is my last question, Mr. President. So I wanted to go back to the criteria, and I think I'm clarifying a question that Councilman Gilmore was asking of the staff, but. Correct. Can you clarify for me in some and I read a lot of stuff, so I can't promise to point to whether this was in the application or supporting material and where it might be in the record. But is is the historic contribution of women just based on the named women or it's based also on a higher percentage of ownership of properties by women? So I just wanted to clarify, if we're hanging our hat just on the names of individuals or whether it's other historical facts about the district, because I read somewhere or heard somewhere in the process about this this larger percentage of ownership by women. And I just want to clarify when I'm evaluating the criteria, if that is if I can consider that or if I cannot. So there were there was higher ownership of women in this particular area. There was higher owner. More women who are involved in sort of the development of it in the the selling and buying of the property or in the construction, as well as the women who were named. And then there were the women who, just as a whole that were residing there that were heavily influential in the temperance movement. So it was the the women that were highlighted specifically, as well as those who owned or and or worked and then were involved in social movements, specifically the temperance movement. So and I just want to be really lawyerly here. Sorry. So and those are not just facts that you all have researched about the district, but they are facts that are tied up together in the criteria of the historic meeting, the statutory criteria. So so the other things that you just confirmed are actually relevant to your analysis of the criteria. They're not just side facts. No, no. We feel like this is a good, really good representation of Denver's women's history. And it wasn't something that I think the applicants expected to find in that. And so in finding that they were able to find that these buildings represent a portion of women who lived there and their achievements, and therefore is part of the criteria, because the buildings reflect the history of that time and of that era. And so it reflects the women who lived there, who were involved in the temperance movement that changed the way the area was annexed. And so that is part of our criteria as to why it's there, part of the history. Did that. Clarify? Yes. Thank you for clarifying. Thank you, Mr. President. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Canete. We're going to pop down to Councilman Lopez. Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. One of my questions was addressed, but I just wanted to in hearing the deliberations, I just wanted to ask, I think is it the applicant? Um. For the district. One. I mean, there was a lot of talk about what you can and cannot build in the back as opposed to the front. And it's a little different from. It's a little different from from a overlays on district mean the last overlay zone district that I was able to be a part of was in your district councilman was San Rafael with the O D9 overlay. And I just wanted to ask somebody. On the you might want to ask you want to ask Kara. Yeah. Yeah. So I heard testimony tonight about inability to add rooms, to add space. These are kind of small homes. And if they didn't have a if they wouldn't able to do it with the, you know, expecting kids and the growth of a family, they did have to move. What are some of the things that can be done in a district like this with the typical home that's in this and this area? So in terms of expansion. Rates, so something that would be. Yes. So as I was saying, there are like administrative reviews, which is about 75, 70% of what staff does are 70% of the work that we do. So you can do like rear additions if they're, you know, subordinate to the structure, which just basically means they're inset about four inches on the side and they're not readily visible. So rear additions are something that we review on a daily basis, review and approve on a daily basis. People, if they didn't want to do a full pop up, we often recommend with these types of houses to add dormers and then create space and be able to get a second floor through Dormers either on the side or the rear. You can do a side addition. A side edition would go before the Landmark Preservation Commission, typically because that's more readily visible and depending on how far setback it is. So there are a variety of ways to meet the design guidelines and expand a property, but they do have to meet the design guidelines. And each of that a little each one of those is different, depending on the home. Mm hmm. I mean, I've been on the structure, and it goes in front of the board. Just depending on. So our ordinance says that if it clearly meets the design guidelines and is not readily visible landmarks, staff can approve that the application. If it is readily visible, it's on the front facade or it doesn't very clearly meet the design guidelines. It can go before the Commission and the Commission can approve something, even if it doesn't meet the design guidelines, whereas staff cannot. And so it just depends on the size and the visibility as to whether or not it's something staff can approve or it goes to the commission. Error or how frequent are those kind of applications or no application for those kind of requests in front of the commission? And do you see any from some of the surrounding areas in this historic district? I know we have a bunch of them throughout Denver. So I just you know, I want to see if there's anything around. Yes. I would say Potter Highlands is one of our busiest historic districts. They also can do 80 use as allowed by zoning. So we see a lot of use coming in from there. But we see projects in Wolf and Ghost as well. And I've seen a rare edition, a side edition, seeing dormer scene pop tops. That is not unusual. We see those on a regular basis and get those on an almost daily basis. Okay. I just I want to I wanted to get a sense of how frequent this can happen. And it just may appear like it was almost impossible with some of the testimony. So I'm just trying to get that that sense of of just that that sense from you as somebody who sees it on a daily basis. Yeah. And I would say that it also depends on in, you know. How clearly the application, you know, like our timeframe depends on how clearly the application is in either the materials, is there a site plan, do the plans have dimensions? You know, so, so just getting a complete application sometimes can take a little bit longer, but with a complete application, we also highly encourage people to do come in for a pre application. Meeting with us allows us to give the opportunity to provide comment without a large expense in to architects to say we think that this would be something that would be, you know, administratively approvable or something that would go to the commission. But we like to provide that opportunity before people spend a lot of time, money or effort on a design that would not clearly meet the design guidelines. And it makes for a smoother process. What are some of the restrictions? And my last question, Mr. President, if I am able to proceed, is on landscaping and some of the some of the details on the landscaping. What well. What do you regulate and what's not allowed? I mean, I trying to get a grasp on that as well, too. Right. So so we don't regulate vegetation. We don't regulate your trees and we don't regulate what you plant. It's basically in general can be boiled down to hardscape. Does it require a permit? Are you trying to pave something? Are you trying to put in a fence in you know, in this particular district, the Denver Hill, which is sort of that role, is not a character defining feature of this particular district. So there would be higher retaining walls and that kind of thing, that or fencing in the front that would be approvable and would meet the design guidelines for this district because the Denver Hall is not part of the character defining feature of that district. Okay. That that that does clarify a lot for me because I think I mean, like I mentioned before, I mean, we've seen a few of these go by and sometimes it's easy to confuse these with overlay district uses and and the intricacies based on what wherever but whatever part of the city that you're on. I just want to try to get familiarized with what is a use by right in in in a universe like this in a situation like this. So so what you're saying is through the process, it's not uncommon to do additions that are not readily visible from the front pop tops, things like that. The other thing that you clarified was landscaping. It's not uncommon to be able to put a retaining wall if you can, if need be. And I think a lot of these things require permits anyway. I mean, I know I know anything, any time. I mean, I'm guilty of this. Put a six foot fence up because I thought, hey, I could put up a six foot fence. Look at me. I could build a six foot fence, I. I had to go get a permit after the fact. And it's happened a long, long time ago, but I didn't realize it. How did you realize that you needed a permit for a measly six foot fence? Okay. Thank you. Councilman Lopez. Well, I like to turn myself in for this. We'll have the inspectors out there tomorrow. Let's see. You know, I'm going to. I know everybody's getting back in the queue, but I'm a skip. Skip down to New and Ortega. You haven't gone yet. Go ahead. Okay. Oh, Marie, can I ask you a question? Help us with the last mapping or survey question. But did you did you survey residents in the neighborhood, in the district? Yes. Do you mean in terms of did we ask for a response? Yes. Yes. Can you describe the process? Yes, absolutely. So we started knocking on doors about 20 months ago, January, February of 2016, and we invited people for neighborhood coffee. Some people showed up. Some people did not. We continued door knocking. If anyone said that they were in support, we asked them to sign a form, like I mentioned. Later on we started pressing a little bit harder. So we were asking people for a response whether yay or nay. And we started doing that in December of 2016. And we had a super simple two question survey on the Internet to for people to respond and only. 17 people who are opposed took that survey to say they were opposed. So there was definitely opportunities along the way to engage and be part of the neighborhood conversation and to even just say, I am not supportive of this. Without having to face anyone personally, if that's a concern. But only 17 people took that opportunity. How many participated in the survey? Well, a lot of people, I think, at that point who were in support had already signed signature sheets. So they may have not taken that survey, but we did put it on, I think three or four printed fliers, at least three of which went out by U.S. mail to all registered owners, the property records. And we also put it on numerous emails, although we could, of course, only email people who had given us an email address and not everyone chose to do that. But we had 165 emails, I think, for our email list by the end of the effort. And you're surveying how many were in support. How many were in support in the survey that we submitted, including all the forms, 76 people. 26 and 17 against. 17 against that, let us know that way. In addition, four people emailed us, so we reported 21 against and 7 to 6 for when we submitted both to LUDI and to you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilman. No pop down to Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. Councilwoman Kinney. Yes. My question about the guidelines for the non contributing properties. I want to ask how the procedures are different and I'm going to direct this to you, how the procedures are different today for someone who wants to just do a renovation on their home versus having this designation in place. Is the timing any faster? You know, we have dedicated staff to work on landmark applications, whereas sometimes it feels like your your application for your permit gets in and it sort of disappears into this deep, dark hole and you're not sure when you're going to get it back. So can you just sort of define the difference between the two? So we're basically the four properties that are either an individual landmark or within a historic district. We're the first. Stop in the permitting process. So it comes to us first and it goes through our review, whether it's a quick review, a staff review, or a review that goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission, we issue a certificate of appropriateness that we email to the applicant and then say, okay, this is your first step in the permitting process . Please attach this as well as the plans that they have submitted to us. We stamp in sign and date, and so we tell them to submit those stamped plans and the certificate of appropriateness to their next step in the permitting process, whether it's residential or. So typically, how long does that first process take? So like I said, it just it depends on the scope of the project. So if it's. A complete application. If it's a complete application that landmark staff can administratively review, it's a 10 to 15 business day. Right now, we're kind of at like peak season in sort of our business. And then if it's a quick reroof, it's a day. If it's a longer process, then it goes before the Landmark Preservation Commission. And that's typically, I would say, 4 to 6 weeks, just depending on the timing of when. It gets, you know, on the other side, if someone's coming in just to do a riff and they're not in a historic district, how long it takes to get that turnaround, I. Believe that they have just implemented. And so this is beyond me. So I will just give you this is what I believe. They have implemented a quick review that is an online and really within the day getting the permit for that is my understanding too. We think that that. Application process that's expediting them for the non historic areas will eventually fold over to the historic areas. We typically will probably review it because we review are just our design guidelines are different than the zoning code or the building code. So that's probably still going to be reviewed by us. We do try it like we still we try to keep the the quick permits to a really like a 24 hour review period. So but I don't foresee that that that would likely go away in the near future. And if someone wants the pre application afforded to them so that they are making sure before they actually submit for their permit that they've got to complete application. How long does it take to get into to do that? So there's a pre application, it's a it's a form on our website. It's a really simple form that just basically provide some contact information. Here's what we're looking to do and then they'll provide us some literally like back of the napkin sketch kind of stuff that we get. We will then contact them. It'll be assigned to a staff member and we have staff meetings twice a week and it's normally handed out at that point and then that staff member will contact them and we typically try to do it within about a week of receiving it to set up an appointment that works both for us and for the applicant to meet and and discuss it. And typically that process is just to help them make sure they've got a complete application so that when they submit, it's not something that gets sent back for more information. Yeah. It's to help them that and it's also to provide them with some guidance as to what we feel like would meet the design guidelines and kind of ask them, you know, ask them what they're looking to do and then provide them with some guidance of what they can expect. If you are doing an infill, it's something that they would need to do and then we want to provide them with the step so that they have a thorough understanding of what it really is going to look like. We want them to know what that process will be. And my last question, how how often is it that you actually see an applicant having to hire an architect to assist them in doing some of the improvements that they want done? We get, um, we get some architects depending on the scale of the project. So if it's a, if it's a project that would require an architect anyway anyway, then we're typically going to see that. Or we would recommend that we also get things a lot from general contractors or. The garage. Contractors or the guy who puts up the fence. So, yes, I do have one last question. If if. A homeowner is looking for someone that has had contracting experience with older homes in historic districts. Do you all provide recommendations? We do not provide recommendations. However, we recommend they contact historic Denver, who may be able to provide them with recommendations. Great. Thank you so much. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. All right. We're back at the top. Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm not sure who can answer that, but I believe when you started, Kara, you said there were 17 applicants and that they all lived in the district. But of people who came and spoke, I thought I heard three people say they were applicants but did not live in the district. Can you clarify that? I can't clear, but I know that there are some who own property, but are. I don't live in the city and county of Denver, but they own a property within the historic district, so it's like a rental property. So there are a combination of that. And I would let Marie perhaps speak more specifically to that. The number I believe there were only a couple of people who did not actually reside in the district. But I would actually like to give you a read the specifics. I think it might be an easier answer than that. So I'm just going to scroll. Applicants Jamie Chester will Chester live in the district are here. Carmen Trio is or was here. Is here. Thank you. Iris Elkabetz is here. Who lives in the district. Matthew Gibbler is not here but lives in the district. You don't have to read them all. Oh, sorry. They all live in the district. I'm sorry. I was trying to confirm that. Well. So let me just scroll without talking then. Yes. Yes. I think they all live in the district, from what I can tell, and with very few exceptions, also own property in the district. Of course, the exception would be if somebody lives with somebody who owns property in the district. Okay. Thank you. And then. Kara, I guess this is for you against a lot of the opponents have expressed a willingness to. To look at other opportunities or a less contentious way or consensus or a compromise. I typed all those words up, but what are the other options? Maree addressed the issues with the conservation overlay. What are the other options that are available that would preserve the character of the neighborhood? That might not be as extreme that maybe the two groups could agree upon? I mean, conservation overlay is generally the other tool that community planning in development offers to people if they're having questions about what their options are. You know, it's a different process than design review. There isn't the design guidelines that go along with it. It doesn't prohibit demolition. So so it's a different process and different, you know, it goes more through the zoning code than through the design guidelines. But a conservation overlay would probably be the other option that we would recommend if someone was going to look to do that. They. Don't mean exactly the same. Goals. But you know that other neighborhoods have considered that as an alternative to landmark designation. Yes. So you're going to you have to come to the mike and speak. So another tool to preserve single family or single storey structures would be a rezoning so that the Packard Hill historic or the area for the proposed Packard Hill historic district would allow for it to use accessory dwelling units, which you could add that square footage in a secondary structure, then you wouldn't need a larger home office, a guest quarters. So that structure could could accommodate the square footage for a single storey dwelling. Thank you. Thank you. All right, Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. Let's see. On if a modern house, a non contributing structure. Modern House. Cube house. Burns down. Can they build a clubhouse. In a historic district? It would need to go through the design guidelines. So probably if it met with combat, you know, is it compatible? And we're looking at like sort of mass scale height, some of the examples that we provided to to to see does it meet the design guidelines. So if that property met the design guidelines, yes. But it would probably my guess would be is that there would need to be changes to it for it to meet the design guidelines. Okay. Thank you. All right, uh, Councilman Espinosa, back up again. What date was the application filed? I'm sorry. I have to look at my staff report. I want to save the beginning of June or the end of May. I would. I'd have to actually check my staff report to give you the precise date. Okay. So I can do that if you'd like. Really quick. No, I saw the the notification. Was on June 15th. Was that is that immediate or is that a week later or so? We so the notification date for the for our letters is required to be no less than 25 days, but no more than 40 days prior before the Landmark Preservation Commission. It typically ends up going out about a month before the commission meeting. So so that notification letter is to notify of the Landmark Preservation Commission public hearing. So that would mean then it came in in May. It could have been. Yeah. I'm sorry. I would have to double check my staff report. I can grab that if you'd like. Yeah. I just I'm trying to track it down because several of these I mean, all these signatures, not all, but four of the signatures on here predate the that June 15th day. So trying to. Hold on one moment. Okay. If it's in the fall right at Stanford Port, I'll go ahead and look it up. Yeah, I look at the stuff, but. Any other questions? No, thank you. Okay, great. Uh, Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. Kara. Hello. I want to thank Councilwoman Gilmore for helping us focus back on the actual criteria in the code that we're supposed to base this on. And so I want to ask my remaining questions about that. I think there's no question that the first overriding requirement that it maintains historic and physical integrity is is certainly well met. And I don't have an issue with that. And the last one relate to a historic context or a theme. I think a case has been made for that, although in my judgment, in previous cases, I think I could manage to fit probably my 35 year old Melody Holmes house into that as well. So I don't know that that's really helpful. But so let me go to the specific history, architecture and geography. And you have there is no geographical criteria that was even considered here or was it and rejected? That was not a part of the designation application that we received. Okay. So the applicants never asked for, although the commission and the staff have actually added things that were not requested by the applicant. Did you consider the geography make a special contribution to Denver's distinctive character or anything like that? We reviewed the landmark staff, reviewed the application as it was submitted to us. Land Preservation Commission has in the past recommended have. What is the difference in staff's mind if not the commission? You can't speak for the commission, but the historical criteria A is have direct association with historical development of city, state or nation. What's the difference between having an association which would try to build a case that almost I could associate almost anything with the historical development of the city? And so what distinguishes that from a direct association, and why does this meet that criteria? So this is you know, it initially started out as a community outside of Denver and then it was annexed into Denver. It was so it's directly associated with the development and growth of the community of Denver, the trolley line that was established further, the growth of Denver. And so this is a directly related to people who had been within the sort of urban core of Denver and had moved outside there than outside the city and county of Denver. And then they were annexed back into Denver. That directly ties to the growth and development of Denver. Okay. Couldn't I say that about almost anything? It was annexed into Denver. It would. You know, what would what would they what would not fit that criteria? There. There would be like there's a lot of properties that we get that someone asks the question about and we're like, that doesn't meet the design guys. I mean, say that doesn't meet our criteria as something that, you know, that the direct rent, the direct tie with the trolley development and how those came up at a fairly simultaneous time in our intricately linked to each other. It ties it closely to the development. And the direct. And now the next one is see history, see, have direct and substantial association with a person or group of persons. And so what is the difference in staff's mind between something that has an association with a person or group of persons versus having a direct and a substantial association? There has to be some kind of a difference. Yes. So, um, so I pulled up the staff report that talks about and these are just some of the people that were highlighted and that the fact that they did, they did live in the you know, live in the community. They were there for an extended period of time. They had influence on the development of the city and county of Denver. They were residents in that. And so there was a there was a strong tie between the people who lived there and what they did to influence the city and county of Denver. Okay. Did did Ben Stapleton actually live there or did he own property? Do we know? I had no idea that he lived there. He lived there. I believe he lived there and moved to a couple of different properties. Okay. It sounds like somebody out there is saying that he did or didn't. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. That's probably not a good thing. And let me go to architecture, Mr. President, and there's two other criteria in there. It must embody distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type. And I've had problems with this one before. And I think, Councilwoman Sussman, her committee was going to look at revising this. I think that's something that needs revising. That's a comment. But again, my melody home down in southwest Denver has a distinguishing characteristics of a suburban tract house. What would not what would I mean? Every building, every physical structure embodies its characteristics, doesn't it? I mean, how what would not meet this criterion? Well, so part of it is, does it have the integrity to convey that significance? So does it actually look like what it used to look like? How many changes have been made to it? So the physical integrity and the architecture are really strongly tied on this criteria. And then finally, Mr. President, there must it must be the significant work, not just the work, but a significant work of a recognized architect or master builder, which buildings in this proposed district fit that to be, to be. So there are three properties. There's the the two properties. There's two stone properties on Lower Boulevard. The gargoyle and the yeah, yeah. Yeah. The Coxes are recognized master stonemasons and Master Stone Builders and these were two properties that they both resided in, but use different techniques in order to display their abilities. Right. And then for the William Quail House. And where's that at? Um, I'll have to double check off the top of my head. So on the corner of 32nd Avenue in Osceola. Oh, okay. The one where the Marilyn Mills lived. So. Yeah. And that that's one of its because there's not many works of his remaining left that's why is this a significant example. Are there any other houses of the 173. Other than these three. No. These are the three that represent the works of a master architect or builder. Okay. Two of those already are landmarks. They already are. Yes, they are. We're using them again. Yet because they're with it now. Toward the district. Because if they're strong enough to rise to an individual, you know, a property to be an individual landmark has to be a really strong case on its own. So if they're strong enough on their own to be okay, they would also be strong enough within it. What was the staff's consideration in saying that those two buildings, the Cox buildings on Lowell that are already landmarked, that their significance, their architectural, their master builder significance is strong enough that we should landmark a district. Three and a half blocks beyond it. It was part of the district. If that was the only if that was the only reason why the district was being landmarked was for those three properties, then no, it would not meet the criteria as an aggregate of the whole. It contributes to the significance of the district. All right. Thank you, Mr. President. That's it. All right. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Councilman Herndon. Name is President Carter. Just the last one for you. I want to make sure I keep this in questions, not comments. You. We spent a lot of time a couple of years ago dealing with this in Park Hill. And so I want to make sure. The Park Hill District. I might call L.A. with historic Denver just in case. I want to get the numbers right. There is a consideration of a historic district in Park Hill. How many homes were a part of that. I want to say? 745. 7700. Sorry. Okay. And so and I am sitting with questions, Mr. President. And do you and I'm good. And I want to make sure I got the number correct. 700. 700, correct. Yeah. The proposal. Would never became a full application, so it's not quite the. Same. Apples to apples. But there is a national existing national register historic district there that has just shy of 700 properties in it already. Perfect. Thank you so much. And if. They're no longer moving forward with it because they're now doing the conservation overlay. And I don't think that was a comment. I'll speak more that during the comments. Mr. President, I am going to thank you. Heard it. And you know, Councilman, I really admire your discipline right there. Okay. First. Good morning to everyone. Good morning, Adam. I have a question for you on just distinguishing between landmarks criteria. Just for the record, landmarks criteria and what are criteria is a city council. So when Landmark looks at the criteria in Unicode 33. The criteria. That Kara has laid out in her staff report. If the. Application meets those criteria, the LPC will recommend approval to City Council. City Council's review criteria is rather broad. You have. You can consider a wide variety of issues, including the written views. Of property. Owners. But you're not. Restricted to those views. Either you have wide latitude to. Make your decision or. Just just wanted to. Wanted you to clarify that for the record in case we drifted astray here. I got the last couple questions here, Kara, real quick. No one's talked about design review. Should this, uh, pass or fail pass? Um, there will be a specific design review for this context. Is that correct? Yes. Well, the design guidelines are citywide. But we will look at like, what is the character defining? What are the character defining features of this particular district? Like I said, like. Who will who will do that? Will that be the staff or will that be a community, you know, representative stakeholders in the in the district. So there will be the development of what we call character defining features, which are at the back of the design guidelines. I'd say like probably the last half or so of the design guidelines or character defining features that have been written for a portion of the historic districts, the ones that we see the most activity in. And that is a process that goes through both staff as well as the community. So we will contact the community, will ask what they feel is important. Staff will draft the character defining features, submit them to the community, to the Arnaud's. It's a very collaborative process that is eventually been approved by the Landmark Preservation Commission. Okay. Now, should this get approved, that will be that will start right away. Yeah. It would be something that would start, you know, at some point this year we would start the process of going through that. We have a lot of districts that don't have character defining features as well, and we rely partially on what is in the application and what just are the what is the character of that particular neighborhood. And look at those features. Okay. I was harkening back to to Whelton when we did design that. We got its own design guidelines. Had its own deal. Will this not have its own design guidelines? No. We don't want to create historic districts that, you know, each historic district has its own design guidelines. We want basically. Why not? Because then we'd have 52 different design guidelines. And that becomes more confusing both for staff, the commission and applicants. And so having one set of design guidelines that that fits everything other than the lower downtown design guide, they have their own design guidelines and five points have their own design guidelines because they are very unique into themselves . Yeah. That kind of to me would say that you should keep doing it, but that's a whole nother conversation for another day. Let me let me jump in to Mary. Um. I just want to say this is I have a bunch of questions, but seeing as it's the next day, let's just get into this real quick. So you met with me? Yes. In five points. Yes. And you gave me the number? Yes. 70 something. Before supporting, I forget the number who were against maybe 1015 and then some who had not been contacted. Um, you know, and I continue to ask you, you know, stay on this. Keep me abreast of this situation. And it seemed like as the process move down the road, here we have this. And so help me make sense of what happened from. You know, you've been you've been involved with it from the beginning. What happened to we have a larger contingent here. I pulled I was a little surprised, too, given that we had we had done a ton of outreach and we had really asked people for feedback. Like I said so many times in emails and so many times in letters, etc., etc.. And even though there was a very easy way to provide feedback, but there was also you could call or you could email. It was surprising to me that only 17 people chose to respond to say that they were in opposition and another four, like you mentioned, via email. And then as of Thursday noon, that number still stood. The Internet survey is still alive. And I think it also corresponds with the number of people who wrote into the city to say that they were opposed. Very close. So let me let me get to that, because that's really important. So 17 people as of last week. 17 for this from the survey and four via email. So 21. Okay. And hold it right there. Kamal, call you up real quick. When did you. I don't mean to interrupt you. I just want to make sure that I'm on the same. And when did you hear about the the number of folks that we have here? So I didn't receive the petition until Friday morning on. Friday morning, last week. Last week. So I had spoken with them and told them. They said, you know, we have a petition and like, you know, go ahead and submit that to us. So we haven't we can put it on the on the record in that we can see that. But we we did not get to see that much public comment in opposition. Like the staff report said, I think 85 187 individuals commented in support and 35 to 37 in opposition committed directly to CPD. Okay. Real quick, what was the timeframe between Landmark Commission and Ludie and Planning Board? So the Preservation Commission was June 18. Planning Board, I believe, was August 2nd and Ludie was August 22nd. And at that time you still held at 70? I mean, actually, I hadn't received until after Rudy. I hadn't received any formal public comment in opposition in sort of in writing. They they come to the Preservation Commission. Okay. They hadn't. They helped me. Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. I forgot your name. Kevin. Kenny. You're going to represent the those in opposition because you knocked on doors and you're pretty organized around that. So, I mean, that's 60 days. Yeah, I do believe it went past that. So we had the public meetings back in January and February and there was a substantial, I'd say, resistance to this. However, this goes along with the problem of the process. So we're having community meetings, but we weren't being heard. We had a very short time to answer, ask questions. And there were a lot of people who didn't live in the district at these meetings and making comments. So we had a quick frustration and. I understand all of it. But what I don't understand is these are very public meetings. Sure. And so when I say Public Landmark Commission Ludy, I've had very controversial things. People don't have any problem telling me that they don't like something. So that's what I'm trying to understand as 17 to 70. Yeah, I just 60 days. We did have a substantial showing at the Landmark and you can see that in the record. I think we had more speakers than they did from the district. Okay. So this this shouldn't be a surprise. I have been in the media. You have been on record saying it's split. Nobody wanted to hear it. Okay. Thank you. I have a question for Councilman Espinosa. Councilman, did you get a chance? Excuse me, Councilman Clark, your head's right there. Did you get a chance to meet with the opponents? And did you did you solicit their input? Did you meet with them and talk about ways that there is an opportunity for a compromise? Actually, five of them attended one of my community coffees on April 23rd of this year. And at that point in time, the arguments were hyperbolic. One of the gentlemen who spoke tonight, one of the gentlemen, has a very legitimate concern because he he has mentioned here that he's in a two year long process of designing the house and well to get to the point. One of my concerns is, is a bulk of these signatures are on February 12th. And several of them. Pages of these signatures predate that meeting. And to be honest, this is the first today at 937 was the first I had seen it. Okay. And let me just so that I think that's the point that I didn't know which is important. But let me just ask this very critical. Did you specifically reach out to the opposition? The sit down with them? No, because aside from Mr. O'Connell and the four members, I only have 11 emails in this entire time from Jane from from from the inception until this last question and then we're gonna go to comments. Sir, can you come back up? I just want to ask you one quick question. Did you or anyone who is in opposition specifically reach out to your council person and say, we are in opposition towards this, we don't want this to happen? Absolutely. Through email. Yes. And in person. I was one in attendance at the meeting. In the meeting. Okay. All right. Thank you. All right. This concludes the the hearing of counsel Bill 903. It is now closed. Comments by members of Council Counsel Min Espinosa. Well, I'm glad that you had that last line of question, because that's really, really concerning to me. Just see the sort of how early I mean, the first public meeting was discussed in February, and immediately there was this reaction and I'm not privy to it aside from the occasional emails, mostly from Mr. O'Connell, you know, to give really the whole reason I put myself and offered myself up in this position was to give community a voice. And so I worked with other members of the community to make sure that their notifications went out and said, Look, this is absolutely important, that there's outreach and you're communicating with everybody. And so I know that at least two full mailers went out independently of the city. And so it's very, very difficult for me to sort of hear that, you know, why wasn't there a petition saying, Councilman Espinosa, we would like you to consider a conservation overlay and get me overwhelming signatures with that, because I can't direct I can't direct our CPD staff to do these things. But when I have the weight and gravitas of a aam a plethora of signatures that helps move the needle. I mean you know because we've done it time and again. So it's it's it's disheartening. I didn't want to speak I mean say that but you know it's you know I look at this and then I'll be honest to my colleagues here. One of the things that really concerns me and this is somewhat cynical to state, but there were, in fact, more more homeowners in the district that spoke here tonight. Not many more, but then of the 2020 plus. Speakers that spoke in opposition. Ten of them are owners of non contributing properties. And so well one of the speakers spoke about how it's just 18% of non contributing. A third of those non contributing properties are here, really opposing design review. And it's not lost on me that that is a vital. Part. To this preservation effort is to shape and to, you know, to to sort of recognize the eclectic nature, the time, the progression that has occurred here and how all those different eras and epics have resulted in this heterogeneous community that that can actually be captured and codified and generated significant figures and generated monumental works of architecture next to more vernacular, and that they sort of all spoke to their era. And then, you know, the whole process of this is a simple design review. It doesn't preclude non contribution structures from being torn down and replaced. One of the requirements is that they be of their era and so mass and scale are not the end of the world as an architect. Those are our tools. That's what people were working with for decades, up until now. And that's what architects can work with going forward. And you can do modern in a whole bunch of different shapes. You know, if you looked at my own house, you would not recognize that, you know, you could not define it from the outside versus the inside, because there are two different things. And that's one of the things the attitudes that you have with landmark designation is, you know, what goes on inside your house is up to you , what goes on, how your your property addresses the public realm. It has to speak to the criteria that is shaped that designation. And for 52 times in this city, it has been acceptable or I think that's what it was mentioned. And so, you know, I have a I have a a nice letter here from and I've wrote a bunch of notes on it from as Gallagher who just. You know, I left this today encouraging myself and my colleagues to to. To support this, recalling the effort that he had in LoDo and there was massive opposition to that designation and we can all acknowledge that what we have there today is significant. And I think you all pretty much did acknowledge today that what you have today is significant with or without any additional restrictions. So. I went off script, but as one of the other speakers spoke, you know, probably better off that way. The. And it wasn't scripted. This was these are notes that I was writing through throughout this this evening, because I'll be honest. You know. Michelle, are you still here? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I put up flashing on her rooftop dormers in her non contributing house and. And. And so I have people that I have known for a long time on both sides of this debate, not just new people. You know, I don't separate you all like that and. And, you know, I was torn. So that's why I was paying attention. I really don't I don't like being surprised like this because that is exactly what I don't want to. I would like us to come together. I mean, you guys were together before this division. Unless we just took we dug in our heels in February and said, oh, hell no, we're not going to agree to anything. You know, but I don't know. We had one conversation. No. No, no, no, no. So, so. So. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. Here's the deal. We're just making comments. Councilman, don't engage the folks who are in the public right now. We're just making comments there. They've had their chance at it. This is your chance. Let's just try not to engage. Thank you. Sorry about. And I didn't want to engage because it's your. What you're hearing is my own sense of of of disappointment in myself. You know, it's just sort of not. I feel like I have a good pulse on my community and and would like to have known is if there was an opportunity but. Anyway, back to this. You know, back in March of 2016, following, you know, we had three individual homes and properties come before this council. All three were denied. In each and every case, members of this council said to bring in a historic district, not just one offs and individual landmarks, but that get the people together, define that area and make, in effect, change that way. So to help educate my constituents, we hosted a historic preservation forum at Edison Elementary. It had 100 different hundred people there in attendance, over 100 people in attendance from all parts of the district, including a significant portion. Of West Highland. And we addressed giving them the tools what what the advantages disadvantages were historic districts were discussed, conservation overlays were discussed. And it was a very educational process, a community initiated. Initiatives are an important tool. There are zoning code. I mean, R or ordinance. I mean our municipal code. Has created. And so these do these affect every single city, county resident of the city and county of Denver? And they're there to to to address matters of important concern for all communities in Denver. Not everybody is well equipped to take advantage of them. And it's not an easy process. And that what you see here was not an easy feat. The fact that there were 17 applicants, you know, like you said, that is. That is, there's more applicants that are affected, you know, than the number of contributing structures that were represented today by opposition. And after after months or years, seemingly two years, what was mentioned of dealing with this? So. With a split constituency. I have to ask myself, what are the consequences of this vote? Either way, is the character history architecture that merits protection? Yes, no doubt. And the research offered the existing built environment that you can go see and an experience today. And the capable individuals on the Landmark Preservation Commission all agree. That the qualities are there, the history is there, the narrative is there, the substance, the things that matter to this sort of designation are there. And the people believe that that is worth preserving and honoring going forward. There are there are a pair of additional I mean. Sorry. Are there a pair of additional required reviews to do certain work. Permitted work. Yes. Ten week process that that preliminary thing. And then your actual review. Are they as onerous as being described? No, not by definition. I can tell you there are good architects and there are bad architects and some that know what they're doing and some that don't. And it's hard to know as a layperson, who that person is. But there's you know, you can find them that they can help actually expedite not expedite but but really understand the what they're dealing with and to help you address your, you know, capture your needs and make it work within this criteria. The zoning code. The zoning code and the building code dwarf. These design guidelines dwarf them. And there are no pictures or diagrams in the building code. That entire book is solid text. And more of that applies to any individual project than this, you know? So can you still build, expand and grow? With designation? Yes. There is a clear desire within the community to preserve the character. And many, many people on both sides acknowledged the important qualities of the place that this is and the allure of this community. Only one finding tonight acknowledges the value and integrity of this history in the place and takes measures to inform the future while acknowledging the significance of this place and still accommodating growth and change. David Broadwell, our long standing city attorney, talked about it. You mentioned guts. I think that's what Dennis Gallagher's letter here sort of implies, too, about the tough decisions. And he even acknowledged that tonight we were going to have a tough decision. That's where this is for me. Would I like do I think that we could actually hammer out a way forward? I have no idea because we have not had that conversation. Do I know that that takes resources and technical ability that are at our disposal but are here? Yes, but I don't think, you know, that is a that is a heavy lift. It took Hyland five years to do that. And the rate of change, then that predated the the mean post that followed immediately with the recession. In these in this condition. We're losing history at an alarming clip. And if you'd been here over the two years and all the other. Conversations we had about where all the demolitions in Denver are occurring, 80 over 80% of them are in District one for an entire city. 80% of the demolitions are here. So. Many here speaking for this than are many here speaking for. Are impacted by this either in the proposed district, I mean, are impacted by historic districts, either in the proposed historic district or from adjacent, adjacent, landmark districts, or even heard from others not fearful of this process. If this goes through and I believe, as the LPC did, that it should, I suggest you this was me being tongue in cheek earlier. I suggest you need to change the name to gutsy woman women. Historic District. Sorry, guys. There's a lot of you. You know, I apologize for for for being thrown off by this, because what I was trying to to do in my own personal narrative on this was to recognize. That our streets right now in this part of town, you have things that other parts of District one wish they had. You have some great porches and people hanging out. Dog owners, no dog owners. People meet. You know, there's just so many strong connections among you all. How do we you know, I did not want to be the lightning rod. I actually wanted to say, look. And I don't know how my colleagues can vote, but if they vote, we're where I think, which is that this would be the right thing long term. I think in years time. I mean, I think tomorrow you'll recognize that, hey, this place is still as awesome as the day I moved here. And it will be awesome years to come and it is the right place to raise my family. It is the right place to fight for my dog park. It's the right place to fight for bike lanes is the right place to slow down traffic. It's the right place to encourage local business. It is. Quality throughout. And that you guys made it that way. And you guys will continue to make it that way and that this community is stronger because there's debate, but it's stronger because you will continue to clink glasses on porches and hang out and acknowledge and won't hold that grudge. You will continue to move on and say, look, let's work on these damn sidewalks. You know, let's support Cashman to get that money over to District One, level these things out and improve this neighborhood in the ways we can't. So I, I mean, I've rambled way, way too long, but I just, you know, I, I think I mean, I don't think I know. That it is a gutsy vote to say with this sort of the mix that we seem seemingly have in this room. But there are 83% of these properties that aren't even here. And that should also speak. Volumes that. Homeowners. In this area impacted by this area, I hope notified by this process. Are are also essentially looking to you all to and to us to just follow through with this decision. So with that, I've rambled way too long. I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of this landmark designation. Thank you. Councilman Espinosa. Councilman, her. Name is president and thank you all for being here. And hopefully I said that all my other colleagues don't have to. So we can be brief and get you all home before one. People say this all the time and you get so offended when they say, I feel your pain because I typically don't. But I actually do because a year and a half ago, this was going right in Park Hill. And I remember hosting that community meeting at McAuliffe where Carol was there. God bless her. She did a really good job. And I watched neighbors go at each other in a way that I hadn't seen Park Hill do before. And I had multiple meetings with the proponents. I had emails and conversations with the opposition. You would drive through Park Hill and you would see the red signs stop historic districts. You would see the yellow signs and support. And I sat down, I said, Well, you all go to mediation to see if there's something you can agree on this. And people looked at me and they didn't think it was possible. And they went to mediation and they found common ground. 700 homes on common ground. I met with them a couple of months ago and they're moving forward with an overlay. It's possible. And it's not going to take 5 to 10 years. I was I was respect, Maria. She said it takes that long as we're moving forward with Park Hill, it's not taking that long. So if there is a way community members can come together and find a solution so council doesn't have to make a vote that will just make one side angry or the other. That's what I want to strive for. And there has been so much developmental pressure on Northwest Denver, so I get it. I absolutely get it and understand. But I can tell you, representing Northeast Denver, for a community that feels the exact same way, there is an ability to do that. And I wish that that was just a conversation that happened because one of the opposition members spoke today and said, I would have considered an overlay. And then Marissa, well, we didn't hear you say anything about it. And so I sit there and say, well, why didn't that happen? Because if you vote in support of this. Then that's it. The district is there. But if you say I'm supporting opposition. That still gives you all the opportunity to come together and say, how do we preserve this community? Because from what I hear, you both want to do that. And so. I'm if there was. If there was not the ability for an overlay, I would vote in support. I would because I do believe in and the preservation of our homes. But I believe there's another option that can be accomplished, that the communities should come together and do so because we're doing it right now in Park Hill. And it's the same thing when it comes to the numbers. The numbers were different. Who's in support? Who's opposition? Depending on who I spoke to and Park Hill would tell me which way that was tilting. And so I just see so many similarities and I'm excited that they they came together and I hope you all will as to I hope you all will as well. And so I'm voting no, not because I'm against the historic but believe another avenue to move forward because we're doing it. And I hope you all will, too, because seeing neighbors seeing neighbors get torn apart for that was just it's painful. It really is. And I hope you all can heal no matter which way this vote goes. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilman Herndon and Councilwoman Black. Thank you, Mr. President. And thank you all for being here so late. I really appreciate your passion, Ron Johnson said. We all love our neighborhood to death on both sides or something like that. And it's apparent you all love your neighborhood, which is really, really great, Mary. And I can't remember your name, but you took me on a really nice tour in the summer. Thank you very, very much. I agree that your neighborhood is worthy of protection. When I said goodbye, I said good luck getting people to support it. And I referenced the Christina Park vote that we had last year. 92% of the people were in favor and zero people showed up at the hearing in opposition to it. Zero. And there were 176 homes in that. And that is a conservation overlay. I've been pretty consistent in these votes and I feel like when you are taking away someone else's property rights, you have to have a pretty strong case. I am troubled by the number of people who are opposed to this. I think it's about half and half. As I said earlier, about half of the speakers in favor of it tonight don't even live in the district. But I, I agree that 70 about 75 of them are in support of it. John Olson, I quote, you don't deter neighborhoods voice but half the neighborhood is opposed to it. And I just I feel like I have to honor your wishes. But you have all said you love your neighborhood, you want a compromise, you want to come up with collaborative solutions. And I believe you when you say that. And I agree with what Councilman Herndon just said. So I hope that you all can do that. I also agree, as many people said, that as a city, we need to fix this process. I believe that it is deeply flawed, and I don't think that private property owners should be put in the position of having to fend to defend themselves. They are on trial, so hopefully on our end we can get to work on that. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman Black. Dr. Sussman. Oh, thank you, Mr. President. And at the risk of repeating what my first two colleagues have said, what I was so impressed about was the graciousness with which you all treated each other tonight. We don't usually hear that in when there's a when there are differences of opinion. But it was wonderful to hear the that how much you respect each other and how and how and how respectful your conversation was. But I, too, am just sort of confused about the numbers and feel like there's more opposition than the proponents realize. And if that happens, I mean, we're all as council people, we always think we've told everybody, but maybe we haven't told everybody and we always think or maybe we've heard from everybody, but we haven't heard from everybody. And and sometimes these things take a little bit more time. I couldn't agree more that we do need to open up the preservation ordinance. And of course, I did speak with planning last year to ask, you know, let's open this up and take a look, because I do think both sides should have access to the same city resources. The one side shouldn't have more access to city resources about their petition than they than the other one does. So I've tried to put a line of fire under CPD that we get busy on looking at this ordinance and see how we can equalize at least access to resources when these kinds of things happen. But I feel very strongly that a compromise can be worked out too. I feel that way. And if. We go ahead and vote for this historic designation, then there's no there's no ability for compromising. It's a done deal. I think Councilman Herndon might have said that. So I will be opposing this evening as well. Thank you, Dr. Sussman. Councilman Lopez. Thank you. Council President Brooks. First of all, on August one, I've been listening and listening to everybody speaking, and it's hard to tell sometimes. I saw how you've divided yourselves up. Before, I couldn't really tell who which was which. But I do appreciate everybody coming tonight and everybody coming from the north side. This is not the first time that the North Side fills those rooms with. I think the first introduction I had to Late Night Rezonings was a completely different council. As a matter of fact, it was the council that first started on when they were looking at creating my moratorium because the demo permits and the development that was happening right before the the 2010 rezoning. And it was so serious that we stayed here until almost four in the morning. I mean, the 90 speakers that we had tonight was amazing, but it was nothing in comparison to what happened that night. And that was just a few years ago. And it was right before the recession. Then it went right into the recession. And, you know, if you think that we had a problem now, we truly had a problem then. And the decision was to hold off until we had the right district. All the one thing, that's for sure. I mean, maybe I've lived just south of you all my whole life. I know these areas like the back of my hand, and I know that they've. What's that? No, I'm just kidding. I know that they've. They've been faced with a lot of pressure over development. And it's no and I think everybody in this room we could all not our heads and know that this is a huge concern in the north side. It's no surprise. I would wonder where the heck you've been if you didn't agree with that. Everybody knows about it. Therefore, I think it's important that we recognize that there's a lot of different views on just what degree are we comfortable with. So I just want to say that I respect all you all for showing up tonight truly. And I respect the folks that have been organizing for this district as well to. I think it's I think part of the testimony I heard tonight was about gentrification. And, folks, if you look in the eye, I think that that's pretty much a done deal. In the north side, gentrification has already taken place to the point where a lot of the folks that were living in the north side aren't there. And let me just say, as as just a matter of fact, I cannot say that half of the neighborhood opposes the other half is supportive because the neighborhood's not here. There are still a lot of other people that are not here. And for whatever reason, they can't be here until the wee hours. Right. So to be able to be here in the chambers is, is, is. It takes a lot of dedication time. But I know that I know there's a lot of people I know a lot of people that live in this area. And I know they're not here. I don't see them in the pews. So I don't want to count them as a yes or no. I cannot say for certain that half of the neighborhood is opposed or in favor. Values. Somebody talked about neighborhood values. I'm looking at values right here. You're looking at in the high one hundreds and in the millions. And your neighborhood is very popular. As a matter of fact, this whole side of town is popular. It's so popular. I can't even afford to even make a dent on a beard out there. It is. It is so valuable. You have such a precious neighborhood. And it's precious because of that history. It's precious. And it's hard, you know. You. You all are sitting on something that. A lot of folks. Would do anything to live in. Right. And in a lot of ways, that's something that that does have value. And I really doubt and I whoever the realtor is that told somebody this advice that, oh, you know, you're going to have to sell cheap. There is no way in heck anybody selling cheap. And in this part of town, you live next to one of the most beautiful lakes. You live north in the north side. It is beautiful. You have mature trees, you got sidewalks, you got great setbacks. You got brick houses. You're talking to somebody that's in a frame house of cheap stucco. Right. You're talking to somebody who's almost lived their whole lives in a double wide and a crappy duplex. In the West Side. I'd love to have a brick house. And the charm that the north side has. So but what I'm trying to say is that's worth keeping. And however you all continue forward, it's worth keeping. And there are some nice new builds out there. There are. I'm not all opposed to some of the new builds. I think some of it's real classy, doesn't necessarily blend in, but that's just the name. I mean, not every houses is going to look the same or else we'd have Legoland. I really I want to address this now because I want to make this just out right in the future, and it's not the sign of the times . I think it's utterly disgusting when we use Benjamin Stapleton as a historic reference. That's not the kind of history that I want to remember. That's not the kind of history that. Yeah, he may have been mayor. But I cannot tell you. I can't even imagine the kind of people the kind of suffering people had under the KKK in Colorado. I don't want to ever hear folks say, oh, this is we've got to do this because we've got to commemorate is bad enough. We have a neighborhood named after the guy. It's a very dark history and a sad history in Denver, and I hope we don't commemorate it any longer. However, I do think there's value in the history in the history of the neighborhood. Right. And although, yes, we may have to discipline this room and David Broadwell is absolutely right. It is it's it's disappointing people, one side or the other at a rate that they can handle. And I hope folks understand the value that they have in their community that they can handle whatever disappointment that they're going to feel. Right. The other thing I wanted to say is that historic districts should not only be. East of the river. There's so many historic districts throughout Denver. I can't tell you one in my neighborhood. Because it's too late. I can't tell you. About which homes existed in Garden Place and which were original and which weren't because too late. I regard the home as the original Westwood. I can tell you the first few blocks of Barnum because it's too late. Somebody built the duplex on it and crappy at best. That history is important to us as a city. That history has value and it shouldn't just be reserved for neighborhoods east. It should also be. I mean, West Denver and North Denver have a history and a rich history in Denver as well. I think it's important to recognize that. The other thing is that I know my colleague has applied and done different things to try to preserve characters on his own and our characters in our sites full of characters. We'll find that out. No character period on its own. And I've heard folks in the chambers and the diocese and in the community say, well, let them do it. You need to step out in front and try to do this on your own. You all are doing it. He is your city councilman. He is who you elected to represent the district. I don't know. The District like you all do. I don't know the neighborhoods like you all do or the constituents like we all do. And so, you know, I think, you know, I hearing. His testimony also tonight. And when it's this so-called 5050, which I don't really think it's 5050. I think there's a difference that has to be had for that for that leadership in that representation. Also because hearing the testimony that you really don't. I mean. This doesn't prevent you from changing your home. It doesn't prevent you from adding in addition. She just told me the testimony that she doesn't. But you don't. You just have to go through the permitting process like everybody else. There are certain guidelines that you've got to go through. You can put retaining walls up. The Denver Hill is not a historic it's not a means for that and that makes. That makes sense to me. You can still do it. Use. If you had the designation, that can be done. But at the end of the day, the sky is not falling. Your home is a valued home. You live in a valued neighborhood. Excuse me. Excuse me. The other thing I don't like is rudeness. When we're trying to express. Yeah, let's. Let's not engage each other. Let's do it. That's going to lead me to believe. And I'm going to finally cast that. I was so on the fence. I'm going to support this. Thank you. Okay. Councilman Clark. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to quickly say thank you for sticking out. It's almost 1:00 in the morning. Thank you for being here, taking time to add your voice to this conversation, be. A part of this process. I'm going to say again, because I think it's worth saying in today's day and age. Thank you for the civility that you have shown for each other. And I hope that October 1st over. In your neighborhood is awesome despite all of this. And we need more of that in the world right now. These are these are really hard the growth that Denver. Is facing right now. 40 new people a day. It's really hard. And the issues that come up in this, they're not as. Easy as landmark or not landmark. You know, we just start digging into sustainability. And as a city, when we really get what we're throwing in the landfill, you know, those. It gets into, it gets really complex really quickly. And I won't. Dove off any more than that just to say, you know, what we're all facing as a city across the board are really complex issues and they need productive dialog. And and that doesn't mean that everybody gets to be happy at the end of the day. Right. But that we will be better for the dialog. I really wish that there was a better. Process for us to know who is for and against. I think this has brought into sharp clarity and I know that's not. One of the criteria. But it is something that we consider. And so I'm just throwing out there to my colleagues that I think we need to maybe look at a process on our website for future of these. So that we can have some standardized. Form for people to make their opinions heard. You know, at the end of the day. It's late. All you really care about is, is what? Where am I on this? I'm satisfied that. This district meets the criteria. I have been one of the people pushing against individual. Hostile designation. Of of individual properties and towards. Looking at communities. And neighborhoods. And I think that this does exactly that. And so I appreciate the dialog. I appreciate everyone participating. I will be supporting this tonight. Thank you for coming out and being here. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, president pro tem councilman who? Thank you, Mr. President. I represent District ten, and I have the highest percentage of historic districts in the entire city. I probably got the whole 4%, but, you know, I got such incredible neighborhoods from Cheesman Park, Capitol Hill, Congress for Country Club alum, obviously, and is such a variety. I mean, I got the high end country club that loves their historic district as much as the moderate priced Alamo pursuit of the Mr. Halperin mentioned. You know and I have they all I get is overwhelming support for us and for their district because it protects their character. Their district has a unique, established character and it does deter development that changes character. There's no question in my mind about that. So I really feel also that that it this this application does meet the criteria. And just from my experience with historic districts in my district, I know it'll be successful and I'll be supporting that tonight . Thank you. Thank you. Councilman new Councilwoman Gilmore. And thank you, President Brooks. You know, I have to appreciate all. Of you being here and that really this is a tale of two Danvers sitting here and listening to your testimony and for 5 hours and really hearing the hurt feelings and the pain that was expressed. And at certain points, though, there was laughter and it was light hearted. And so I hope whatever the outcome is by the vote tonight, you hold on to that, because without that, you don't want to live where you don't want to talk to your neighbor next door and you immediately shut your door and you go inside because of something that has happened. And and so. You know, it was painful for me, honestly, sitting here and watching kind of the back and forth. Yeah, I didn't get too bad. But I'm sure the looks and the back and forth, there's some healing that needs to go on. And so I do I hope that October. 1st event is the beginning of a first step for it. But, you know, you shared with us how drastically your neighborhood is changing. And we know that your neighborhood is changing drastically. And I understand your desire to protect your neighborhood. I hope that through a different mechanism, a conservation overlay or some other mechanism, you can protect your neighborhood. Because I also hear the residents who want to have the opportunity to stay in your neighborhood and raise their families, just like I'm sure many of you have already done. And then looking as well at the staff report, you know, really there were five addresses for five individuals. The other two I didn't have an address associated with. So at the end of the day. We're trying to base an entire historic district upon. Five individuals who lived in the District two that may have and then an and. Substantiated number of women who were fabulous, amazing leaders. That's a really hard. I would have loved to had. More. Statistics more data to back up. A yes vote on this designation. The other piece that troubles me is either from CPD's report where 88 residents were non-responsive or from Mr. O'Connell's data that 47 residents were undecided. That's a huge number. That's significant. And Ms.. Let me get her name. Ms.. De Hanes. She was one of the first speakers, and I really thought that we were going to hear a lot from young. Families. Who really wanted to invest in the neighborhood. And I am so grateful that the first person who brought up affordable housing and maintaining a neighborhood that could be inclusive was one of our elders and a senior who has lived in her home for 33 years, and she's 82 years old. I have to think about what's going to happen to the folks who, for whatever reason. Do not have the bandwidth or the time to be here at City Council at 12:51 a.m. to be part of this process. I feel like there's a huge voice that we haven't heard. And I need to honor that voice as well. And so I, based on that, will be voting against it with the sincere hope that you can regroup and come back together and figure out a way forward. Because your community, just all of you being here together, you've got so much to work for. And so I hope that that will be the next steps. Thank you, President Brooks. Thank you, Councilwoman Gilmore. Councilman Cashman. Thank you, Mr. President. I think it's absolutely embarrassing that we don't have an accurate number to the exact address of how many pro's, how many cards and how many didn't respond. For the past few days I've been saying it's a toss up and that's what I believe it is. I think your neighborhood is divided and it's a toss up, but as a city. I'm mortified that that. I just need to challenge the administration to join with council in correcting this. We we passed TIFF after TIFF to a tax increment financing to stimulate a new development. But we don't have a fund of any sort to assist in historic preservation. I mean, we're talking a good game, but I'm not seeing it in ordinance to support the talk. When I walked through this neighborhood and I see some of my tour givers in the audience. Thank you for that. I walked away thinking this is absolutely a neighborhood that deserves to be preserved. It absolutely does. As far as. You know, I see articles getting passed around that historic preservation leads to gentrification. I'm with Brother Lopez. If that's the argument, you want to hang your hat on, Denver's gentrifying. I'm not seeing any evidence that anything that we are doing or can do is going to stop that. Okay. And I'm torn. And for those who have brought up crash on a park, it was 89.4% above 90, what, 95 or what 92? And it was it was a comparatively way more simple situation. There is one form of architecture. With probably 90 some percent undisturbed the current day. So. You know, I'll decide my vote in the next minute and a half. Thank you, Mr. President. You're going to have a little bit more time with that, Councilman Catherine. Councilwoman Ortega. Thank you, Mr. President. So I live in North and I experience exactly what you all are going through. Every day I get notices on my door and in my mail offering to just take my home as is. Because if they can assemble just a couple of properties, then, you know, it's the next big box coming into my neighborhood, which has changed very, very drastically. I mean, drive through Jefferson Park, there's very little semblance of what used to exist in Jefferson Park. People who come to Denver that haven't been here in a while drive through and say, what happened to the neighborhood? You know, some people think it's good. Others think we need to protect what we have here today. Denver has always been known for our great neighborhoods. But you know what? Today, every neighborhood feels like they're on the chopping block. Right. I mean, across the city as I am around the entire city, this is the one complaint that people are concerned about. When we did Blueprint Denver, it was to look at the edges of neighborhoods. But when we start, you know, getting rezoning applications that come in, that are looking at how how can we, you know, justify a project coming into the fabric of the single family neighborhood? The fact that the edges started to develop are used as justifying circumstances for the next rezone that starts, you know, that domino effect. Now, you know, in your neighborhood where you have our two zoning, that's where you've seen single family homes scrape. It's part of why we don't have affordable housing in this city anymore. And we need to really step up our efforts. You know, $15 million is is a significant contribution. And I want to thank my colleagues, Councilwoman Kenney and Councilman Brooks, for bringing that forward. But it's a drop in the bucket compared to what it cost to build, you know, units and affordability and maintain the diversity that this city has enjoyed for so long. I mean, it's it's disappearing. The entire socioeconomic diversity of this city is is drastically changing. I was involved in the Baker historic district. Directly involved in the lower downtown historic district and the Potter Highlands historic districts. Those neighborhoods all saw significant increases in their property values once those historic districts were in place way before the city started changing and gentrifying many of our our neighborhoods. I think the property value impact is the least of the worries that any of you will have to be concerned about. If this district passes tonight. I think our neighborhoods are worth preserving the beauty of our neighborhoods, the quaint character of them. And it takes a lot of work to bring these applications forward. And, you know, I appreciate all of the communications that I received both for and against. I did take the time to go out and walk and tour the neighborhood. My sister grew up just a couple of blocks south of this area. She was on the south side of 32nd Avenue. So, you know, my adult life, I've been in this part of town and, you know, we're we're seeing it change pretty drastically. And I think if you all really love your neighborhood, this is this is the tool that will make a difference. You know, you can you can wait for a conservation overlay that's going to, you know, put things back, maybe another, you know, eight months or so. You heard Councilwoman Sussman talk about the fact that she's asked CPD to help look at this issue. Well, we still don't have that right. Not just for this neighborhood, but for any of our neighborhoods. And so the reality is. This tool can make a difference today for those of you who are interested in preserving your neighborhood. Does that mean it's going to be a little more challenging to do some things? Yeah, but you know what? If you need to get a permit to do your roof or to add an addition, you still have to go through a city process. It's not like you get to go out and just build whatever you want to build. You have to go through a process. The landmark preservation process is just an additional step that makes sure you're in conformity with what the rest of your neighborhood looks like. You have a quaint and beautiful neighborhood, and I think it's worth preserving. The only last thing I want to say is Councilman Lopez's example of his fence. You know, is is is an example of the steps that we all have to go through when we want to do improvements to our homes. And like I said, this just adds a different a different step to go through. Kara outlined what that entails. And I would just say that for those of you who are. Really in opposition to this. When we had the lower downtown historic district brought forward, we had a two year review every two years for six years. And at the end of six years, it was going to sunset. At the end of the second. Two year review, the entire community came forward unified, saying, please remove the sunset. This is working. We had you know, we had reservations about it, but they were grateful to have that historic district in place. And you see what it is today. Yes. It's one of the most unaffordable neighborhoods in our city. Right. But it it created stability in the downtown area. And it it attracted the investment of so much of what exists there today, including everything else that has happened on the back side, where the train station and all all the rest of that development is. So I will be supporting this tonight. And again, I appreciate the input from everybody. I respect the opinions on all sides. But I think your neighborhoods are worth preserving and I'm going to support it tonight. Thank you. All right. Thanks, Councilwoman Ortega. Councilwoman Kennish. Thank you to everyone for a really thoughtful conversation tonight. And as usual, we've tripped beyond the immediate question before as to the bigger issues. And I think my colleagues have identified a number of ways and reasons why we have tradeoffs. When we live in communities. We don't just have private property with pure, unadulterated decision making by the owner, but we have all kinds of tradeoffs that we make. And those tradeoffs aren't just about the person who lives in that particular property. So, for example, no one probably wants to live on a busy street, but if we didn't have some busy streets in Denver and someone didn't live on them, then no one would be able to get to and from work or to and from school or to and from the store. And so there are all kinds of ways where as decision makers in government, we're in the position of thinking about, you know, the the greater good and the entire community. That doesn't mean that it's not really important what the tradeoffs are for the people who are impacted most. However, and so tonight we heard a lot, and I think a lot of my colleagues are giving a lot of weight to these numbers about, you know, how many are in favor and how many are opposed. And I think that I think one of the speakers was correct when they identified that the ordinance isn't neutral in the ordinance, isn't about counting. You know, we often I often get emails from constituents who don't like the idea of government that governs by Paul. Right. And so the question becomes, what's this ordinance about? And this ordinance isn't neutral. It's about what will future generations judge about what we have conserved in the city. And that's a higher accountability. So I have to weigh the impact to folks today with this broader. Mandate, if you will, this broader question. And so when I have residents across the city stopping me in grocery stores and parks and on the street saying, what can we do because we're afraid we're losing something special, this is one of the things we can do. And I have so much respect for my colleagues and their optimism about the fact that there's going to be an easy way. But, you know, I don't know what the outcome the final, final outcome of Park Hill will be, but I will know this, that an overlay district does not prevent demolition. And so I don't know and what will be agreed to. And two, I don't know what will or won't be demolished after that agreement is made. But I think that it may not be that there's an easy way to do this. It may not be that there's an easy way that you can say we're going to preserve important pieces of this city's history and that that's always going to be consensus and that there's always a path for that. I think sometimes there's a hard decision at the end of the roads that we govern on, and I think we're at the end of one of those roads where there is a really hard decision. And so I think many of the things that were said tonight by both sides could be true. At the same time, I think it's true that there's many approvals that folks go through for landmarks that are simple and that are quick. And I think it's also true that there may be some things that aren't going to be possible on people's parcels. Both those things can be true. So if we're not counting votes in terms of saying, you know, that's not what my mandate is, my mandate is to say, does something meet the criteria and does it meet the test of history to say that we've done our best to balance these things? Then the question goes to the criteria, and I do share some of the frustration my colleague, Councilwoman Gilmore, had. The testimony didn't focus quite as much on the criteria as I would have liked it to, but the record is actually much fuller than the testimony we had tonight. And I think it's really important just to identify that there are more criteria than we've talked about from this dais. Right. So retirement properties more than 30 years old, we're talking about an entire historic context. Right. And so that has been really well established. We're talking about the integrity. Right, that has been established. So each of these criteria was touched on, but we kind of got hung up, I think, on the name list. But the historical significance, right, in terms of, you know, not every neighborhood has this history of, you know, the the prominence of the temperance movement and the highlands as the place to escape the sin of the city and then the annexation and the back and forth. A lot of that is covered in the written record that wasn't discussed here as as in as much detail as might have been helpful for some of us architectural significance. Right. I mean, sometimes these things, we can overthink them, right? But it's like if you walk this and you see you can see the Queen Anne's have significance, right? There is something about them that you wouldn't see in any neighborhood across any state, right at any time in history. There was a period whereas I can see a house with siding and, you know, things that may be an architectural style, but it's not going to be. I can't point specifically to one place that it is or one time. And so I think that all of those criteria have been met. And I think that when residents say to me, what is it that we can do to preserve the feel and the nature of this community? This is one of those things, and I think there is adequate community support here for this decision. I have the utmost respect and I don't take I think this is the toughest balance, right, compared to traffic and compared to height and compared to all the other tough tradeoffs. And I voted against the proponents of this application many times and density because I think they were wrong about their ability to stop change, because I think there is a need for density and growth in the city, but not always and not where we have all of these historic criteria that have been met. And so so I think that so with the greatest respect for the gravity of the decision, because that's what it is. And I don't go home sleeping great and easily after these decisions, but I got it. I got to meet the test of the ordinance and I wouldn't be supportive of changing this ordinance to make it neutral because in my view it is about protecting the history that is its goal and that's what it's got to be aimed at. Otherwise it's got no purpose. If it's just to mediate between two parties, we can send you all to mediation. We don't need an ordinance for that. The ordinance is about the history. And so with the criteria being met and weighing all of that, I do need to support this application tonight regardless of how the vote turns out, and I hope the dialog continues about other methods where that's possible. But the protection from demolition is unique here. And I got to weigh that. Thank you. Councilwoman. Thank you, Councilman Flynn. Thank you, Mr. President. Emblematic, I think of the deep division. In the community. I kept a spreadsheet up here of everybody who spoke. And I just the accident of who left and who didn't get to speak. We ended up with 23 parcels in testifying in favor and two owners of 23 parcels testifying against it. I just want to point that out. So it's evenly split 5050 just because of who stayed and who left, I suppose. I don't share the the level of confidence that Councilwoman each expresses in the in the criteria being met because of some of the things I brought up in questioning about direct association and distinguishing characteristics and significant work of recognized architects and builders, especially when two of the three structures of 173 already are landmarked. And so that does give me pause. I want to recognize the hard work that went into it on on the advocates side. I, too, took the tour that was offered. And it struck me that this is this is a sort of a different kind of district. The last one that we did, in fact, the only one that I was able to vote on in my time here was last year with the South. South Lincoln Street. It's there was a district that was sort of this was uniform characteristic here in in Packard's hill. We have many, many different types. It sort of defies classifying it as queen and or or or any other type of, you know, craftsman or terrorists. And it seems to me very, very different from some of the other districts that I have seen, and especially the last one that we voted on. And so I'm sitting here going back and forth like my friend Councilman Cashman, all through the evening, back and forth, not knowing where where to land on this. But I do have to say, at the end of the day, because of the deep division in the community, I really believe that this needs more consensus. And so I believe I have to oppose this. Thank you. All right. I'm the last speaker. Thank you, guys, for for coming through security, parking your car, refill in your parking meters. If you didn't do it, you've got to take it. We can't take care of it. Sorry. Thank you all for being here. You guys have actually been great. And I will say this is one of the probably one of the most contentious votes that but at the same time, the the the spirit has been jovial. And I think that's going to be important for your neighborhood in the future. I am you know, I don't want to repeat anything. I think the council members in here really embody a lot of what I've been thinking. I'm really frustrated at the. At the number of individuals who are in opposition, not for at you, but, you know, I'd love to see some something much more supportive as as I was talking to, you know, some of the proposers early on, I thought there would be a lot more support. And I don't know what happened. It's not clear to me, you know. QUESTION The council councilperson, who is is the leader in this district, questioned some of the proposers. QUESTION Some of you are it's still not clear to me what would happen. I know that Councilwoman Kenney, which, you know, kind of is saying that, you know, this isn't kind of the most important thing, but it's critical for me. It is critical for me because, you know, one of the reasons I'm such a strong proponent for districts is the evolution of the process that happens in the community process. That's the transformative piece. And I see it happening in my district all the time. And so that's why I'm quite frustrated. I will say this. In 2011. We really wanted to get revitalization going on five points in Walton and in five points in Wellington as a five block area. That is Landmark District. And there was one individual. Me. Who said let's? Let's let's do away with it. Let's deal with the district because no one is going to come and redevelop in five points on Walton. We hadn't had development since the light rail line. It would have been one of the biggest mistakes of. I think my time on city council today, we have over $400 million of redevelopment and it's all in that area of the Landmark District, and it's probably one of the most condensed redevelopment areas except for Brighton Boulevard right now. And when we begin to look at the long term future of historic districts and landmark districts. These are the districts that can protect these incredible economic times when not everybody should be developing. Let's just be honest. And calls that preservation in the community. I see it. I see it every day. I represent the economic engine of the city. And now these districts have not deterred any development at all. Curtis Park. Whelton. All of this is what I represent and I walk in on a daily basis now. Wilson is more commercial, but Curtis Park is mostly residential and really encourage a lot of folks to take a walk through their pop tops. People going in the back, people don't. You guys can't do ads. People don't have to use all of that. With design review. Yes, it is more complex. Yes, it is. Let's not. Talk like it's not, however, at the end of the day. All the residents in my constituency say. Our neighborhood is better for it. And I couldn't get around it. That's what I'm looking at in my support of this. I am struggling big time because of the number of people I see, the number of folks who spoke and articulate it. But at the end of the day, when we look in the future of what we want our city to be, this is the thing that that begins to protect it. So I'll be supporting this. Madam Secretary, Rocco Espinosa. I.

And I'm going to turn it over to Marva Sheehan with H.f. and each to walk you through that process and the results. And at the end of Marv's presentation, Marva Staff Ken, Kenny, Criswell, Busa and the team will be available for any questions that you may have. Thank you. Hello there. Good evening. At a mayor and council, Marva Sheehan partnered nature consultants. And I've been here for several years now. So every year or just first, we start with RCI, which provides your recycling solid waste and organics collection in the city for your residents, residences, businesses. And part of that agreement that is with the city is a rate setting process. And there are two methods that we use the index best method, which is every two years and then every third year is a detailed cost review. And this year was the year that we did the detailed cost review and we look at their actual cost and then come up with what we feel that are tied in with the requirements per the agreement and then compare that with estimated revenues and come up with the estimated or with the projected rate adjustment. At the conclusion of our report this year and after our work week came, that is a 7.31% increase. After discussions with staff and with RCI, we ended up deciding to use part of the Rate Stabilization Fund, which you had been accumulating each year, as well as funds from their bouncing account, which had our recycling revenues have been going into that fund. So this was a time to start using that. And then also in discussions with RCI on adjusting some of the cost in order to get to the number that we ended up with, that it ends up that the rates are going would be going up 4.21%, which is about what CPI had been. So it kind of ties in with that as well. With with that, there's a quarterly impact to the 32 gallon rate, which is the majority of your ratepayers of about $5, $20 for the year. So pretty insignificant when you think in terms of the amount of services and what your residents and businesses are receiving here. And as far as in comparison with the county, we had a rate survey that was part of your packet and you're still in a really good position again considering the level of service that you are receiving. And with that, I'll answer any questions that you have. So Counsel, do we have any questions? Councilmember Odie. I. Have a couple of. Thank you. So who did the heavy lifting on the negotiation? Do we know what that was? Who did you know. Who did the heavy lifting on on saving us from 7.3 to 4.3. Liam in our office worked with a C.I. on that. On that. Okay. So kudos to that person or persons. I just have a question. I'm just a little quick prefix. Preface, preface. Sorry, it's getting late. I'm on the Stop Waste Board and there was some discussion here in the staff report on Operation National Sword, and I know that's putting a lot of pressure on recycling and recycling rates. And I think there's some new regulation that came down, you know, from the state. Can we can somebody just talk a little bit about. Sure, I'll talk a bit on the recycling, then I'll let Kent talk, give you a little more from the company's perspective. Our our firm has been working with a lot different agencies dealing with National Sword and. Just audience members who may be listening. Do you want to explain that? That's kind of what I was hoping that we can. You know, because absolutely, you know, those of. Us in Stop Waste hear it. And by the way, Maria's here, she stuffs that with me and very excellent. So I just give a quick shout out to Maria. Great. So China back really at the end of 2017 put out basically that they were going to restrict the the types of materials that were they were going to be taking in part of China's efforts on clean air environment issues. So they implemented what we called National Sword. That's kind of the U.S. term for it. That went into effect March of 2018. That limited the types of materials they take. The probably more importantly is they set a standard for contamination and that it goes down to the point 5%, which is very, very small as far as contamination levels. Most I'm not sure there's a Merv that can really meet that level. So what happened is, as a result, material didn't go to China and therefore they had to find alternative markets. Last year when we were here, we were just right. Really in the early brinks of it, there was concerns about even finding places for the materials to go. And there was a thought of if people were going to have to landfill, what was going to happen to especially this is all predominately mixed paper and also in mixed paper. It only has a certain shelf life before it starts disintegrating. So there was lots of issues last spring and summer. Through that time they've kind of worked through, for the most part, materials. Being able to be moved is just that. The price where at one point they were getting over $100 a ton for it is now and I think can you can talk to it it's break even or having to pay a month ago I think they were paying $11 or so attempting to move it. It's going now to places like Pakistan and Vietnam and other sources, but they weren't set up for the amount of material to get there. And then part of the issue was, well, which was one that I hadn't thought of. There was we have a lot of ships coming this way from China with material. And so back hauling to China, getting load that way was fairly easy going to these other countries. We didn't have the same level of ship. So there was you might have a purchase order to get there, but you didn't you couldn't get containers in or ship to be able to get it there. So there was a lot that's been going on with that. But the biggest thing is the fact that the pricing on paper and cardboard has dropped dramatically. And so the and for you, your commodity revenue share went into this balancing account. So it hasn't impacted the rates as much at this point. But for a lot of agencies where they netted the revenues against the cost to process, it's coming back quite a bit. You want to give the companies perspective, okay. What's important? Let people know this because we're recycling more and more. And I think we should understand that, you know, there's some pressures, but we still want to keep doing it. Mayor Council My name is Ken Kenny. I'm the controller with HCI. The recycling market's really I'd sum up as spot market prices are very, very depressed. It's going to take a long time for them to recover. Again, as Marva said, the markets are shifting dramatically and it's just not the same as when China was taking the material . You know, again, $150 a ton for makes paper. Which was the. Bulk of the recycling that was being moved. Now we're at times paying to to move the material. The good news is we are moving material. We've not had to landfill anything. And we believe. We will continue to move material and it will just take a long time for the markets to mature and get back. The contamination issues mean we have to do more work to clean up the quality, to make the material marketable. And with that, that's really what it is, a spot market day to day, and it's going to take a long time to recover from that thing. Thank you. Thanks. Okay. Counsel, ready? Any further questions? I mean, is there any, you know, any long term policy implications of all of this that we need to consider as we go forward in our in our contracts? And I remember Oakland just, you know, sent out a bit maybe two or three years ago and there was a big sticker shock. Right. So I mean. Well, I think, you know, new contracts, what we're seeing now were for there were years ago contracts you got there's kind of a net revenue back to the city in a revenue share. It might be 20 or $25 a ton would come back to the city. That's obviously is gone. And then the contracts kind of went to a net zero where it said, okay, holla processor, you better risk reward, it's all yours. Now really what we're seeing is establishing a processing fee and looking at the revenue kind of separate and having kind of parameters and ways of how you're calculating at which you got your contract is kind of like that. You have a processing fee and you have a revenue share, so you're really kind of set ahead of the game from a lot of contracts. But that's really I think the key is, if I could stress anything to the residents is, you know, clean, keeping your materials clean that you'll get those those containers that clean and dry and then not keeping garbage out of the recycling is probably the best message that we could send in order to, because no matter what, the material's going to be clean. Thank you. Good advice. Okay. Councilmember Daisuke. Hi. Thank you for the report. By the way, I always like reading it. It's so very detailed and transparent, the way in which information is packaged and conveyed. The question that I have tonight is several days ago we council received an email about a resident concerned about theft of from blue bins, the recycling bins. So the question I have is, has RCI or the city quantified the amount of dollars we lose when recyclables are taken out of the blue bins by what I shall call street recycling entrepreneurs? So do we cause for? With regard to the impacts of changes in policy by the People's Republic of China, you seem to have quantified that impact on a something on the order of $25 a ton resulting from from China's change in policy. But when it comes to theft the is from from the blue bins do we know. Yeah. I'll have to defer to ECI and staff on that. I know from my background it's a very difficult number to capture because it's kind of you don't know what you don't know, but I'll defer to them. Okay. Good evening, Madam Mayor. Members of the Council. Chris Melville, General Manager of ECI. Councilmember Desai. Specifically, we haven't done our quantitative analysis to understand the specific amount of revenue loss from these items, but they're typically the more valuable items the petty, the aluminum things that can be turned into the redemption centers for money. So it is a direct offset in revenue. That would be interesting to understand what the impact is on rates. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure to ask that question. Okay. I would like to also circle back real quick to Councilmember Ortiz question about contract elements that could have an impact on long term recycling costs and so forth. And one of the things to keep in mind right now is that recycling capacity is quite a valuable element, and you have three years or so left on this franchise agreement. And so as communities contemplate what's happening long term, it's important to consider if you want to have discussions about ramping up recycling capacity on a longer basis of something could be done now. It could impact or could have the effect of a rate smoothing effect. So you're not seeing these large jumps in future years. Thank you. Any further questions. For the controller? Yeah. I'm sorry. Jim. Mr. Judy. Sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay. I think there were I also had a question about I think there were two bills that passed in Sacramento. I mean, just so the public is informed on what those are. Maybe you could just touch on those briefly, the impact. Sure. There are actually several, maybe 32, maybe 341. The most recent coming into full effect right now is HB 1383, which passed. It's actually a climate pollutant bill of greenhouse gas reductions, but has a significant element on, um, composting and food scraps. Recycling and things like that, has a tremendous amount of regulation attached to it that will have cost impacts associated with service. But again, we're happy to talk to the city and work through those things to lessen those impacts as much as possible. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Do we have any public comment? We do not have any speakers. Okay. Any further discussion? One more question. Councilmember de Desai. In the HFA report on page 14, at the very top there is a discussion there about profits and it reads as follows We found that ECI correctly calculated the allowable profit by applying a 90% operating ratio, i.e. approximately a 10% profit to its allowable operating cost. However, due to the calculated adjustments described above, we recommend an $88,800 decrease to Acres profit. So was that recommendation is that built into the the the the profit? I mean, the rate changes that we're contemplating? Absolutely. Okay. It's all it's basically a mathematical the first part, because we take their operating costs and calculate the profit, because we reduce their costs, that associated profit gets subtracted as well. So it ends up netting out. Yes. Okay. So it's okay. I was just responding to the word recommend. So I was wondering if it was not only recommended, but. It's included in the in the recommended way to just. Make you question. Any further counsel comments or questions. Okay. So what we're looking for is an adoption of a resolution establishing integrated waste collection ceiling rates and service fees for Alameda County Industries for period 18, which is July 2019 to June 2020. Do I have a motion to adopt this resolution? So moved. I have a motion to have a second. It's been moved by Vice Mayor Knox. Right. Seconded by Councilmember de Sung. May we have a voice vote, please? Yes. Councilman DeSantis? Yes. Knox White. Yes. Yes. Yes. Mayor. As Ashcraft. Yes. Okay. That carries the motion passes unanimously. The resolution is adopted. Thank you, everyone. All right. Moving on down the agenda. We are on agenda item six e.

This item is a short term rental proposed modifications. I'd like to turn it over to staff. Linda Tatum. I'd like to introduce I like to introduce the planning manager. Patricia Defender for to make a brief. Staff presentation on this item. You do so much. And good evening, members of the city council. Patricia, Defender for Planning Bureau Manager. Can you hear me okay? Yes. Okay, great. This item before you is the approval of a California Coastal Commission, modifications to the city's short term rentals ordinance that was adopted by the City Council in late 2020. The Coastal Commission modifications do not materially change the ordinance as proposed as approved by City Council. They do not change the overall cap on UNHOSTED units citywide and generally represent procedural changes that pertain to properties in the coastal zone, which I will describe in more detail in later slides. Next slide, please. Next slide, please. Thank you. Following is a brief history of this ordinance. On June 23rd, 2020, the ordinance to add Chapter 5.77 to the municipal code to regulate short term rentals was approved at that time, only hosted short term rentals were permitted under that ordinance. Subsequently, in December of 2020, the City Council adopted modifications to the original ordinance that allowed Unhosted short term rentals. On September 4th, 2020, and again on December 30th, 2020, the city submitted the short term rental ordinance and the revised ordinance to the California Coastal Commission, which requires an amendment to the city's adopted local coastal program. The local coastal program is comprised of the Land Use Plan and the implementation program, which are the ordinances that implement the the the land use plan. The implementation program is generally comprised of Title 21 Zoning Code and Title 22 subdivision code of the City's Municipal Code. And amendments to these chapters of the Municipal Code require approval and certification by the Coastal Commission in order to be effective in the city's coastal zone. The OCR, for those in the short term rentals ordinance, is a section in the Title 25 of the Municipal Code, which regulates businesses in the city. Given the overlap between regulating the short term rentals and land use and the Coastal Commission's authority to ensure access to the coast, the short term rentals ordinance similarly requires review and certification by the Coastal Commission and will be incorporated in the city's certified local coastal program. On December 15th, 2021, the Coastal Commission held a hearing on the local Coastal Program Amendment and required for modifications, the approval of which are before the City Council this evening. Next slide, please. Procedurally, the city has six months from the Coastal Commission's December action to adopt these modifications and resubmit the revised ordinance to the Coastal Commission for Final Certification. Once those steps are complete, the short term rental ordinance will be effective in the coastal zone. Next slide, please. Following is a summary of the modifications that are proposed. The first modification is the requirement for that a 350 non primary unhosted number of short term rentals be maintained in the coastal zone in order to maintain a level of short term rentals similar to those historic levels of short term run short term rentals that were in the coastal zone. As previously mentioned, the Coastal Commission action does not change the fees adopted citywide cap of 800 unhosted short term rentals and the Coastal Commission modification does clarify that the citywide cap cannot be used to limit the number of short term rentals in the coastal zone to less than 350. However, the city will be monitoring the 800 unit cap, including through a requirement to provide an annual report to the City Council and South will come back to the City Council if it appears that the city will exceed the cap. The second modification any prohibitions on short term rentals, either buildings or centers, block groups in the coastal zone would be required to obtain a local coastal development permit, and findings in support of those requirements have to be met, and I will describe those findings in a later slide. This is the main procedural change that will result from these modifications. The third modification establishes a periodic review by the Coastal Commission of Restrictions on short term rentals that are approved by the city to ensure that there are no cumulative impacts to public access to the coast. Finally, the fourth and last modification pertains to a commitment to non discriminatory services and ADA access as part of the registration process to maximize public access for all people. Next slide, please. The next few slides provide some sample scenarios related to the restrictions to short term rentals that are intended to be allowed by the short term rental ordinance. The ordinance does provide the ability of property owners to initiate a petition process to prohibit short term rentals within a census block group, to compare the current process with the process that would result from the proposed Coastal Commission modifications. Currently, the ordinance would require the property owner to complete a successful petition process and then be added on the list of restricted areas. With the proposed ordinance modifications, property owners will have to complete a successful petition process as they would under the current ordinance, that they would also have to obtain a local coastal development permit. If the findings can be made in the positive and the local coastal development permit is approved, then they will be added to the list of restricted areas for unhosted short term rentals. Next slide, please. Similarly, procedures would apply in order for individual buildings to be added to the list of prohibited buildings in which unhosted short term rentals are prohibited. The current ordinance would require the property owner to apply to be on the prohibited buildings list and then once on the list, the short term rental restriction would be enforced. With the proposed ordinance modifications, property owners will have to apply to be listed on the prohibited buildings list. They would then be required to obtain a local coastal development permit, which does require a hearing. If the findings can be made in the positive and the local coastal development permit is approved, then they will be added to the list of prohibited buildings and that in the short term, rental restriction will be enforced. Buildings that have restricted affordable units, which are not eligible to be short term rentals, as well as buildings with restrictive covenants that prohibit short term rentals or their equivalent dating back to before January 1st, 1977, and which pre-date the Coastal Act, would be exempt from this procedure and may be listed on the prohibited buildings list without the procedure. Next slide, please. Shown on this slide are the findings that would have to be made to grant the local coastal development permit to restrict short term rentals in the census block group group, or to place a building on the prohibited buildings list. The proposed modifications so you can see the restriction would be there would be findings that they would not include a cumulative impact to access to short term rentals and access to the coast for habitat restrictions would not result in substantial loss of visitor serving accommodations. They would not result in the loss of lower cost overnight accommodations. The proposed restrictions would not result in the net loss of short term, short term rentals. Below 425 short term rentals, which is comprised of both hosted and unhosted short term rentals, which are historic, which historically occur in the coastal zone, and the proposed restriction would not would be necessary to protect the neighborhood's stability. So these are the findings that would have to be made in order to approve the restrictions on short term rentals. Next slide, please. So these are the next steps that are required upon City Council approval. City staff will resubmit the revisions to the California Coastal Commission within the six months in order to meet the timeframes required by law. The Coastal Commission will then certify and ensure that the amendment is consistent with the original action of the Coastal Commission and that upon certification, the ACR ordinance will be in effect in the coastal zone . Next slide, please. The recommendation is that the city council accepts the California Coastal Commission, propose modifications and finalized the Coastal Commission certification process for the ACR ordinance as an amendment to the local coastal program. That concludes staff recommendation and staff is available to answer any questions that the Council might have. Thank you. I think we should stick with the council. We do have a motion from our Councilmember Price, seconded by Councilmember Jurado, and we do have some comment from council, but with I think we should go to public comment first, if that's okay. I'd like to do that. They're okay with the maker of the motion. Okay. Clark is a Republican. If there are any members of the public that would like to speak on this item, please use the raise hand feature or Dallas Star nine. Daniel Wilson. Your time begins now. You have 90 seconds. Good evening, Honorable Council members. My name is Daniel Wilson and I'm speaking on behalf of Unite your Local 11. Tonight, you have a rare opportunity amid an unprecedented global crisis that has wrecked your tourism industry. And as the city faces down a mandate to build nearly 27,000 units of housing over the next eight years, you can start bleeding your existing housing stock by encouraging them to be converted into party houses and luxury tourist rentals. We do not agree with the staff's presentation of this language that it would not increase the cap. That is absolutely not correct. We urge you tonight to reject the Coastal Commission's changes to your ordinance that allow 1150 units of housing to be converted into short term rentals. FDR are an existential threat to hotel workers. They take housing away from working people and displaced their jobs. At the last council meeting, this council unanimously stated that hotel and janitorial workers jobs are a priority by passing recall and retention. This week, you are considering whether to allow those same hotel workers jobs to be taken away by the short term rental market. This is the Uber, Lyft and Amazon of our industry. Please stand with the hard, hardworking hotel workers who build your tourism economy by rejecting these changes today and adopt a primary residence requirement to stop the. Bleeding of the city's housing stock. Thank you. Next speaker, we have Nancy Hannah. Your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. My name is Nancy Hanna. I am an attorney, and I work with better neighbors, L.A. and the city council should reject. The commission suggested modifications to expand the cap of Unhosted non primary non primary residences and dedicated short term rental properties. The short term rental ordinance was originally passed by Long Beach, had a cap of 800 units that would be allowed to be taken off the market and dedicated short term rentals. And now they're considering extending that cap by 43% to allow it to increase to 1150. I categorically disagree with the staff characterization of this modification, saying that they will not increase the cap. The plain language of the proposed modification does exactly that. I heard the staff say that they intend to monitor the cap, although it is very clear there is no plan for what to do if we reach a point that there is a registration beyond 800 as Long Beach going to start kicking out registered users or how will you claw back that cap? Also, please keep in mind that this monitoring and any response to it is not included in the language of these modifications or this ordinance. And so, in effect, this is just a placebo. And the actual language that the city council today is considering adopting is to increase the number of housing units that will be taken off of the housing market. Thank you. Next speaker, we have Rockwell Lezama. Rick. How? See, when I started this production. De la France, I bought France. They were interpreting the color France. When I started at the concert hall. Good afternoon. All the members from the council. I mean, I'm basically summer, so I try to stay out for the assignments. My name is regular. Sam and I have been working in the hotel industry for the last ten years. Then go to their own checker party. I got a migraine, so. I had the need to use a health check and half of the other check in order to cover my rent. Kirkpatrick Yes, my character is still in control. There be trouble. Not only that, rent is very expensive, but it's very difficult for me to find housing close to my job. Yes. To Sarkozy. They can just see apartments, can competition, arbitration, as you say. And that is due to the fact that many homes and apartment rooms have become it became a hotel rentals. Oh, yes. I keep I rapidly up to Apollo. I'm here to ask for your support in order to stop the London. Which are scandalous cambio de la commission cos they run Israeli. And for you to reject the changes made for from the Coastal Commission into the new law. But it also means more destruction. They cost us the apartments, we sell them. So that is the the familiar. We need to stop the destruction of houses and apartments and the elimination of homes for many families. Debi Mazar, similarly Iraqi theater, the residency principal in Ciudad de Los Angeles. So we had to copy the law that Los Angeles have regarding primary residence parameters that they have in Los Angeles. But I put their faith in their success, gets Ben Affleck banned. Also God is the Lord is gracious to. Stop the creation of those hundreds of party houses that are affecting really workers that work in our city. Thank you very much. Next speaker is Leona Noble. Good evening, counsel. I'm speaking on behalf of Billy Bray. And we also ask the council to reject the Coastal Commission recommendations and the recommendation of staff. We strongly disagree that the proposed. Changes won't present a problem for the residents and workers here in the city. Of Long Beach. At the very moment that we continue to see outrageous. Escalations in rents. 32% in my neighborhood. And in other neighborhoods, it's even worse. Those rent increases are going to be escalated if you approve. This increase. In. Airbnbs because you are going to decrease the available rental units. This is also the wrong time, in our opinion, for you to do this, because unfortunately, the federal, the state and the local rent subsidies and assistance being. Provided to our neighbors who. Are renters. Is ending. Literally in a matter. Of weeks. Now is not the time to further destabilize rental housing here in Long Beach. And we ask you to please. Thank you, Susan Bailey. Your time begins. Now. Thank you. Thank you. Members of council. I appreciate the opportunity to speak tonight. I live in Long Beach in the coastal zone at 161 Glendora in Suzy's district. My husband and I split our time between Long Beach and Denver. Our home has never been used as a permanent long term rental. Because we use it more than half the year. And I believe the Coastal. Commission's recommendations. Are thoughtfully considered, have been reviewed, carefully, coexist with all the important forms of lodging, including the hotel lodging industry. Which is equally important. But short term rentals are places that people come and stay in neighborhoods. Near their families. They're typically in different districts, not always in hotel districts. And most importantly, they offer people an opportunity to come with their family, to cook in a kitchen. To have an affordable place to access the coast. And I would urge you to think through the very thoughtful recommendations presented by the Coastal Commission, which I believe are in keeping with council's prior ordinance and actually can coexist quite effectively. Thank you for your time. Next speaker is Araceli King. Your 90 seconds begins now. And even in council tonight, I won't be representing Latinos in action in California. We are. Actually through our organization, you know, on the rejection of the Coastal Commission recommendations of Long Beach Ordinance. 30. Zero zero 34 due to the increase of the rentals that. Are going to be in in here. And also, we have a that the language is increasingly becoming, you know, unaffordable for residents. For visitors who want to enjoy the coastline is fine. But we think that, you know, it's going to take a lot of job and and everything from the people that is going to come and work for the hotels. So we are actually, you know, asking you to please check and verify these things. We work with. Like a lot of the. Community that is working into those areas. We think that we have to think about this and make sure that we are not going to be, you know. Misusing all the when I took the picture. The resources that we have into making our city better. By, you know. Losing a lot of jobs for our own people. Thank you so much for letting me, you know, share what we were thinking about and really appreciate what you guys do. Thank you. Melody Osuna. Your time begins now. Good. Good evening, counsel. And my name is Melody Osuna. I'm an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. I'm also a resident of District eight. We LaFlamme The Legal Aid Foundation, Los Angeles provides technical assistance and legal support to Long Beach tenants and community organizers. And as such, we take a great deal of interest in the affordability of the housing stock in the city. I first want to point out that we disagree with the staff report that. States the changes will not affect the 800 cap. It's simple math. If there are 800 short term rentals outside the coastal zone, this change allows 350 more rentals in the city, reaching 1150 short term rentals. As we shared with the Coastal Commission in December 2021. When it considered Long Beach expansion of short term rentals. In the coastal zone, we believe this ordinance will make. It more. Difficult for low and moderate income residents. Of Long Beach to stay housed within the coastal area. It's well-settled that short term rentals drive up the cost of housing stock for residents. Like other forms of. Gentrification, the effect of short. Term rentals is that they increase the value of an area at. The expense of its residents, many of whom are. Pushed out of their homes and neighborhoods because of rising rents. One, which is already experiencing staggering housing inflation data recently presented by Cal. State Long Beach, shows that rents increased by 5% or more in and most Long Beach. Zip codes. This amounts to more than $100. In extra costs per month. With the city where roughly 60% of the city residents are. Amber, did your 90 seconds begin now? And BURNETT. Your time begins now. Good evening, councilmembers. My name is and Burdette. I am of faith who did organizer with Clue Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice. We strongly oppose the California Coastal Commission proposal that effectively removes 350 more housing units from Long Beach's rental and housing market. The Commission has a duty to protect access to the coast for all California's residents, including. Those living in Long. Beach. And that commitment is not served by expansion of the short term rental market. The question must be where is the attention of commission and of this council centered on tourists or on Long Beach families on providing what are effectively hotel accommodations in the case of unhosted rentals or on providing homes short term rentals. Remove housing for my residents while providing no lasting return for our city. You know, recently this council centered their attention and their votes on supporting the character of Long Beach by unanimously passing right to recall and retention. Ensuring that hotel workers can return to their livelihoods is laudable and forward thinking. But these same residents face the challenge of finding housing near their jobs. In fact, All Long Beach residents face the challenge of living in one of the least affordable cities in the country. So please do not vote to expand the short term rental cap, but rather focus on affordable housing for our Long Beach families. Thank you. Ailsa Chang, your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. Good evening, city council. My name is Ailsa Chang with Long Beach Forward. I mean, I can't agree more with the comments that have already been shared of those that are concerned and opposing the Coastal Commissioners recommendation. Frankly, it's actually quite confusing for the community because we understood that the Coastal Commission generally this was a contentious issue , particularly the 350 units above the 800 cap. And our understanding was that the Coastal Commission narrowly voted that down. So why it appears in the current staff report is very curious. But in any case, I ask you to consider city council. Who is the authority here on Long Beach? Short term rentals. Is it the city council or is it the Coastal Commission? Because the City Council ordinance already said 800 non primary resident short term rental cap, 800 unit cap. That was your decision and your authority yet. Now the Coastal Commission is coming in to say actually no 350 additional units in the coastal zone can be approved. So that means an additional that means a total of 1150. Are you going to let the coastal zone or the Coastal Commission bully the city council? I don't think you should. I think you should stick with what the city council originally passed, which is 800 non primary residents. Short term rentals. That is the cap. Garcia Lopez Reyes. Your 90 seconds begin now. Good evening, ma'am. Members of the council. My name is Chris Reyes, director of Leon Lambert Coalition for Good Jobs and Healthy Communities. We also have serious concerns about the post, the commission's modifications. Colombia Short term rental ordinance, Long Beach limits on hosted ACR to 800 throughout the city. The modification suggests expanding the cap to include an additional 350 UNHOSTED stores in the coastal zone. These proposed modifications could negatively impact renters and working families in Long Beach. This proposal would contribute to the ongoing housing prices that have even increased more during the pandemic. Instead of providing the needed solutions that we need around housing, we urge the Council not to allow these recommendations to weaken your own policy. And as a city council to protect housing by rejecting the Coastal Commission's modifications to the CAP on NCR and by also adopting an additional provision to limit ACR to the primary residence of hosts , as has been done in the city of Los Angeles. Thank you. Our next speaker is John Thompson. Your 90 seconds begin now. Yes, hello. My name is John Thompson. I'm the managing director of the West End here in Long Beach. And I will say that we also disagree with the staff report. We really applaud the recall and retention law that was passed. And we've worked very hard over the last three and four years to ensure that the ladies and gentlemen who work in the tourism industry have a place to come to work and a way to pay their bills. We absolutely urge that the Long Beach City Council today reject the Coastal Commission modifications and keep the number of stores designated at 800 regardless of where they are. Thank you. Our next speaker is Marianne Messina. Mariana Pina and I am a long term resident for over 20 years on the peninsula in District three. I am also a host for my duplex on the peninsula. I am a member and of the Peninsula Neighborhood Association and Alamitos B Garden Club very, very involved in my community here. I please accept the Coastal Commission recommendations that represents years of public input and successfully establishes standards for responsible operation of both home and sharing and vacation rentals. The Coastal Commission recommendations strengthen the ordinance and support affordable accommodations for visitors of coastal Long Beach. Now the recommendations help host with extra income in an expensive coastal region. Host are small neighborhood entrepreneurs who care about Long Beach and their communities. The ordinance introduces controls and limits to hold the host, the guest and the platform accountable. The caps and city registration requirements are in place. Provide lower coastal. Access without compromising neighborhood stability. The ordinance also protects neighborhoods and housing with percentage caps and multi-family developments, and by restricting to one plus one primary residence and one vacation rental per host owner. Please approve and implement the California. Or the Coastal Commission's recommendations. Thank you. Next speaker is Drake Stone. Your 90 seconds begin now. Over. Thanks for allowing me to speak. I don't have a formal speech prepared like some of the other folks. I am a short. Term rental operator. I live in. Long Beach and I live on the coast. I wholeheartedly. Agree with. This proposal. For the reasons actually some of the people have stated earlier. This is the Uber and Lyft of the hospitality industry. And just like those companies, what they have done is they have decentralized wealth out of corporate. Conglomerates. Into the hands of regular people. And now Uber and Lyft is a platform where the average citizen can go and make a. Living and provide for. Their family. So instead of tens of thousands of jobs, you've got hundreds of thousands of people able to support their families. I'm one of those people. I struggled my whole life with a college degree to provide for my family. And I've just. Been doing it now for three years. And now I am able. To live here in the. City. I don't have any units here, but I'm able to live in a way that I never could before. So people forget that stars. Are a business. And are jobs. They support local entrepreneurs. We hire local companies. We hire cleaners and and dry cleaners and security people and CPAs. And so I think it's a disingenuous to say that stars are going to take jobs away. That's only from the hotel conglomerates. There are other jobs that are supported and other local small businesses. Dean Young. Your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. Thank you for allowing me to speak. My name is Jean Young. I'm a 30 year resident. Of Bixby North, now District five. I would recommend that the City Council accept the Coastal Commission recommendations. Lisa Wise Consulting and. Urban planning outfit. Who was involved in the four years of public input and outreach. They said that 1200. Represented less than 1%, I think it was 0.68%. Of housing stock. And as another. Speaker mentioned. Most of these units. Wouldn't be rented anyway. They'd stay vacant because. Owners want to. Have their family there. They may live in two cities, may use them part time. On hotel workers. We pay previous hotel workers very well, perhaps double the minimum wage. People should check out turn over B and B if you want to earn extra income. This is just the new sharing paradigm and. The way things are working now. So the ordinance again represents years of public input. It establishes standards. There are requirements. In place for. Our last speaker of the night, Jennifer Walton. Your 90 seconds begin now. Hi. Thanks for allowing me to speak. I would like to applaud the Coastal Commission's careful research and recommendations. I support these recommendations. I have a right to operate a business within my home. Flat out I have a business license. My staff is registered. I'm a conscientious host for nearly seven years now and a host of families from all over the world who would not come to Long Beach if stars were not offered. My rental is not a party house or a luxury tourist rental. I use my home throughout the year together as my own family. My ACR is not taking any homes off the market. If a hotel worker is looking for my work, they should reach out to the ACR owners and present their resumes. I pay $25 an hour. We're not taking work from anyone. My ACR is one of hundreds not located in the hotel areas downtown, so it doesn't take away any hotel bookings. My ACR brings families to Long Beach who may not be able to afford to come here. Otherwise, these families spend money on the local businesses and flood the city with new tax revenue. In addition, I pay the 30% transient occupancy tax and income tax. This revenue stream is vital for our great city. And other than that, I just want to say I love hosting. I bring business too, to the great city. I've been living here for about 30 years. I love it. I know the city well and I have repeat customers who come from all over the world. And I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's my. Own business. I am an entrepreneur and nobody will take this from us. We really appreciate all of your support and we work hard to bring wonderful people to our city, and we truly appreciate all the careful research that you have done. That concludes public comment. Okay. Thank you. And I appreciate all the public comment of take it back behind the wheel to the maker of emotion here as Councilmember Price. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you to the staff for your presentation and thank you to all of the speakers. I think the comments were extremely important on the concept that I think we can all agree with here. I don't think there's anybody on the city council who wants to increase the cap. So I want to talk a little bit about that with staff. I was going to make a motion to approve tonight, but with the following amendments. Sorry about that. My boys are home and my dogs are excited. The the the motion that I would like to make tonight and I know the staff touched upon it, but it didn't have enough specificity for me. But I would like city staff to come back and I'm going to ask a couple of questions, but I would like to direct city staff to come back to council when we have hit 700 registrations. To provide an update to Camp Salt and give us an opportunity to modify our existing cap as it relates to areas outside of the coastal zone. Just staff acknowledge that amendment. Is that clear. A county member. This is Oscar worthy. That is clear. Just wanted to let you know that in the previous decision, the council had asked us to come back and provide annual monitoring, but we can adjust that to include the 700th as a threshold. Yes, because I don't want to get anywhere near that 800, because if if and I understand staff has one interpretation and the folks that spoke tonight have a different interpretation. Let me just make it abundantly clear, I have no interest in going above the 800 cap. We work really hard as a council to get to that 800 cap. We don't want it to be increased. And so if the number of the cap is getting above 800, when we count the coastal zone apportionment, then I want to make sure that the Council has an opportunity to go back and amend. So I just have a couple of questions if you have clarity on that. The question I have right now is how many? How many? First of all, let's talk about enforcement. To me, the number one issue is enforcement. I was just looking at some of the articles because L.A. was referenced. And while I understand the L.A. law was cited, it's very clear from all of the articles and the data that L.A. has been really saddled with a lot of illegal operations. A lot. That's been a problem, too, for many people. So I don't want us to be in that situation. And enforcement is key for me. And we've been waiting for this policy to pass so that we can have enforcement mechanisms in place to be able to ensure quality of life for residents. So can we talk a little bit about that? Absent a policy, what are what is our ability to enforce? I'm sorry. Go ahead. Councilmember Price. We are doing enforcement outside the coastal zone today. So we do that through our traditional tools with code enforcement, but with short term rentals because of the ordinance. We also have a vendor host compliance that allows us to identify problem rentals or unregistered rentals. And if they don't come into compliance, they are removed from the hosting platform such as the RPO and Airbnb, the highly effective tool. But unfortunately we don't have that tool in that coastal zone until this council acts. So our intention is to start taking registrations tomorrow. If the council acts this evening, and that would allow us over a six month period to ramp up the enforcement and to be able to hold operators accountable within the coastal zone the same way that we're currently holding them accountable outside the coastal zone. Okay. I appreciate that, because I would venture to guess that many of the short term rentals that are desired are in the coastal zone. Does that does the data support that? Yeah. So that relates to this whole discussion about the cap outside the coastal zone. You know, we've been taking registrations for quite a while and we only have 200 on hosted outside the coastal zone. So there is more than sufficient capacity to meet the 350 that's required in the coastal zone and to preserve the 800 cap. In fact, based on current economic conditions and current uptake, we're going to end up below the 800 cap. We're not going to be exceeding that. I understand that the language is opaque, but what's very clear to me is you the council doesn't want to exceed that 800 cap. And by managing how we take applications and we'll be able to share that and we'll report back to council. Okay. So right now we have this is this registration process city wide absent the coastal zone has been open for a while now and we have only 200 registered staffers, is that correct? We have 200 open hosted, which is what's capped. There are some others that are hosted, but that's where the the person lives on site. So that's a different category. But as to the ones that count towards the cap, we only have 200, meaning we have a capacity of 600 and we only need to accommodate 350 in the coastal zone. Okay. So if we got 350 UNHOSTED permits in the next six months, let's say, plus the 200 that we currently have, we would have 550. That's correct. Councilwoman, your time has expired. Okay. Thank you. I make you back up, although my colleagues may have some questions I'm going to support with that amendment. So think I'm making the motion with that amendment. Are the second on the most. I don't know if it's Second Amendment, but we have a Councilmember Urunga, and then we have Councilmember Sara chewed up. And then please step in this way. Thank you. Senior member El Fosters for conducting this meeting this evening. You know, when this first came to my attention, it was one of those concerns about the commission basically overstepping its authority by requiring the city to accept more. That's true. The bottom line is that I think it's the language that is causing this confusion of the staff report from the commission, because we worked hard as a council to get to this 800 cap. We were we debate it. We. We, we. Pushed back and forth in terms of what was a number that we could come up to that would be acceptable to us and to see. So when this commission and I sit at the coast commission so that is my my head at this is double I hit it twice is that I really felt that the commission staff basically added something in there in their requirements that were far above and beyond what we as a city council voted for. So I was basically ready and I'm still debating this as to whether we should just go ahead and and drop it, send it back to the commission, make the corrections, and then bring it back to the city. So the question would be, I guess, to staff at this point is that if we were to. So did not approve this motion tonight. Giving back to staff to get it back to the commission. And basically start over from square one. How long what would be the timeline or timeframe on doing that? A council member. You're on it. If the council doesn't act on the language that came from the commission and doesn't act on that by the second week of June, our ordinance will be basically null and void in the coastal zone. So we would have to prepare a new ordinance, obtain passage at city council, submit it to the Commission, to the Coastal Commission to go through their staff review, have it scheduled for a hearing at the Coastal Commission, hopefully obtain some consensus there. Then come back to City Council for it to be certified. So that process typically takes 18 months. I can not predict how long it would take in this circumstance. I would only share with the Council that even if we were to go down that road, there may be advantages to adopting what's in front of you tonight and asking staff to request revisions to an adopted policy rather than just throwing out what's in front of you. Because until we have something adopted, we're not able to enforce the rules within the coastal zone. Which leads us to my second point is that if we were to say we are not adopt this motion to make. And we're looking at another maybe knowing that the commission is understaffed right now. So they it'll probably be pushed back even further to two years before this came back to us. What's. Do we have anything in mind here in regards to the. Enforcement of stories. Is there anything in place that we can use in writing a book? Councilman. We still have nuisance tools, so we would be able to individually go after, I guess, the worst of the worst. Not because of there being short term rentals, but because of violations of other, uh, law. But in terms of the enforcement tools that are most effective, being able to remove the listing from the platform, being able to revoke their operating license, we would not have that tool available to us if if we were in the limbo period of not having the adopted certified ordinance. Okay. So. At the end of the day with this motion that we had here is that we basically have a problem with the wording that the commission has given us or that is willing to adopt in the sense that it sounds like with the 800 cap that we have and the cap that we have with that city wide and then the 350 that we have in the coastal zone, the danger is that we may overstep that 800, 800. So as to our cap, we have 1135. Would that would that be something that we were afraid of? I, I, I hear that that they expressed concern of, of many of the speakers. I also hear that it's very important to the Council to maintain that 800 caps. So from the staff standpoint, we administer the program. We have total control of the program outside the coastal zone. We would not exceed the 800 cap because we would manage the licensing of, uh, aspires outside the coastal zone to preserve that cap. So there is no danger based on the numbers of that occurring. But I understand that theoretical concern that if there was a rush of a lot of, uh, short term rentals outside the coastal zone , that it could create that situation. So I think that, that, you know, if we had an adopted ordinance, we could over time work on refining that language. But in order to do. The enforcement that really is necessary today in the coastal zone. And we really need to have something on the books to be working from. And Councilmember Brown got it's very clear from this council when we initially started this process, we had that we had recommended 70 up to over 1700 units CAP and the council discussed it, discussed the balance between housing and hospitality opportunities, and narrowed down that number to 800. And so we're very mindful of that. And as Christopher said, we administer the program and we are also required to come back to you, providing you with updates on that. So staff is very clear on the intent of the council and the language that the Coastal Commission also provided to us. Councilman, your time is up. Okay, I'll real. Thanks. Next up is council member. Thank you. Council member. Austin Acting Mayor. So I just wanted to clarify Councilmember Price's amendment. So I just wanted to clarify if you are voting to propose to move forward. But with the amendment that the threshold be it is that the amendment you're you're requesting so that we do have an enforcement of an ordinance in place, but that we keep it to somehow a cap at 700 or a threshold. Exactly. That that staff comes back to us, that 700, so that we know how close we are to the cap and then we can initiate a new policy change that might need to go back to Coastal at that point if we're getting that close. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. I think as I do, I want to thank, you know, staffer as well as all the speakers for sharing their concern around this. And I just want to reiterate with what has been shared that while I wasn't here with the how hard fought raising and keeping the cap at 800, I do agree with the decision that was made to keeping it that and I do believe that we do need to have some kind of enforcement mechanism which will allow staff to be able to regulate STR. And I do think that making sure we come back, if we hit that 700 threshold so we can work on the existing language to make sure that we don't go over the 800 cap, which has been, I think for me, a really big concern. So so I supported it with moving it forward with that amendment that we do get a report back at 700 so that we can amend the language even though I didn't second, I don't know if that means that because I didn't hear. Council Member You're wrong a second. It's I don't know if I'm able to vote on the amendment, so if you can clarify that. For Porter. Clarification for me, I was going to second, but I wanted to discuss it first. And I think that your amendment for 700 come back. I think it's a good one. And I checked that. So you do. Second, it would be clear. Yes. What I have for the comments that I have queued. Up next, we have both of councilmembers in Dallas. Thank you very much, Councilmember Armstead. I know this is that. This is. Crazy topic because we've worked so hard to get the 800 max. And I think it's very important that we have very, very clear language going forward, that that's where we want to remain. And, you know, so thank you just for clarifying all that. I think it's very important that we do remain that and that we do have that clarifying language in there. So one of the things that I just want to make sure for for everyone is that. What we're talking about is making sure that our cap remain at 800, including the 350 short term rentals that the Coastal Commission is requesting or recommending in that area. I'm you know, I like the fact that we are low in short term rentals right now, that we have plenty of room to include. So. Just one more time staff is that is that would I'm it is what I'm understanding. Correct. Yes, Councilmember, that is correct. Thank you. I just want to make sure that, you know, and maybe maybe what we do is make sure that that language is anything that we vote on tonight to make sure that it's very, very clear. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Next up, we have Councilmember Price again. Thank you. Councilman Austin, I just wanted to clarify a few things. So if staff comes back to us when we hit 700 and we're going to hit 700, if we assume that we get 350 in the coastal zone, that we have the 200 outside of the coastal zone that we currently have, plus an additional number to get us to 700. Assuming we get to that, 700 and staff comes back to us. Can council then vote to reduce the number of staffers outside of the coastal zone? Councilmember. Go ahead, Christopher. Yeah. So a councilmember at this council always retains the ability to change these regulations outside the coastal zone. So we certainly will come back at 700. I think we'll probably come back before then because we're also doing annual report backs. And I hear everyone's comments that the language is imperfect. It's much easier to refine the language with the Coastal Commission once we have something approved and in place, then then the from scratch process. So what will happen is, you know, depending on time and resources, some action is taken tonight. We would come back at the soonest point that different things happen. So in the unlikely event that we had 700 quickly where we'd be back in front of you in the more likely event we would be back in a year to provide you an update. And we would also have exchange notes with the Coastal Commission staff and perhaps be in front of you with language changes and make things more clear as we implement the program over time. And we could also make any adjustments outside the coastal zone that the council wanted to make. Okay. So just just for clarity, council can make a change. If we were to hit 700 real quickly and you brought it back to us, we could make a change. That change could include one. We change the cap for areas that are outside of the coastal zone to lower it. But we could also go back to coastal with language change or modification requests. It's just we can't do that if we don't have a policy in place. Right. That is that is correct. So if an action is taken tonight, starting tomorrow, you know, we can always make changes to this ordinance. But the starting point is being able to take some action this evening. Okay. So if I could just share with my colleagues why it's important to have something in place, step back. Since we adopted this has not been able to do really anything in the coastal zone. So if there are party houses, if there are we had a shooting at one store. If there are quality of life issues, there's very little that staff can do right now that's in that's consistent with what we all agreed would be reasonable limitations to put on stars, to get them off of the pro of the online profile. So we can't do that right now. Also, neighborhood opt out provisions not even available right now in the coastal zone. So a lot of what's available in the ordinance is not even available right now to the coastal zone and most of the stars in the city, probably over 80% of them are going to be in the coastal zone. So we just need to have some policy in place because it's a little bit of a wild west in the coastal zone right now with stars. So I'd ask staff to I'd ask my council colleagues to trust that staff will bring this back to us when we get close to that cap. And then we can reroute as a council and lower the cap or go back to council or even go back. I mean, coastal, we can even go back to Coastal before then to ask for the language change. As Council Councilman Ranga mentioned, once we adopt the policy, we can go back and ask them to amend the language to make it more clear in terms of what our intentions are. I believe that's what I heard staff say. So with that. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I'll just reiterate, I think the council reserves the right to change policy on any given Tuesday. Council member Urunga. And then we have Council member Alan. I think the customer analysis. I totally agree with the. Analysis that comes with a price brought forward. And that is exactly what I was going to say. What I when I ran out of time is the fact that this whole issue is brought before us here today, at least because Coastal Commission staff wrote a report that was. More confusing that we wanted to have. It does somewhat imply that our 800 s to our cap would be exceeded, and that is not what we would like to see. That's where I would like to see. Just to give you a brief history, I mean, Coastal Commission appointed. Appointed Commission doesn't always agree with staff reports that affect the commission staff. Sometimes they don't get it right and they don't get it exactly right, as the commission would like to see. So we've had in the past opportunities to connect with Commission staff, let them know that we disagree with their staff report and go back and do it again, or renegotiate or do whatever they need to do to ensure that whatever the commission passes is in line with what the commission wants. And that's where I'm at right now, is the fact that I would push that we would go ahead and and adopt this motion tonight with the caveat that staff is going to go back to the commission and have this language corrected or have it clarified that the 800 cap on this 2 hours will not be exceeded. I also accepted the the amendment that Councilmember Sato put forward that once we reach 700, if we start looking at. Amending our emotions in the city so that we can make sure that Iraq will be no no exceeding of the 800 cap or maybe even not exceeding the 50 that we are considering along the coastal zone where we're in good and safe ground right now. We're not even near close to reaching the 800, but of course, that could change. And as a city council, we have the right to amend our our our ordinances and our emotions. And that's where I'm at. So we have to make sure that the language is there, very clear that we are not going to be exceeding our 800 cap citywide and we're not going to be exceeding our cap on the coastal zone. So. I'm good to go now. Thank you. Thank you. So most of the made is seconded. We have council member Cindy Allen. Awesome. Thank you. I guess you call your acting acting mayor often. You're doing a great job. So I also want to say thank you to the staff for their hard work on this. And I know there was a lot of work from previous council before my time to get where you guys are at today. So I just want to recognize that. And also I did appreciate a council member your range really giving us, you know, his insight from the Coastal Commission perspective and also for his service on the commission. I think it really helps as we make these decisions. I think that regulating short term rentals throughout the city, including the coastal zone, you know, is important. And so we heard that tonight. I definitely want to make sure that we protect the character of our neighborhood. And also, of course, you know, the jobs at our hotels. I absolutely support, you know, limiting the number of hours on the coastal zone to 350. And I also like Councilwoman Soothing Price's recommendation for, you know, checking at 700. Absolutely. In favor of keeping that cap at 800. There's no need for us to oversaturate our coastal zone or or anywhere else. And then, like my other colleagues have said, you know, monitoring, tracking, tracking those regulations and help us determine the impact of those policies are, are and important. So again, I want to thank the staff for their hard work with them for all of their hard work with the Coastal Commission. Thank you. That's all I have. Thank you. I'll just add a few comments at this point. I want to just say I think this has been a very productive discussion. I think public comment was, you know, obviously we learned a lot from our public on both sides of this issue. I want to clarify that the motion is on the table is to approve with an amendment made by Councilmember Price to have a staff come back to the council. Once we reach 700, start usage kind of trigger to ensure that we don't go over the cap that. Which emotion was. That? That was my emotion. Thank you. Okay. Now, emotion was seconded by council member Urunga. I do think it's important for us to move something this evening because that enforcement in the coastal zone is, I think, extremely important. That's where the demand for stars are in our city. But I think we do need to be mindful of public comments on the importance of preserving our housing stock. I know the Council have been very committed just to our work over the last several years to enhance and increase our housing stock. And yes, we still have a long way to go in terms of building new housing in the city and in protecting housing stock. And so I think that's that's a that's a core here. And I think our cap, after many years of negotiations and haggling with all of the parties, the platforms we have, I think, settled on an account that makes sense for our city and a policy that makes sense for our city. And I think, again, I'll mention that we reserve the right, you know, three weeks from now, three months from now or a year from now, to come back and modify this policy to make it even better. That's that's part of policy making, improving upon what we we're we're doing here each and every Tuesday night. So with that, Madam Clerk, we've heard from the council, please, of roll call vote. District one. I'm district two. By. District three by district for. My. District five. High District six. I District seven. I. District eight. I. Motion is carried eight zero. It's scripted. So now I think we have to go to a general public comment. Clear.","Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by amending and restating Chapter 5.77, related to short-term rentals, read and adopted as read.

Rehabilitation appears one, two and three at Alameda Point. Do you. And then we have. So member de sog understand you pulled up pulled this. I pulled it. I remember already. Did you want to start then. I just wanted to hear the presentation and then I'll make a brief comment after the presentation. I'm. Good evening. Good evening, mayor and City Council members. I'm Nanette Mchunu and the Community Development Department. Also in Bay three is. So this study, let me tell you a little bit about peers one, two and three. In 2008, the city that our governing body initiated a study, a condition assessment report of peers one, two and three at Alameda Point. And at that time, the peer well, let me just say the peers were constructed in the 1940s. Peer one peers two and three are large, reinforced concrete structures originally designed for aircraft carriers. Pier One is a smaller steel and concrete cellular structure. And at that time, the majority of Pier One was in general good condition. It was built in 19, rebuilt in 1980. Pier two, which is what I call the workhorse of our piers, because it's used on both sides for most for the myriad ships. And it is heavily used. And this kind of. Can you show us with your pointer location? Sure. Let's see if this pointer works. We would dim the lights, but then a councilmember couldn't see. Yeah. Oh. So I think this is a clicker, not a pointer. There's. All right. I might need some technical assistance from the city clerk. Yes. This one? Yeah, I. We're not working now. Oh, sorry. We need to turn it on that now. How many city employees? Okay. All right, so I'm here, it appears. This is Pier One, the shorter one. This is Pier two with all the ships on it. So it's the workhorse. And this is pure three where Hornet also is located. Just for your reference. Thank you. You're welcome. So Pier three is actually in the best condition of all the piers. And it's sort of unfortunate because it's there and it doesn't necessarily take advantage of all of the services there. It could be since it's just a museum and it's not a working vessel. It it could you know, it's unfortunate that the ships these other ships are not being able to take advantage of it. So I'm the 2008 study gave us this assessment that the peers were in fair to poor or fairly good condition, depending on which peer we were talking about. And during that whole time we had been since then, we'd been really wanting to go deeper and figure out what we need to do to breathe new life in these pillars. We have a tenant and I'm here, the mirrored chips, which has about 15 more years left on these piers. And they are not doing so well because remember, this study said they were in good to fair condition in 2008, which was eight years ago. So the study that we're proposing to do tonight or we're asking your permission to find tonight is a let me back up a little bit that the 2008 report was a study that asked for more studies. And I'm I'm quite frankly, I'm kind of over those kinds of studies. And we really need a study that tells us what we need to do next. And as a city, we can't afford to wait to have 10,000 more studies to do. So the study that we're proposing tonight is the first in three phases. And so the first phase is to get in, get under the water, look at the piles, do some sampling. Tell us what the heck is going on down there, because we know that the piles underneath the piers are are damaged and there's some organic materials that are destroying them, which is not unusual for peat piles that age. And also, we want to know the next step. What do we do to repair them short of tearing them all out and rebuilding, which we don't have the money to do? What can we do to breathe new life into these piers for the next 15 years for myriad or longer? So the report that. But a group that we selected as BGH has a. Yes. Thank you. The city clerk is going to show you some pictures of our lovely piers from underneath the wharf. And Miss McNaught, she's pulling us up. Could you just remind us what Murat is and the importance of. Sure. Sure. The mirrored ships are the ready reserve fleet. They are in the Department of Transportation. They are not Navy ships. They are ships that were decommissioned and they inherited from the Navy. And they are deployed when there are natural disasters or a need for our country to respond. They were in Haiti during the earthquake. If there were if there were a huge earthquake and when there will be a huge earthquake in this region, the mirrored ships will play an important role. I attended a meeting with FEMA representatives talking about what's going to happen in the region. And the myriad ships were were. Key. To what's what will happen. And the fact that those ships are in Alameda really guarantees that goods and services will come to Alameda. So they're very critical to our city. Also locally, they ships alone represent roughly 6%, I think is the number of 6% of the energy consumed of all of Alameda, those ships alone. And also and I think and you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you may know this, I think when California was having a lot of rolling blackouts, the ships were able to convert to their own power source to save the draw within our city. So they were able to they're able to be a large consumer that helps our city. And they also are able to support themselves, which also helps the city. Exactly. That's the punch line is they're a major revenue source for our Alameda Municipal. They're one of our largest tenants. Allow me to point the other important thing, which is kind of an intangible, is that they support a lot of the maritime industry in the Bay Area. A lot of the small welders or people who can can make things that you can't make find for these ships anymore are employed by Myriad to help keep those ships running. So they they are a feeder of other other businesses. Thank you. And could they also be used if there were a time when we needed to evacuate a large number of citizens? I would imagine that that would be a significant that would be a role they could play. I don't know if they would play it because they really are about staging. They're able to put together a hospital in a matter of two days. And so I think that if we were needing to deploy people, I think between them and the wider facility, that would be a way of getting people on and off that island. Thank you. I think the pictures are up. Okay. So I think we're just going to go. I mean, I don't there's nothing to really tell. It's just a visual about the pork. Maybe tell us what we're looking at. Okay. So these are some of the piles that are underneath there, underneath our our piers. You can see the concrete is not in the best condition and you can keep going. And then some of them, you can see that the corrosive material on the outside, you'll see below the water. A lot of them are just eaten away. And so they're not even connected to the ground anymore because of the the corrosive material. This is the concrete on the work. This is the material that kind of gets on there and the concrete on the wharf and the vaults they're cracking. And, you know, I think I remember council member matter. I see if I see your mattress, you won't say anything over the water just gets beaten. And and that's kind of what we're seeing here is that this concrete is completely compromised. You see a diver down there looking at like the this the deterioration of the concrete on the piles. Am so sorry stage is proposing to work 250 days on I on I study the first 100 there were going to be in the water testing getting samples you see the little have a corrosion has below the water really compromise the the piles. We'll be testing. And then they take the the test results and they compile an engineering analysis. And remember, we're not going to have a report that asks for other reports. And from that analysis, they are going to identify the deficiencies in our facility. At the end of the day, the city is going to get a product with recommendations for repair, a variety of repair schemes. So they're not going to just force us into one kind of solution. They're going to say, if you want five more years, this is what we do. If you if you need 20 more years out of this, this is what you should do. And so we can work together. It will be a process of developing a plan for those, Piers. And in addition, there will be cost estimates. We will have they will provide us with what they think it'll cost to do some of these repairs. Of course, we will bid it out and see what the market says, but we'll have some idea of what we're getting into. And we'd have to we'll have to find the money. But most importantly, as we put together this plan, they're going we're going to put together a priority list of what we really need to take care of and and move move forward to try to, number one, keep the mirrored ships here and support them and to provide them with a facility that meets their needs through the life of their contract and even beyond. If if we can negotiate that. Or and also to breathe new life into our peers that have not really had a lot of TLC since the eighties. So that's the that's the goal of this. You have any questions? Just one question. Can you kind of describe because I'm not sure if everyone understands how the sewage is processed on a pier currently. So Pier two had a major sewer line break. And the problem, as you can see, this picture kind of tells you the problem with a lot of the infrastructure on the piers is it's under the piers. And so there are not a lot of contractors who want to work under the piers. And so either we end up getting gouged because we can only find one person who can do the work or we have to piece it together and figure out what we're going to do long term. And so we actually bid this right now, the the the ships are they're equipped to be on sea. So they their sewage is in their tanks. And we are paying to have those tanks pumped out and the waste trucked out. I'm happy to report that the council approved a sewer replacement project which will bring the sewer sewer line above the pier, but it costs $1.4 million and the project will be completed next month. So we'll stop doing that. But that's the that's what's going on here, too, right now. Then just quick comments. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I pulled this because, I mean, to me, this is kind of like my little pet issue is everyone. When they take me around town, they want to show me their deteriorating Piers. So I I'm all in favor of this. I'm not going to vote against that. I didn't pull it for that. But I think it's important for people to see these pictures because they don't get an opportunity to see them like we do either in like a consent calendar or when we're going on tour. So if you go around town, it's not only Pier two, you go to Alameda Marina. You know, some of the wooden ones are like stalactites and stalagmites where, you know, they're not even touching each other anymore. They're so rotted out. The Grand Marina, you know, the owners there showed me their peers and wharfs are deteriorating. Alameda landing. So it's just to kind of draw attention to this issue and keep it on our radar that, you know, this is kind of a priority of mine to make sure we find a way to replace this crumbling infrastructure. So I appreciate your presentation and the pictures. Thank you. And that being said, could you explain the funding source? I'm sure this this project is being funded out of the Tidelands Fund. So it is these these piers are on the Tidelands. And so all the revenue that's collected from the Tidelands property has to be reinvested in Tidelands property. So this is a perfect use for those funds. Thank you very much. Any other questions or comments? Council members? We have a motion. You pull that, you make it. I'll move approval of the item. I'll second all those in favor. A motion carried unanimously. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Now we move to six a. Adoption of resolution appointing a member of the Civil Service Board.

An ordinance relating to affordable housing on properties owned or controlled by religious organizations. Modifying existing development standards to. Facilitate creation of affordable housing. The committee recommends the bill. Passed as amended. Thank you so much. Once again, this comes out of Councilmember Strauss's committee, so I'm going to hand it back over to him about walk us through this item. Thank you, counsel. President, colleagues, this legislation, as stated, would grant zoning flexibility to affordable housing developments on land owned or controlled by religious organizations. The this is a long awaited bill. It first was passed by a state legislature, and we are now taking it up here within the city to make it a law within our city. And so there are many projects that are already underway, assuming that the language contained in the state bill would be passed at a city level. These are long awaited changes that stem from what was already adopted at the legislature. In most cases, affordable housing on eligible sites would be given one additional story of height in single family zones. Additional capacity would be granted without raising maximum heights. And in some of the denser multi-family and mid-rise zones, additional stories beyond the one floor would be granted. In order to qualify for this flexibility, sites would need to be owned or controlled by a religious institution, and the housing would be required to be affordable to households making up to 80% of the area median income. We do expect that for the majority, most of these projects using this flexibility will be providing affordable homes to incomes below 60% area median income due to the Office of Housing Requirements for funding. So if a if a site uses Office of Housing Dollars, they already have to meet the 60% area median income threshold, providing housing to people at 60%, median income or below. The difference between the 60 and 80% is flexibility that the legislature wanted to provide for institutions to use private dollars rather than city funded city funds to create this affordable housing. This is flexibility I have heard is desired. We heard from the Greater Church, the Church Council of Greater Seattle, that they would appreciate this flexibility, at least initially, so that we can see if this flexibility is going to be used as intended or if not. And that's part of why I really appreciated Councilmember Peterson's amendment to the bill. The Office of Housing, the Land Use Committee, chose to leave the requirement that 80% area median income because we have heard, as I said, there is interest from churches to see if this middle income, affordable housing development could be possible without city subsidy. Additionally, we have heard from the Church Council of Greater Seattle. They were again opposed to the lowering of the 80% threshold out of concern it would exclude churches who are navigating an already difficult process of financing and permitting affordable housing. I'm excited. I am excited to see this legislation passed today to open up more possibilities for much needed affordable housing across the city. I expect to see an immediate impact as there are projects awaiting this bill to pass today before we can begin development processes. And as we confront a homeless and housing crisis, more creative solutions like this are necessary to ensure we are doing all we can to meet these challenges at the scale of the crisis. Colleagues, I'm happy to take additional questions. That is the committee report at this time. Thanks so much, Councilmember Strauss. We do have a couple of amendments discussed this morning during council briefing, so we're going to go ahead and consider the proposed amendments. That's Amendment one. An amendment to both comes from Councilmember Herbold that we will have debate on each of those amendments and then we will take a vote on the respective amendments. And then I will open up the floor for discussion and conversation on on the bill as amended or not amended. So so if you are hoping to comment on the bill as a whole before final passage, you will have an opportunity to do so. Right now, what we're going to do is focus our energy on the two proposed amendments that Councilmember Herbold discussed during this morning's council briefing with a slight modification to Amendment one, as I understand it. So I'm going to go in and hand it over to Councilmember Herbold to make her motion on Amendment One. Thank you so much. I move to amend Council Bill 12 0081 as presented on the recently distributed Amendment one be. Second. It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment one. I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Herbold to walk us and the viewing public through Amendment One as proposed. Thank you. So Amendment one d would lower the average affordable housing income eligibility threshold to 60% of AMI average median income for renter households after an initial period at 80% average median income. State law requires a minimum 80% AMI affordability and allows cities lower affordability requirements, just like we do with MFT. The multifamily tax exemption program. That too sets a minimum affordability requirement and we have, as the policy body, have deepened those affordability requirements under the MFT program, most recently under the leadership of Councilmember Mosqueda. In response to the concerns that I heard from Council members just this morning, I have altered the amendment to change the effective date of the average 60% AMI until not be effective until July 1st, 2022, so that any projects that are currently in the pipeline that have been operating under the state's law will have the certainty that they need. 80% AMI Rent for a studio is $1,620 for a one bedroom. It's $1,851. We do not need to incentivize private developers to build units at these rents. It's practically market rate rent already. If we do that, if we if we create an incentive for churches to work with private developers to build these basically rather expensive, affordable housing units, there will be fewer mission based nonprofit developers partnering with these same religious institutions and less rentals at affordable, lower affordability rates. Though I really hope this sort of compromise version of this amendment can be supported by the Council today. Thank you. Thank you so much, Councilmember Strauss. You have your hand up. Thank you. Council President. Councilmember Herbold, as discussed at this morning's meeting. I will not be supporting this amendment today. I hear your. And I thank you for making that change. I did give you a call. You didn't? I didn't. We weren't able to connect by phone. So I think some of this could have been worked out on the phone. At this time, it is important for me to see if this program actually exists and if this flexibility is actually used. Because as we know and as I was stated just a minute ago, the majority, if not almost all of these projects that will be using this flexibility will receive city funds that meet that require meeting the needs that you just described of 60% AMI or below. It is important to me that we provide it when the Church Council of Greater Seattle, who are the majority stakeholders who would be utilizing this flexibility, have called in and just testified that they would not support this this amendment. It is important to me that we reflect that we respect that request, which is why I think that it would be important for us to take this up in a year when we have the data that Councilmember Peterson has requested in our hands to review the effectiveness of this of this plan. I share your concerns of wanting to have more affordable housing at lower rates. And that's why I would still be open to this conversation, because I know of the number of projects that are waiting for this bill to pass. I do not want to delay this today. Thank you, Councilmember, for. Are there any additional comments where. Peterson, please. Thank you, council president, and thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for bringing these amendments forward today. Is the the city council's central staff memo, when this bill was put forward, laid out issue ID and mentioned this as one of the issues to potentially lower the affordability threshold, which the state the bipartisan state bill representing the entire state put it at 80%. And I think that I, I support Councilmember remarks where we're trying to lower, you know, make it for very low income residents. I appreciate that it has the averaging so that you can bring in folks who are experiencing homelessness at 30% or lower and try to average it out with higher AMI. But still the average being at 60%. And appreciate that you put in that one year grace period. So I'll be supporting this amendment. Thank you for bringing it forward. Thank you, Councilman Pearson. Councilmember Morales. Thank you. I. I will. I'm a little conflicted here. I totally agree that we do need to be providing more options for housing that is affordable at lower rates at 60%. And I am concerned that this amendment would hinder or hinder religious organizations that can build affordable housing without public finance, as as there's been indications, some current and some are interested in. So at this time, I don't think I can support an amendment that would impede the synagogues and churches in my district from developing affordable housing for their seniors. And I know that there are some projects that are hoping to get started just that way. So at this time, I was. Supporting this amendment. Thank you. Customer Morales. I have a quick question. So, Councilmember Herbold there, there. It's clear that the council wants to create more deeply affordable housing. I think we're all aligned in that desire and that intent. And and and I think that Amendment one B is designed to hopefully create that incentive. And what I'm hearing from. The organizations that would be impacted by this legislation, that they are concerned that the law that in practice the intent or the sort of the theory that we're presenting in Amendment One be and may not be able to be executed in practice. And I guess I'm wondering whether you and your office have done any analysis on that particular concern that has been expressed by by religious institutions who have an interest in participating in the program as as structured. This amendment is intended to disincentivize religious institutions partnering with anybody other than mission based, nonprofit, affordable housing providers. If if it's at 60%, they're going to partner. If it's at 80. There's no there's no reason for a a religious institution to partner with the nonprofit, because the nonprofits are already going to be doing the 60% there. They are then going to look at a partnership that will result in a higher yield, a higher return to the religious institution. I'm just very concerned that we're talking about the position of the of the the owners of the property, as if that is the thing that should be driving our policymaking. Our policymaking is really about creating identifying the affordable housing that that we need to build in our city. Listening to people who would operate under those regulations and delivering policy that reflects the needs of our city. I am not surprised that an advocacy organization who is representing in this case is as fine as I am of the advocacy of the Church Council. They are. They are they're advocating for the interest of the property owners in this in this case. And just like we hear from private property owners when we're debating MSHA or debating MFT. Property owners have a have a have an inclination to prefer more flexibility with with the potential for greater financial return . And I believe that our our decisions today should be based on the type of housing that we want to see developed using these these incentives. Because I don't I don't necessarily disagree with your analysis. My question is about the kind of housing stock we want to create and whether we are. Whether your amendment advances in practice. Not in theory, but if it will if if it will actually be achieved. I, i and I'll just sort of lay it out there. I don't want to support an amendment that is in theory, you know, values aligned and sending the right signals, but then in practice may not actually come to fruition. And that's that's that's that's what my question is about is about. Is about when you say that they're, you know, these religious organizations who are property owners who are interested in developing the property for affordable housing, if they that they will find someone who will construct at 60%. Am I I guess my question is, is how how do you know that? Because that has there been an analysis on that component? We have been told that the units that are at 60% army that are developed with this under this regulation would in effect, have city dollars in them because they would be built by nonprofits. We have heard from members of our nonprofit developer community. Sharon Lee has contacted, I think, many of us in support of this amendment. And I don't know if she was signing the letter that we all received from the Central Area Land Use Committee in her capacity as a neighbor or her capacity as an employee of roots housing. But Donna Moody signed the letter from the Central Area Land Use Committee in support of a similar amendment to the one that's before us right now. So. So, based on that letter, you believe that there are nonprofit housing developers who would be available and ready to participate with religious organizations to effectuate the intent of Amendment One be. I do. Okay. Okay. Councilmember Strauss, I see that you have your hand up. Thank you. Council President I think what I heard Councilmember Herbold say is that there's no incentive for. Property owners to use to get to 60% or am I? And I just need to call out the fact in my previous statements and I've said a couple of times today, the majority, if not almost all of these projects will most likely be using city funds requiring 60%. Ami the flexibility that we are looking at is to see if and to your point just now, do all of the nonprofit housing developers have the capacity to take on all of the projects that have now opened under this new legislation? And that's the question we just don't actually know the answer to. We also don't know how many of these institutions have the capacity to do that private fundraising, to utilize that 20% flexibility of AMI. These are questions not yet known, and I believe that we need to provide as much flexibility as possible and also not. I think we just need to allow as much flexibility as possible for the next year. I'm happy to come back to this in a year from now, analyze the data and make changes or come back smaller than that. I do think that at this time, you know, we made sure in my committee to have this I have to have this bill before us twice so that we met my desire to have the committee review an ordinance twice before passing or doing so as quickly as possible, because we know that there are churches waiting to utilize this policy as written from the state. Thank you. Okay. Kinsman. Harold, you'll get the last word. So I just want to scan the room and make sure no one else has any questions or comments on Amendment one. Be. Councilmember Peterson, please. Thank you. Council President Just a point of clarification for the people viewing this. The 80% am-I is still for the homeownership projects. This this amendment applies just to the the rental residential. So so there is flexibility already built in for homeownership projects where you tend to look for a higher AMI to be able to afford the mortgages so so that is there so those religious organizations that want to pursue homeownership projects will still have the 80%. And then this amendment applies just to the rental housing. Just wanted to clarify. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Councilor Peterson. Any other comments before I ask Council Councilmember Herbold to close out debate? Customer, was it? I've seen you come off camera a couple of times. Would you like to add anything? I'll give you a minute to settle in. Thank you. Council President. I'm seeking cooler rooms in our home here, so apologies for the change in location. Okay. I appreciate the opportunity to again weigh in on this. I do want to make sure that I clarify for the record. There is. Not currently a policy that I think. We could put. Into place to. Deter nonprofit developers. From developing affordable housing. More than 1600, for example. The fact that. Rental units are so high is in part because we do not have enough. Rental units. It's not a matter of whether or not there's developers who are seeking certain price points. It's that we don't have enough rental units. And so if we want to address the cost of those rental. Units, I think one of the best things that we can do through this. Legislation is is increase the amount of rental units in Seattle across the market, especially up to 80% and live all of the lack of housing as pointed out by the McKinstry study that came out now twice in the last two years as constantly show that we don't have enough housing, including at 80% AMI or affordable housing units . And all of that puts downward pressure on affordable units across the across the market. I, again, will be not supporting this amendment because. I do think that it is a. Counter to the shared goals, which is making sure that there's more affordable. Housing units out there. Overall period, and that we're doing everything that we can working. With these. Current. Property owners who. Are part of religious. Institutions, who have said, help us develop. This parking lot or this empty space into affordable housing. I think if we can. Work as fast as possible to build those affordable units up to 80% of AMI, it will actually help those who are 60% below estimate since. The report. Came to. The conclusion. So I apologize for not having that typed out to be. Able to more eloquently. Make the point as I've been shuffling through very. Warm rooms, but hope. That the point. Gets across that if we can encourage as many housing developers to build affordable units, including at 80% and below, then it does. Absolutely. The data shows that it does support affordable units opening up for folks who are at the lowest income levels as well. And I appreciate the leadership of Councilmember Strauss on the bill as underlined. That came out of committee and report supporting that today. A good customer. Mosqueda and I now have councilmembers still want in the cuz. I'm going to give her an opportunity to make some comments here before we close out debate council for a smart place. Thank you. First of all, I just wanted to second the points that Councilmember Herbold made in explaining why this amendment makes sense, because I think that all of the points you made are absolutely based, in fact, and like her, I also have a lot of respect for the judge council. You know, we are my office has worked with the church council and with many other faith leaders, and we will continue to do so, including the project that I mentioned this morning in briefing the. My office is going to be advocating for and hoping that. And I'm hoping that the rest of the council will support for affordable housing projects, especially in the Central District, but also on Capitol Hill and Othello and District two and so on. And we we need to continue that united work. But I think that in this case, it is a little bit akin to the debate that the then council had on the question of mandatory housing affordability. And it is a similar situation here where with or without this amendment, what we're talking about are changes on the margin, really. And that is what energy also and ultimately that work that, as I've said before, the main objective that the Chamber of Commerce and the landlord lobby had with the MTA was not so much that they were gaining a whole lot. What they did gain, though, was completely drowning the incipient affordable housing debate at that time or into this question of. You know, the esoteric, affordable questions of the Amaechi related legislation, which they didn't really ultimately talk about actual affordability. And I think I am supporting this amendment. I am going to say a few things in addition to what dancing both said. But also I wanted to say that, you know, at the end of the day and this is my message to also my friends at the church council and others that ultimately, you know, obviously, even though we may not agree on this particular amendment, I think we have to going forward, really continue to work together to massively expand affordable housing because the crisis is so acute, the affordability crisis. But I do think it is unfortunate that politicians continue repeating these supply side arguments about how it's mainly the lack of the number of rental units that is causing the affordability crisis. This is not borne out by the data, although, yes, of course we need. Do we need more density? Absolutely. Do we need much more of a zoning change in the city to allow multiple housing units to like apartment buildings to be built? Absolutely. Do we need more housing to be built? Absolutely. All of that is true. And yet none of that makes it true that the lack of the number of rental units is the problem. This is a supply side argument. This is the argument that the real estate industry makes. This is what property management corporations say. And I will you will certainly not catch me making those arguments at the end of the day. The question is affordability and simply building more does not ensure affordability. As an economist, I'm speaking, you know, in terms of just having looked at the data and there is no economist in this world who can tell you that, okay, you build up to this political threshold and then housing will start becoming affordable because rents will start coming down. There is no evidence to show that that happens. There's simply no evidence. And as a matter of fact, you know, in the pre-pandemic period, Seattle was the construction crane capital of the world, three years running. So if you look at the data and if the council claims to be data driven, then none of these arguments are supported by the argument that that is the main reason for the lack of affordability is not support. Do we need more density and more expansion? Absolutely. And I also think, though, there are important arguments that are made by are being made by affordable housing providers of one is that when you look at 80% area median income, that is if you look at the actual numbers, you know, in terms of what the rent actually is, it happens to be market rate in some cases. And it's just it's just difficult to believe that it is not possible to build housing more affordably than that. And we know there are housing providers who can build to greater affordability if there are avenues for them to get those opportunities. And there are public funding options available for even 80% of area median income housing like 4% federal tax credits. And so I will be supporting this amendment because from everything I have seen, the housing can be made more affordable than 80%. And I think it should be just if you look at the runs, the qualified 80% Amma, they are like market rate units. I mean, it's quite stunning actually when you see the numbers out of council members do look at those numbers as well. And I will, as I said, support this amendment. And I continue and my office continues to look forward to working with the faith community on really pushing for affordable housing and continuing to make the city much more affordable than it is today. Thank you. Think your customers want more herbal before I pass it back to you to close that debate. In having this conversation, there's been a few comments about how lowering the Army from 80% to 60% army would require. A. Subsidy from the city. What I'm what is confusing to me about that statement is, is whether that means that if this amendment didn't pass, there wouldn't be a subsidy required. And and I'm not sure that that's the case. But but secondly, if it is the case that a subsidy would be required, do you think that your amendment has the impact of requiring a deeper subsidy from some city resources in order to effectuate the intent of more deeply affordable rental housing units? The amendment itself has no impact on whether a subsidy is required. The fact that nonprofit developers working with religious institutions to develop land on the property owned by religious institutions. It's just a statement of fact that those nonprofit developers are likely to be getting funds from the city, and as a requirement of those funds, they will very likely be maintaining units at 60%. So this issue is being brought up to say that this amendment, my amendment is unneeded because as Desmond Strauss has said, the majority of developers that will be working with religious institutions will be receiving a subsidy from the city and will be maintaining their rents at 60%. AMI So that that is a that is a statement that is used to say that my amendment is unneeded. I, I believe my amendment is needed. I do not want to create the conditions where for profit developers are in a position to basically bump out our nonprofit housing developers in a in a situation where a religious facility , a religious institution is choosing between which developer to work with if they choose to work with the developer who does not intend to take city dollars, does not intend to do mission based affordable housing development. The religious institution could then choose to work with the for profit developer at a greater financial return to the religious institution, which I understand that that is something that is desirable. But I'm just going to make these my closing comments, if that's okay, because answering your question, I think, is is is my closing comment. Sure. Go ahead. Reportedly, the the density bonus about doubles the land value. So religious institutions need to be, I think, in exchange giving a public benefit in exchange, as has been said before. 80%, AMI rents are basically market rate rents. And I would just to say those numbers, again, in case people didn't catch them when I saw them the first time, that's $1,620 for a studio and that is $1,851 for a one bedroom apartment. That's 80%, Amy. That is basically market. If you do accept the argument, as Councilmember Saunders does not agree with the argument, but if you do accept the argument that building more supply of housing will drive the market down, well, then you're going to have a subsidy, a an incentive program where the rents are actually higher than market. And that just again, there's there's no there's no public value in that. All right. Thank you so much, council member Herbold, for both answering my question and wrapping up debate on this one. I appreciate it. I think we have exhausted our conversation and debate on Amendment one B. So I am going to go ahead and call this one up for a vote now. So will the clerk please call the roll on the adoption of Amendment one? The. Let's get a. Not so much. Sorry I got locked out. Yes, I am. I know. That's. That's Number Peterson. Yes. Swan. Yes. Strauss now. Revolt. Yes. Yes. Thank you, Councilmember Lewis. Yes. Councilmember Morales. Oh. Council member or Council President Gonzalez, I. And Councilor Muscat. That was it. Yes. Is that correct? No. It wasn't. Thank you. Just wanted to double check. Five in favor, three opposed. All right. The motion carries, the amendment is adopted and the amended bill is before the council. We do have another amendment, and that's amendment to some. And I hand it over to Council member Herbold to walk us through Amendment two. Thank you again. Skip over to my notes here. So I move to amend council bill 12 0081 is presented on the recently distributed amendment to. Second. It's been moved and seconded to amend the bill as presented on Amendment two. I'm going to hand it back over to Councilmember Herbold to address her amendment. Thank you. So this is pretty straightforward. This amendment would simply increase the term of affordability to 75 years from 50 years. I really want to, in offering this amendment, uplift the leadership of former Councilmember Rob Johnson. I think he really, with the MFA program, did the city a great service in moving our affordability requirements, the term of the affordability requirements to a longer a longer term. And I think that that is something that we should endeavor to replicate at any opportunity that we we have. So that, again, the the the value of the public benefit is more sustaining. Thank you. Thank you so much, Councilmember Harold. Are there any additional comments on Amendment two? Okay. No additional comments. Oh, Councilmember Strauss, please. Thank council president. Much like the last amendment. I am encouraging my colleagues to vote no on this amendment. Came before the committee and did not receive enough support to pass on. This is all. And Councilmember Herbold, I appreciate you bringing this both of these amendments. These were both amendments that we had long conversations about in committee. And it is still my desire to see this program work as it has been written out for a period of a year. I understand that was it was your desire, and I appreciate you bringing forward a better amendment for that last one than what was originally put forward. So I do appreciate that. Again, there is confusion within. Within the community about the length of time. This amendment adds more confusion and clarity with some of these projects that are currently on their way to being being built. So again, I'm not seeing a one year delay in this amendment. Can you. Can you confirm that at this time this would go into effect today? Is that correct? It would go into effect with the passage of the legislation or the the the passage and signing and normal 30 day period. Yes, but you're right, there is no there is no phased implementation. So even more so, I think that through the process of these amendments over the last ten days, we have not had a cohesive stakeholder in process with the amendments, sponsors and the stakeholders, both the builders and the owners. This is an amendment that without the year delay poses, poses risks to projects currently desiring to use the legislation as written by the state so strong strongly encouraging colleagues to put down this amendment. Happy to bring all of this back up in a year or in six months when we have more data about whether this program is being utilized, is being utilized as intended, and if it needs changes. So not opposed to the intent. I'm very supportive of the intent. I am not supporting this amendment at this time and I remain open to future conversations regarding this. Thank you, colleagues. Thank you, councilmember strauss. Any additional comments? An amendment to. I'm not seeing any hands raised, so I'm going to go ahead and move towards calling the roll here. Will the park please call the role on the adoption of Amendment two? Let's get to know. Since then? Yes. So. Yes. Strauss helped. Both. Yes. Lewis. Yes. Morales. No. Council. President Gonzales. No. Four in favor and four oppose. The motion fails for a lack of a majority vote, so it is not adopted. Are there any further comments on the bill as amended? I'm not seen in any other hands raised because we're stressed. You are the sponsor of the bill, so I do want to make sure you get the last word if you would like to have one. Thank you, council president. Just looking forward to this bill passing so that the religious institutions who have been counting on this bill to be passed to move their projects forward. Thank you. Council President. Thank you, colleagues. I urge a yes vote. Thank you so much, Councilman Strauss. All right. Well, please call the role on the passage of the amendment bill. Let's get a. I. Peterson. I. Swans? Yes. Strauss. Yes. We're both. Yes. Lewis. Yes. Morales. As. Council President Gonzales. I wouldn't say none oppose. The bill passes as amended and then sure will sign it will place a fixed signature to the legislation on my behalf. Well, the clerk please read items 13 through 19 into the record.

AN ORDINANCE relating to affordable housing on properties owned or controlled by religious organizations, granting zoning flexibility to affordable housing developments on such land, allowing for additional height and capacity without increasing maximum heights, based on a state bill providing flexibility for institutions to use private funding for affordable housing development. Eligible sites must be owned or controlled by religious institutions, providing affordable housing for households up to 80% of the area median income, with majority projects targeting below 60% AMI due to Office of Housing funding requirements. The ordinance facilitates more possibilities for affordable housing, requiring a subsidy if city funds are utilized for construction. Amendment 1B seeks to lower the average affordable housing income eligibility to 60% of AMI, amended to be effective from July 1, 2022, intending to incentivize non-profit over for-profit developers. Amendment 2 seeks to increase the term of affordability to 75 years from 50 years, but does not pass. The bill passes as amended, enabling religious institutions to proceed with affordable housing projects. Councilmember Strauss encourages support, emphasizing the importance of passing the bill for the benefit of these institutions.

Thank you. The chair recognizes council board chair of the Committee on City Services, Innovation Technology Council barking up the floor. Thank you so much, President Flint. Yeah, we had this hearing last Friday. Christopher Cook, well known to many in this chamber as the city's former chief of environment, energy and open space has been proposed by the mayor for the three person board of the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. So the bottled water and sewer commission is sort of quasi independent. It's got its own budget, it does its own bonding, but it is governed by a three person board that's appointed by the mayor. And this is the seat that's currently up. The remaining two seats are up in early January of next year. The committee heard extensively both from Mr. Cook, who's now the executive director of the Greenway, and from Henry Vitali, who's the executive director, CFO, treasurer of the Water and Sewer Commission. I think the was exciting to learn that Chris has actually already been serving as one of Boston's appointees at the WRI, which is the Water Resource Authority that that Boston Water and sewer really works hand in glove with. So he really already has had some real learning in the systems. And then, of course, you know, what we spent most of the hearing talking about was the need for water and sewer to really shift towards more green infrastructure, green stormwater management. And it really felt as though Mr. Cook's knowledge and experience as a Parks person, thinking through that piece, was going to really stand us in good stead in bringing that green lens to the water and Sewer Commission, in addition to really sort of understanding and empathizing with the nuts and bolts, which, as we discussed, these are the people who manage the guts of the city and it's just super important work to get right. So it was a good hearing. And my recommendation today, Mr. Chair, is that the nomination ought to be confirmed. Thank you. Thank you, Counsel. BLOCK Council.

Okay. As provided for under RTW 42.17 a point 555, the city Council will now consider the adoption of Resolution 31860 that those read into the record. And at the conclusion of Councilmember comments, the Council will hear comments from members of the public who wish to speak on the resolution. This resolution, of course, endorses Seattle School, Seattle School District's Propositions one and two, which relate to operation and building infrastructure funding. On the February 12th, 2019 special election ballot and approximately equal opportunities to to speak will be given to members of the public. Thanks for reading the item into the record and I'll relinquish the floor to Councilmember Johnson. Thanks. I bring this forward on behalf of not only my colleague, Councilmember Gonzales, but also all those of us who are parents of kids in public schools. The two of in front of voters this February present a unique opportunity for us to continue our decades long partnership between the City of Seattle and the school district and its board of directors on complementary investments. And the investments that are in front of voters this February are critical ones. Not only do we have a very, very long list of capital investments that would transform and reconstruct several schools throughout the city. But also we'll make investments in nearly, if not every single school in the city of Seattle. But in addition, the operating levy, commonly referred to as the PTA levy, also has a set of critical operational investments that are necessary for all of our students to excel in all of our Seattle public schools. So there's an ongoing partnership between the city and the school district, I think is a critical one, and I'm super excited to see this ambitious plan on the ballot and looking forward to voting yes myself. Very good. Councilmember Becky Shaw, thank you so much, Mr. Johnson, for your leadership on this. And I'm wondering if you could just hold up that map and the back side of it. There are no. Further people can. Give it to you. Thank you. So what I appreciated about this map, and I'm not sure that we can even begin to have it focused from the Seattle Channel, but this is the number of schools that will be aided by this particular levy. And the back side of it identifies, I mean, almost to the dollar. What kinds of things will be done at each elementary, middle school and high school? So I know that there has been some controversy around this. People are saying, well, how come that the McCleary decision didn't take care of it? Well, then it clearly didn't. McCleary decision didn't take care of it. And so for us to continue to have the great air quality public school system that we want, we need to support this levy. And I'm happy to be doing that. So thank you for bringing this forward. Thank you. Councilmember Herbold, thank you. And I did just want to speak to some of the controversy that Councilmember Bagshaw alluded to. There was a Seattle Times editorial last week that I made some inquiries about. They had to two contentions, one related to the size of the operations levy, and the second related to concern that it would be the levy would be undermining sort of the basic tenet of McCleary, which is to make sure that there is there there isn't unequal funding in school districts across the state where cities with school districts and taxpayers who are willing and able to fund basic education are able to do so more plentifully than other school districts. And what I learned from my inquiry is that it is true that the size of the operations levy, the request in the levy itself is a different number than what they can currently be legally collected. It is in excess of the legally authorized collection amount, but that doesn't mean that they're going to be able to collect all that money. The plan is, again, and I think this is very consistent with the intent of McCleary. The plan is to go back to the state legislature this year to increase the amount that can legally be collected. Under state law. Thus maintaining that strong commitment that we have to make sure that different school districts across the state are not put in different positions depending on whether or not those particular districts are able to to pass. LEVY So in in in essence, increasing the the collection amount gives the Seattle Public Schools some some flexibility because by asking for the additional capacity now, they don't have to go back if the state law is itself changed. And then the other point that I think is important to note that there was a question about the use of the dollars and again, whether or not the use of the dollars is consistent with the legislative decisions made in the legislature last year. And I think it's important to take note that the State Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction approved the Seattle Public Schools plan for the operations levy and took the position that it is, in fact, consistent with state law. Thank you. Thanks for those comments because my HERBOLD, any further comments? If not, we're going to move to public hearing any further comments. Okay. So as required by law, we have to sign up sheets for Proposition one and Proposition two. So I'm going to. Call you out in the order that you sign it. Sign up and we'll start off. Just one moment. Here, give me one sec. Okay. So we'll start off with Mr. Alex Zimmerman and following Mr. Zimmerman will be Melissa Pailthorpe. It's on proposition number one. I have to say she. So should I go to first and second? It's a little bit confusing, I'm sure. Mr. Chairman, I humbly apologize for interrupting. Can you start his time back, please? It may I have to sign up sheets, but the same people sign up for both. And so. Yeah. Why don't we just speak on both of them? No problem. One and two. So you're absolutely. Right. Proposition one and Proposition two. Absolutely. Absolutely right. Yeah. I'm very happy when I see something common sense, which was very unusual in this chamber. So situation right now, very simple. Yes, it's exactly what is I want explained you money need for school so exactly. Absolutely I'm not too much sure how much money this money what we have here, we're talking about billions. My experience with this board of school director. But as I come in circles as pupils, very low, primitive, not professional, we cannot give this people a chance. Operate with billion dollars. We need somebody who's have different opinion. They have same opinion like you should belong in you same principle. Like you use more money. More money in still in mind. Is this exactly what's happened? We are talking about billions and billion dollars. You know, I'm absolutely sure, like profession professional, business consultant, because I don't have speeches for couple of minutes. We have more than enough money. And now in this system, we can fix it every cent, ten times cheaper. Five times cheaper, maybe three times, but much cheaper. So this happen and happen again and again. But what this I want to talk to right now about the of our operation with money in business principle what is every business have government or not government seven under thousand idiot who live in this city deserve a government 7 billion and billion dollars. I'm very happy with this because when 700,000 idiot pay a billion and billion dollars per billion and billion dollars, a billion and billion dollars for transportation for school for every cent in got better. So I'm very happy when this 700,000 natural born degenerate idiot will be a cop and Colin Campbell like you totally in scold but I'd like to totally because of this you look right now is a pure fascism when government together with corporation suck blood and mind you from us stop fascism cleanse this chamber. Stand up, America. Okay, these were all in line with the public now. So Melissa will be followed by Jake Ewert. Hi. My name's Melissa Pailthorpe. I'm the president of Schools. First, the organization that mobilizes the Get Out the vote campaign for the school levies. And here as a volunteer and a parent in our public schools. Thank you all for supporting this resolution. I think council member bags have pointed out that the capital levy has significant funding and improvements for the buildings across the city, which is really critical. We have a number of aging buildings. We've been working on that for a while and we have to keep working on improving those for our kids. And as Councilmember Johnson pointed out, we do have a funding gap between the McCleary solution and what we're able to raise locally. So our E.P.A. levy this year is absolutely critical. And as Councilmember Herbold pointed out, we are asking for additional authority, knowing that we would have to, in fact, have legislative action to collect on that. Seattle is not unique in that several districts are taking this tack because we don't want to have to come back to voters and ask again and spend more resources and time on that. So thank you for your support for our 53,000 kids and appreciate all the work that you're doing. I would also like to remark that this does go hand in hand with the fact, Larry, we need both pieces to make this work in our city. So thank you for that as well. And I want to apologize on behalf of Greg Wang because he had to leave, but that was the point that he wanted to make . So thank you. Thank you, Jake. You are. Hi. My name is Jake Ewert. I'm a volunteer with schools. First you just heard about I'm also a parent of kids in the Seattle Public Schools. I've got a second grader, a kindergartner, and a little guy will be in kindergarten soon. These levees are really important to me, very, very important to the city. The Capitol levee is obviously important to improve and replace some schools in the operations levee. Obviously important to bridge the gap between all the improvements and funding the state has made and the money that public schools need for services. Now, a lot of folks have been moving to this town and will continue moving here, interested in putting their kids in Seattle public schools. It's really important that we continue investing in them. I know one thing about the money that's going to be collected, every single dollar is going to be used to support our kids. So it's a great investment. I urge you to vote yes. Thanks very much. Thank you. And thanks for letting us know Greg was not here, but we did have him, his and Greg on the same street. And Greg, thank you for all the work you're doing. Okay. Seeing no further speakers signed up to speak either in favor or opposition to the resolution. The public comment period for this time will be closed. The Council now proceed with the vote on the resolution 31860. Okay. Those in favor of adopting a resolution 31860. Please vote i i. Those oppose vote no. The motion carries the resolution is adopted than chair will sign it. Thank you very much. With pleasure. Is there any further business coming for the council?

Petition of GID Development Group and the Seattle Department of Parks and Recreation for the vacation of the alley between Lake Avenue, Ninth Avenue and Leonora Street in BLOCK 24. Heirs of Sarah Arpels second edition, the committee recommends for council to grant the petition as conditioned. Thank you, Councilmember Rasmussen. Thank you. This would grant conditional approval of an early vacation in BLOCK 24 is also sometimes known as the Enterprise car rental site at Ninth and Leonora. It's a bit unusual in that the application for the vacation has been made jointly between the private developer guide development and our Seattle Parks Department. Each of the petitioners would take about half of the 2400 square foot alley in the block. The developer private developer guide would take one half of the alley to complete a 400 unit, 400 foot tall residential building on the north side of the block. And the park department would take the other half of the alley to complete a much needed new 10,000 square foot park on the south side of the lot, alongside Westlake Avenue and Leonora Street. It would feature an open lawn and an activity area, place, structure, hillclimb and seating for gathering picnics and general leisure. The Disney Triangle Urban Center Village is being heavily developed, as you know, and more office space will be needed and welcome in this neighborhood all along. Westlake. While the two projects are separate, Jedi and the Parks Department are working closely to design and coordinate the development of this public park. Without a vacation, the opportunity for a complimentary design between the two groups would be lost and the alley would continue to be used for vehicular traffic and would actually be a detriment and a barrier between the residential tower and the new park. With the early vacation, there is an opportunity for many more amenities to be expanded on the block and better public use and public access to the park. Thank you. Questions or comments? Councilmember BENSHOFF. Just one. Councilmember Rasmussen, the last piece of legislation you mentioned that more bicycle racks were going to be added at the location. And I didn't hear you say that this time, but I would like to encourage us to do that where possible. I'm finding that more often than not I am locking my bike to a tree downtown, and if we're really encouraging people to use our spaces, a few more bicycle racks around would be very helpful. Thank you. I believe the the ballot measure that we just approved going to the voters will actually include funding for many, many more bicycle. Bicycle racks. Councilmember Gordon. I just want to say that this is really a parks development. Much more in a lot of respects than a transportation project. Aside from the fact that it was necessary to do grant vacation of the alley. In order to. Do it, but it's going to be harder and harder to get the park spaces downtown. And I think it's really the design is exciting and it's. Going to be really a great. Amenity for the area, which is very heavily now developed. And it will be wonderful to have. This little green. Space in this park right on that spot. When you think about what is. There now. An alley and a car rental park part, a development that has a whole lot of cars parked there. Think about how you're going to have green grass and you're going to have an opportunity to sit out on the sidewalk. It will be quite, quite, quite a good amenity and very pleased that we can have that kind of public, private cooperation. Thank you. Please call the roll. Excuse me. This is a clerk file, so we will.

My motion carries unanimously. Thank you. The next item that was pulled is five F and I pulled that because I wanted to give Alameda point an opportunity actually to share with the public. And I see Rachel in the audience here. But but this is is phase zero a years one and two of what did happen at Alameda Point and what is anticipated to happen in the this coming year. And I think it's important that we share that with our public. Rachel, did you want to say anything? I'm happy to actually would encourage people to go to the point alameda on Facebook and like that. That's where they do post events and they are very strong using social media. But I really want to make sure the public's aware of what's happening there. So this is your opportunity. Thank you so much, Madam Mayor, and members of Council, and I appreciate the opportunity to get together this evening and share an update on our Phase Zero program. Mm. Is this in our materials? Mm. Mm. Yes. It's on the consent calendar. And if you could also highlight your two, because that's where you can make sure everyone's aware of what you're doing. Absolutely. So just to recap, some of the objectives that we are working towards is trying to increase awareness about the project, attract new audiences out to Alameda Point and generate some buzz not only here within the community, but also on a regional basis. So a quick recap of some of the events that we hosted. We really try to work hard to appeal to a wide variety of audiences, from families up to adults and teens. So a couple of quick photos because they can tell a better story than I can of some of the events that we've hosted. This has spanned the gamut from a coastal cleanup on Martin Luther King Day, partnering with the Parks and Rec team on the Clay Herding skateboard tournament, as well as a new street festival that we brought out to Alameda Point, which was called Whimsy Fest. I also wanted to mention that, you know, we had over 14 different events with 11,000 attendees, and we generated some great new partnerships that have brought in new audiences. And we are hoping to continue to have those partnerships continue on through the next year. So. One of the things that we learned through the first year is that we really need to have a home for phase zero. We need to have it there a place that our traffic can grow organically. And we also need to maintain flexibility. So as new programs and new partnerships come up, we can work those into into the Phase zero program. So looking into year two, we're very excited to finally have our home start to come together. This is going to be in front of the Naval Air Museum, some area that we chose very carefully, which has enabled us to tap into some existing infrastructure, be in close to the heart of where there are a lot of audiences currently today, and also steer clear of our Phase one construction, which is kicking off very, very soon. So this home for phase zero is going to include a artfully designed container village. This is designed by the same team that has brought together the yard in San Francisco, which is across the street from Park Bell Park, which has been very, very successful and will bring a new cafe and beer garden and new opportunities for people to enjoy the site's natural attributes of beautiful views of San Francisco, as well as the waterfront, which is an underutilized part of the base right now. So we're going to be reusing some of the murals that were part of Whimsy Fest, and those are going to be brought out. And so that Container Project is going to be the home for our Year two activity calendar. So that includes the return of the pumpkin patch, which brought us 6000 people last year. It will also serve as the home for the American Armed Forces Cup, which is going to come back for a second year. That was a great way to honor our veterans and support the history at Alameda Point. I want to add, the public is very welcome to attend. That is not just for our military and it's a wonderful event. Glad that glad that it was well enjoyed. And now that we will have a home, it will make it a lot easier for us to also have smaller recurring events. So a couple of ideas that we have put on the calendar for next year have included things like Yappy Hour, which is an opportunity to bring your dog out and enjoy, enjoy the scenery as well as outdoor yoga and things like that. So I'm going to breezed through these really quickly. So as I mentioned, we brought back the pumpkin patch, which did very well this year. Again, despite a very rainy October, the American Armed Forces cap. The first one happened in October of this year and just had a first planning meeting for 2017. Skip through the next one. So we will be bringing back a coastal cleanup during Martin Luther King weekend. A point of transition. This was an opportunity to invite a number of artists into some of the buildings that are going to be either torn down or renovated during phase one. So that has already happened. And now we are working on a creative show that will highlight the makers and the creativity out at Alameda Point, which will also include a show of a number of these photographs as well. As a way to enjoy all of the waterfront access that we have. Plans for doing a paddling event. Then come April will be the grand opening of the The Container Project, as well as a return of the Creative Arts Festival. Clay Harding skateboard tournament is on our calendar as well. And then some of the recurring events that we hope will be successful and we can bring back frequently would be outdoor movies. Yappy Hour. And then the outdoor yoga. And so these would be some of the programs that would be happening within the Container Project. So very excited to have a fruitful in the next year. And where do people find you on social media. It is Facebook dot com slash the point. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. I do. We have a motion. So moved. Second. All those in favor. All right. I unanimously. Thank you. I also polled 5ga recommendation to authorize the city manager to amend the Hornet Field Lease License Agreement with the Alameda Soccer Club to include operation and maintenance of the adjacent tennis courts. Four additional soccer field space. And this one, I was hoping that staff could clarify what's going to be happening with the tennis courts out there and what exactly this is amending. Go ahead. Thanks. Good evening, Mayor and Council. My name is Amy Wooldridge. I'm the Recreation and Parks Director. To clarify what we are doing, I've been working with the Alameda Soccer Club, which came to my cellphone and brought to the Recreation and Parks Commission a proposal to renovate the dilapidated tennis courts that are there that are adjacent to the Hornet field, which they currently have a license agreement with the city, a five year agreement that expires in February 2019. What we are proposing is that we that the soccer club be allowed to improve those tennis courts into an interim use. That would be a football type, but a rubberized potential rubberized surface similar to a tennis court surfacing that they then could use for all other play and additional practice space. Again, it's an interim use, which is why we included it as part of the Hornet field lease license agreement so that the use of those tennis courts would be tied to it and could be looked at and reviewed each time the Hornet field license agreement came up for renewal. Are there plans to have tennis courts on the west end of town as part of our community parks? It's not determined yet. Ultimately, we roughly have called that Enterprise Park. It's the triangle area from that basically stretches from about where the Hornet field is out to the internal boat launch facility. And when we have that, the scope and the bandwidth to do so, LAPD would Alameda Recreation Park Department would engage the community in a masterplan process to determine what the community wants to see out there, whether they want to see tennis courts there, or whether we only have tennis courts at the sports complex. There's a lot of master planning to be done out at Alameda Point in for recreation facilities. Are there plans to have tennis courts at the sports complex then? Potentially. But we'll be doing a master plan process for that as well. All right. So currently our tennis court, public tennis courts are only available at Creasey Park. Oh, no, we have. Where else are they? Washington are our largest complexes at Washington. We have them at Lydecker. We have them at Cruisy. We have one single court that now is being used as pickleball courts at Lincoln Park. I feel like I'm missing one. Longfellow. Thank you. And Franklin, the audience is a very good number with the courts are. Always on now. Not so much anymore as what I've heard. Okay, so we do have speakers on this item. Thank you very much. Thank you. Chris Neal. Eugene Demler. Ebola. Ebola. John Paxson. David something. And Scott McCaskill. Chris. You want to go first? You may have up to 3 minutes, but you don't have to take it all. Thank you very much. As many of you know, I was coaching a special needs soccer team this fall. Children with severe mental challenges and physical challenges. With 15 children on their team. We templated the program on the Challenger baseball program. That Little League. And then I assisted a very impressive young man by the name of Easton Woon, who had arranged he's a high school student. He'd arranged with other high school students to provide a similar experience, not competitive, but for younger children. On Saturdays, he and his friends had arranged this, and they've grown it to 30 special needs children. So between our two programs, we have 45 children who are participating. What the army, the soccer club is doing is highly valuable and helpful to us for a number of reasons. First, in the group that I work with, we have a real issue with children taking off and running. These tennis courts are fenced in. So right now we are limited in the number of children we can serve by our number of volunteers. We have to go 1 to 1, one body to one player. Being able to get inside of an enclosed area makes it much, much more manageable. Second, it's a somewhat isolated location, and many of our autistic children become very agitated by noise. So when we're playing on a soccer field where there are other players and other games going on and there's cheering and screaming, so children cover their ears and run off. So being isolated is helpful. Not to mention most of the other fields where we have soccer really don't have many handicapped parking spaces. There's a lot of parking out here which would solve a problem for us. But most importantly, it's a hard, smooth surface which makes it easier for our non-ambulatory players, the players with Down syndrome, the players who are in wheelchairs or walkers who frankly, we couldn't serve this year. So I implore you to let the soccer club spend some money and do this. Thank you very much. We appreciate all the. Thank you, Eugene. Madam Mayor and council members. My name is Eugene Demler. I've been a Alameda resident for 15 years. I'm a business owner in the city of Alameda, and I also have two boys that attend Alameda schools. For the last ten years, I have been involved with Alameda Soccer Club as both a coach in various volunteer capabilities. And then most recently, for the last two years, I've been the president of the organization. This is for those who aren't aware, this is a club of approximately 1300 kids. We are a community based organization. We are solely volunteer based. We don't there's nobody paid on staff. So this club is run by the by the citizens of Alameda. And we're looking for your approval to be able to extend that outreach to the to the to other people in the in the community.",Recommendation to Approve Phase Zero Year 1 Annual Update and Phase Zero Year 2 Activity Plan for Site A at Alameda Point.

Or moving on to 20-05, four or five. It's an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 4228 Kalama Street and 40 to 60 Kalama Street in Sunnyside. Councilmembers say to Barker, Will you please put Council Bill 545 on the floor for passage? I move that council bill 545 be placed upon final consideration and you pass. Thank you. Oh, can I get that second? Thank you. The required public hearing for Council Bill 20-054 or five is open. May we get the staff report, please? Certainly. Good evening, counsel. I'm Brandon Schaefer, presenting the official map amendment application four 4228 and 4260 cattlemen streets rezoning from PD 240 and um x2x2 you are x three. The subject property is located in Council District one in the Sunnyside neighborhood. Again, this request is for you or X3 that is urban neighborhood context residential mixed use three storey maximum height. The subject property is currently an industrial storage lot and a residential duplex measuring just over an acre of land area and is requesting a rezoning to allow for future residential development. Existing zoning on the site is primarily 50 to 40, which I will detail on the next slide. And um, matched to X which stands for urban mixed use two storey maximum height with limited commercial uses. Many of the uses allowed in this district are tailored to ensure compatibility with the established residential neighborhood. Adjacent zoning is new to you. See, you are age 2.5 and industrial mixed use across the alley in the form of I am x three. So Peabody through 40 was approved in 1988 and it is based on the former Chapter 59, a07 zone district that contemplates the construction of a building of no more than 15,300 square feet for light manufacturing and office uses. This beauty also includes maximum floor area ratio and height, a minimum primary street setback, as well as requirements for parking, sidewalks, landscaped areas and building coverage. Current land uses of the subject properties are industrial and two unit residential adjacent land uses include single and two unit residential, industrial and office. These photos give you a sense of building form and scale with the subject properties on the left, residential structures across columns on the bottom right, and a mix of residential and industrial structures across the alley that are pictured on the top. Right. This table shows a side by side comparison of the existing zone districts versus the proposed zone district. The proposed zone district three provides the townhouse and shopfront building forms and allows for an increase in height of 15 feet for a maximum of three stories and 45 feet. Speaking to the process. Informational notice of this application was sent in February and a revised application was submitted in late April. Planning Board voted unanimously to move this case forward at their meeting on June 3rd. Notice of today's meeting was sent on July 20th. So after the preparation of the staff report in this presentation, we did receive three letters from nearby property owners in support of this rezoning. Now moving to the criteria. These are the four plans that impact the subject property, starting with comprehensive plan 2040. The proposed rezoning is consistent with many of the strategies in this plan, which are organized by vision elements that would allow for an increase in allowed housing density near the 41st and FOX stations, consistent with the equitable, affordable and inclusive goals and strategies. Similarly, the proposed zoning would allow for a broader variety of uses that in intensity consistent with the desire for an urban, walkable, mixed use community which fits into the strategies and goals in the strong and authentic neighborhoods. Vision element. Lastly, the land use patterns mentioned are consistent with the number of strategies and the environmentally resilient element, and therefore staff finds the request consistent with Plan 2040. Moving to Blueprint Denver. The subject property is mapped as part of the urban neighborhood context. This context is described as containing small multi-unit, residential and low unit, low intensity, mixed use buildings embedded in single unit unit residential areas. As the proposed zone district is primarily intended to accommodate residential uses, the request is appropriate and consistent with the blueprint context. The Future Places MAP designates the properties as low, medium residential. These properties are. This designation, rather is described as having aspirational characteristics of the low medium residential area. Having a mix of low and mid-scale residential options and limited mixed use is allowed along some arterial and collector streets into intersections. Consistent with this guidance, the proposed district provides for a variety of residential options and allows for limited commercial uses. All the streets that surround the subject properties are classified as local or in designated. And my street, which is one block to the west, is classified as. A residential collector. As your x three is primarily residential. Request to district is consistent with the future street types at this location. The subject property is also located within all other areas of the city and blueprint Denver. These areas are projected to account for 10% of jobs and 20% of new households in the city by 2040. The proposed rezoning will provide additional housing units and offered the opportunity for additional jobs, which is an appropriate change given these growth goals for the rezoning is consistent with the blueprint. Denver Future Growth Areas Plan Direction. Moving to the station area plan. This was adopted in 2009 and sets forth the vision for the creation of a diverse, transit, supportive and environmentally sustainable urban center in the Land Use Concept Map. Subject properties are mapped as urban residential 1 to 3 stories. These areas are intended to create an improved edge for the adjacent residences and calls for a range of housing types, including single unit accessory dwelling units, duplexes, townhomes and small condominium and apartment buildings. Therefore, this rezoning request is consistent with both the land use and building types. Recommendation and station area. The last plan is the Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan, adopted in 1992 that identified the subject properties as industrial and estates, the need for increased or improved buffers to separate the industrial and residential areas. At the time this plan was written in the nineties, the subject property was owned up to 40, which allowed for the industrial and office uses and b one on the corner of 43rd and Kalama, which allowed for limited office. Therefore, the proposed district is consistent with this plan as it follows allows for a range of residential building forms and improves the buffer between the local neighborhood to the west and the industrial areas to the north. And to these. Staff also finds the requested zoning meets the next two criteria, as it will result in the uniformity of district regulations and will further public health, safety and welfare for the implementation of adopted plans and facilitating increased housing density near bus and rail transit services. There are two justified circumstances for this rezoning. The first being changed and changing conditions in the surrounding area. Recent physical changes include the opening of the rail station in 2019 and the multi-use path along the street that connects the neighborhood to downtown. The second justifying circumstance points to the majority of the site, which is currently zoned 50 to 40, retaining former Chapter 59 zoning after the city adopted the Denver Zoning Code in 2010. Overall, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood contexts that exist in the surrounding area and with the purpose and intent statements. City staff recommends approval based on planning that all review criteria have been met. I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you, Brandon. Tonight Council has received two written comments on Council Bill 545. There are two submitted comments in favor of the application and no submitted comments in opposition of the application. All council members that are present have certified that they have read each of the submitted written comments. Do any members need more time in order to read all of the written testimony that has been submitted? Seen none. Madam Secretary, let the record reflect that all written testimony submitted regarding Council Bill 545 has been read by each member of council, and all written testimony has been submitted to the official record of the hearing. We have one individual signed up to speak tonight, Matt Giovanni. And I believe he is the applicant. And we were going to. See if he would raise his hand. There's one phone call. PARTICIPANT So we're. Trying to see if Matt is here. All right. It looks like we don't have Matt here, and so we don't have any speakers for this hearing tonight. Questions from members of council. We have Councilman Ortega. Well, your mutant. I. Okay. There we go. I wanted to ask Brennan a question about. Sort of where that line is. In the Sunnyside neighborhood, where the height and the encroachment of sort of ends, if you will, we know that the light rail stop shares, you know, both the sunny side and the Globeville side of that that rail corridor. But I'm just curious. When CPD identifies that the 20% has been met by a specific neighborhood, for example, some neighborhoods are growing exponentially because of their proximity to rail. But does that take into account that 20%? So help me understand those two things. Where's that sort of boundary line on the western edge of the rail? So really the sort of eastern end of the neighborhood, but the west end of rail, so that it doesn't just keep continuing to encroach into the single family fabric of the neighborhood. And then when is that 20% threshold met? Sure. So your first question. If you. Work at the stationary plan and then kind of as we see these resources come in piecemeal, I think that it's fair to say that the encroachments really stop that Chalamet Street, that's where we really don't have any plans to offer more guidance and free stories. And then it gradually increases as you move over a couple of blocks to the east. And I believe the most intense is along Inca streets. So does that include the west side of Columbus or does it end on the eastern side of Chalamet? The stationary plant. I believe ends at the Western. So that was east of Callum Street towards towards the rail track. Okay. Okay. And then to the question about observing, you know, growth and and housing and and jobs, that really I think is more of an aspirational number. And it's something that we try to keep track of at a city wide bubble every year. And we do an annual update or report to blueprint number. I don't really think that there's it's not really meant to serve as a calculation of when the neighborhood gets there that will stop, you know, supporting rezonings in that area once we see that magic number get set. So for me, part of part of why looking at the 20% by neighborhoods where we're seeing a lot of growth happen becomes important is because historically KPD has looked at the project. Piecemeal project by project, not at a neighborhood holistically and looking at the cumulative impact and whether or not this results in major infrastructure issues that have to be addressed. This is along a corridor where we have the Utah Junction outfall, which is a storm drainage corridor, where a lot of that water sort of flows down towards this area. And so, you know, understanding how the city's looking at the infrastructure, not just roads, but what, you know, storm drain and any of the other issues where upgrades need to occur. And we don't wait and then just expect the city to foot the tab where we should be looking at the areas a little bit more holistically like we're trying to do at the 41st and Fox area. So that's why I bring that up and just wanted to kind of hear what the thinking of CBD is as we sort of bump up to that ceiling of that 20% or really start to exceed it significantly in certain neighborhoods. So thank you. I have no further questions or comments. Thank you, Councilwoman. Councilwoman Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. So, Brendan, did you say is the applicant on the line? I thought they were. Can we try to look for him again, Mac? We can. Matt, if you are in the attendance, please raise your hand. All right. It looks like we have Matt and we'll get him. And you did. Okay, ma'am. Good evening. Hi. Good evening. Councilman Sandoval had a question for you. Could you repeat that again, please? Hey, Matt. How are you? Councilman Tannenbaum. How are you? Good. Thanks for joining us tonight. So can you talk to us a little bit about the community process that this site has gone through and what the plans are for it? Sure. So we started back in October of 2019, really looking at what the neighbors wanted out of the site before we made any plans to the. We sat through several of the meetings. And neighbors Councilwoman Sandoval and that the community organization at large. We held a couple of conversations with outside and looking at what we could do with the project itself, really trying to create that transition neighborhood as we step towards the to the library and to the overall community, what was going to be better served with a stepping up of buildings versus jumping up to five stories? So we also heard from that the number of streets for the second or third work are stronger piece for this because of people moving through the neighborhood to get to the. So what we've we've done extensive outreach and met with the RINO's multiple times and will continue to do so as we move through the SDP portion. Our intent is to develop the property and we will be taking those next steps after this decision. And did I miss it? Did you see what you were developing the property into? We currently do not know what the project will become given the time of COVID. We have reevaluated some of the offerings as well as look at what is coming in the next several months from projects around the city to consider, condos to address, and larger spaces and potentially larger apartments to offer a diversity of product to to the neighborhood. And then it was good. Remind me. Are you doing that for the affordable housing? Are you paying the linkage fee or did you guys come to a decision with the neighborhood about building an on site and affordable? We have opted to go towards the addressing that at the time of SDP. We don't yet know what the final metrics of the building are because of the square footage. And we reach out to both and financing companies to understand how we could cover that affordable housing piece. But we have not yet at this time figured that financial aspect of this project out. And is there one owner or multiple owners of the proposed site? There are multiple owners. We the the LLC that is we were representing controls 7/8 of the block. The last corner piece is a single family owner duplex property that we do not control, but we felt that was necessary to come into the council with a complete thought for the entire block so that there was not a small to parcel remnant of older zoning with the. Amex property. And have they discussed about wanting to redevelop or are they okay with their use by right what they have going on. Currently there are in use by right. And we've not made any overtures to take that property. We don't. We're not we're not trying to force them out of that property at this time. And is the developer the funder is the developer or the person who's doing the building or would they sell it to a different developer? I mean, is the property owner the developer sorry. For a property owner is intending to develop themselves probably with a junior partner to help with the vertical. Okay. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilman Ortega. That raised a couple last last minute questions. So the single family property that is included in the red zone application and they were fully aware and okay. Being included. Can you clarify that? Yes. So we've met with several times at the beginning, back in October. We also looked at the adjacent properties on to the east on the other side of the alley to join us. At that time, they chose to not join us, but it was by the owner of that small parcel that they accepted. To join our our rezoning. Okay. So we're up zoning their property, but they're not part of the assemblage of what would be developed. Correct. Correct. The assemblage today is effectively a vacant parking lot that's used for industrial storage. So not of use really fitting within the neighborhood as it stands today, as it transitions to a more residential commercial district. But there is no displacement of existing homes and no change of that. We just need to move from the existing PD that limits us to effectively only building a warehouse building and move that to something more suitable for the neighborhood today. Okay. And can you tell me if you all have pursued conversations with the Colorado Housing Finance Authority about low income tax credits as part of a way to do either? The affordable is that would be required under the city's linkage fees or to just incorporate more affordable housing on the site. So we did reach out to hosts to see what funding mechanisms they may be able to offer. The current construct of host only allows for 100%, 30% AMI so the entire building has to be serving some very low to no income product. So it's really funding things like DHEA and other avenues that development is occurring. So just interrupt. Host and the Colorado Housing Finance Authority or two completely different entities. And yes, oftentimes the city does have money into projects that go before. But that the question was about whether or not you had approached Chapel about the possibility of looking at an application to secure some income tax credits for the project. So we haven't gone very far with. A lot of them want to see our final project to understand what kind of gap they can provide for us, because we are so early in this process and we don't know what the final configuration of the building will be. It's very difficult to even show this to a lender to say, can we can we get financing right now? And just the last question. So what prevents you from getting the zoning and then just flipping the property for highest and best value? There are no mechanisms that stop us from that effort. But being that we've put through and worked diligently with the neighbors to establish this and in good faith, we. We intend to develop this project. Great. Thank you. I have no further questions. Appreciate your answering. Your. All right. Thank you, Councilwoman. The public hearing for council bill 20 dash zero five, four or five. It's closed comments by members of council. All right.

Good evening. I'm John Looper with Department of Housing Stability. Awesome. Thank you so much for coming up tonight. Very excited about these dollars for motel vouchers have had some challenges when recommending this option to constituents because we're not really sure who to direct them to and how to know when we've spent down our vouchers. And so I'm wondering if in the coming year if there's any new infrastructure electronically that's being built to track our our vouchers in real time? Or how do we as city council representatives know what's left in our voucher bank when we're trying to connect constituents to these emergency services? So for as far as like an electronic way of tracking or a voucher bank, we don't really have that set up yet. That's something we could look into in the future. This specific contract is really for the family motel, which is for 30 rooms. That's that's kind of it's. It's managed between the Volunteers of America, our office, Department of Housing, Stability, and then Department of Human Services. So Human Services has different outreach workers that write the vouchers to this program. And then Volunteers of America also has a an evening voucher rider that. All right. Vouchers to this program also and they work out of Samaritan House every evening. So how do we know what our usage is throughout the year? So for this this specific contract, it's pretty much 100% use. I think the the occupancy is in the high nineties and they serve about just over a thousand families within a year. There are a couple of other contracted motels and that's kind of as an add need basis as the this family motel fills and they have to overflow into other motels that are contract motels. So when you say 100% utilized, what does that mean? Does that mean that they're 100% full right now and we have a waiting list or what is that? They're in the high nineties for their utilization. So at some nights they're at 100%. And we're we're sending families to contracted motels. The other motels other nights they might be 90% full. And so it just kind of varies night to night. Average stay is about ten days. So families there, though, some of them may stay for just a night. Some of them may stay for 2 to 3 weeks, depending on the needs of that family. And so is there with this specific one, are there preconditions of. Service. Or. How do you how do you qualify to get into. This? So really, if if a family is homeless in Denver, there could be. A man or woman. As long as they have children and they're homeless in Denver, they just need to connect with the Department of Human Services with their general assistance program Monday through Friday through from, I believe it's eight four. And then if they aren't at Denver, Human Services between that timeframe, they would utilize Samaritan House with the voucher riders that are there in the evenings and they'll they'll ask questions. Usually if people are residents of Denver or they're homeless in Denver, they can get multiple nights and then they can meet with a staff member to look at some kind of future planning for them if they're from out of state. They're usually always given one night. And then there we figure out what the next steps would be for that family. So before we send somebody to the Samaritan House. Or Denver Human Services. How do we know if we're at the 90% or 100%? Because it's hard to send someone who has very little resources to a Denver Human Services spot during the day knowing that that night there are not going to be any vouchers. Who do we contact? So that would be during the day. It'd be it would be human services, general assistance. And I don't have that number handy, but just through Human Services, the General Assistance Department, they'll be able to answer that question. It's hard to contact Volunteers of America in the evening to find that out because they're they're seeing people as they're coming in. We don't. I think what you're getting at is we don't really have like a like a system that's showing the actual users. They keep track of that on hand as people are coming in. So that's something that could be improved. Is there a plan for that? I'm not sure. So there's a are the Department of Housing Stability, they're going through a strategic planning process. And part of that's going to be the shelter strategy planning. And so that may be part of that. Some it's as simple as Google forms. If the providers could all get on the same page, it would be really helpful for the rest of us trying to be that broker for services. So thank you. Okay. You're welcome.","A resolution approving a proposed Second Amendatory Agreement between the City and County of Denver and Volunteers of America Colorado Branch for to provide emergency short-term shelter.

See 16340 and declare ordinance amending table 31 dash to a residential development standards in Section 21.31.255 of Title 21 of the Long Beach Municipal Code relating to development and design standards applicable to properties in the R-1 Zoning District. Read for the first time and laid over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading District eight. Thank you, Mr. West. Thank you. Members of the City Council. The staff report was given by Linda Tatum. Good evening. Vice Mayor Richardson and members of the city council staff is here this afternoon to present a zoning code amendment that is was requested by city council. And I'd like to provide a brief recommendation and staff presentation and some of the recommendations that came out of this effort. This area is for the area of the city that is zoned r one. L This is generally known as the Virginia Country Club area of the city, or Los Cerritos, depending on who you talk to. This area is very unique in the city in that it is the only area in the city that is zoned r one IL and there are 6647 properties in this area. And the area is generally bound by country club, country club drive on the north and on the west, and there are a couple of discontinuous parcels in that neighborhood. The first one is the area that I'm pointing to here. If you could see the red dot, that area is just directly north of the Virginia. I'm sorry, the lower cerritos. The lower cerritos. The loss of real property. That area is discontinuous from the rest of the property and then on the north and east of the property, it's called Country Club Lane. If you could see that area there, that area is off of Long Beach Boulevard. So included in that 647 properties are all of these properties. And this area is very unique, as I mentioned earlier, as it's the only area in the city that zoned r one ill. And this area was very specifically designated as a unique area for the purpose, because it it does have the very the most largest lots in the city. And it's also designated in the zoning code specifically for large lot and large estate homes. It was designated that way in the city's general plan. And that's clearly the intent of this area to have the very expansive an estate type homes. Just to give you a few facts and figures about this area, the area the approximate lot size in this area or the average lot size of those 647 is approximately one 1100 square feet I'm sorry, 11,000 square feet. That's the average lot size in the area. However, within that area, the the lot size is very everything from as small as 8000 all the way up to more than 30,000 square feet. So you can see it's quite a range of lot sizes that are encompassed within the neighborhood. And likewise there's a large variety of home sizes in the neighborhood and that varies. Everything from less than 2000 square feet all the way up to the largest home in the neighborhood is approximately it's just over 8000 square feet. So we talked a little bit about the unique character of the neighborhood and how it's designated in the zoning code specifically for large lot in a state properties. Just to give you a little bit of history on this, back in September of 2015, the city council adopted a moratorium for this area, and that moratorium was in response to a a request by the neighborhood to have the city staff look at the zoning and development standards for the area, specifically as they relate it to neighborhood character. And that included issues or concerns regarding the sizes of the homes, the setbacks and other development standards that are currently in the city's zoning code. That moratorium limited development in the neighborhood to no more than 1500 square feet until such time as the City Council could act on recommendations for potential changes to the zoning development standards from the city staff and the City Planning Commission. In August of 2016, the City Council extended that moratorium in order to allow staff additional time to work with the community residents. So I'd just like to briefly go over this timeline. During that period, the staff was engaged in extensive outreach with the neighborhood. That outreach included a number of meetings with the Low Cerritos Preservation Committee in the neighborhood, and we also had a series of public meetings. And during those public meetings, we had the first of those public meetings was in September of 2016, when staff essentially had a listening session to hear for the first time in a broad community settings, some of the concerns from the neighbors. And the second meeting that we had was in November of 2016. And the purpose of that meeting was to provide preliminary recommendations about the zoning code standards that staff recommended would be changed. We followed that up again in December with a study session with the city's planning commission. The initial proposed amendments were presented to the Planning Commission in a study session, and we followed that up with a public hearing before the Planning Commission in February of 2017. And there was a second planning commission public hearing in February of 2016. I'd just like to point out that during this entire period of time, staff did extensive research. We looked at other cities and development standards and other single family neighborhoods and other cities around the state and within the Los Angeles region. And we also communicated directly with members of the neighborhood and took feedback from the neighborhood. And those recommendations, based upon that extensive research in the regarding what's the existing conditions in the neighborhood, the homes sizes, the lot sizes, the potential impacts. We also brought in a an architect to to consult with us, to assist us in developing those standards. And the result of that is a series of recommendations that I'd like to walk through. Before I do that, though, I'd like to acknowledge that staff worked really hard, hard on this effort for the last year. And that team of staff was myself, including Mark Hungerford, who was the lead planner on this effort, and our current planning officer, who was Carrie Tai. And with that, I'd like to walk you through the recommendations that staff came up with. The first of those recommendations is a proposal to modify this, the front yard setback. And this graphic here shows you the orange, if you can. I don't know if you can see it clearly, but there's a difference. You can see in the existing front yard, setback has 20 feet, meaning the house has to be set back from the public, right where the sidewalk at least 20 feet staff's recommendation was that a 25 feet was to modify that to increase the setback by five feet. And this recommendation was strongly supported by the neighborhood. We did get some other opinions from the neighborhood, but this is the recommendation we settled on. And I just tell you, one of the other unique things about the low Cerritos neighborhood is the fact that this neighborhood uniquely has what we call special setbacks. So when we're saying modify the setback from 20 to 25 feet, that acknowledges that in some areas and on some streets in that particular neighborhood, they have a special setback that could be as large as a minimum of 20 and it can go all the way to 50 feet. So in this case, we're recommending that there be a minimum setback of 20, 25 feet for the front yard. The second recommendation that came out of our effort was a proposed side yard setback, and that side yard setback is currently at six feet. So that means on either side of your building, on the side property line, the minimum requirement is six feet. Staff's recommendation was bifurcated or broken into two parts four lots that were less than 60 feet. The recommendation was to maintain that that 60 feet. However, for lots that were greater than that had a larger street frontage than 60 feet, that that side yard set back be a minimum of ten feet or 15% of the lot with and that the idea there was to give greater privacy between between lots that had a a lot directly adjacent to them. So that is staff's proposal for the side yard setback. One other component of the side yard setback is we realize that on corner lots were lots that faced or street there was a need or there was a strong recommendation from the community that that on the street corners that there be a greater setback. And after looking at this again in some detail, the recommendation from staff was that on the corner setbacks, that that setback be increased to ten feet. And that's what you're seeing here in this slide. The orange, again, represents the increased setback and you can see it in a corner configuration here on the top, oops. On the top is a corner lot configuration. And on the bottom you can see when you have a front yard setback on a diagonal street such as San Antonio in the lower Cerritos community. Lastly, a lot of discussion was provided regarding the topic of floor area ratio. The floor area ratio is the mathematical relationship between the area of the dwelling and the size of the lot. Essentially what that does is is govern or to assure that there is some proportionality between the size of the unit and the size of the lot. The current floor area ratio in the city's standard across the entirety of the r1l zoning district is 8.6, which essentially means that you multiply by 0.6 the size of the lot. For example, if you had a 10,000 square foot lot at a point six FSR, you could build a 6000 square foot unit. So the current FFR recommended or the current FFR in the zoning code is point six. And staff's recommendation is that the are increase or decrease to be smaller to allow a smaller unit into that that go down to a point five. And again we bifurcated that so that four lots that were less than 15,000 square foot, they would have a 0.5 ratio. Again, to use the example, if your lot is a 10,000 square foot lot, the point five would reduce the size, the maximum size of the home to 8.5, which is a 5000 square foot home size. And what you can see here is generally within the neighborhood, we've calculated that the current average affair in the neighborhood is a point three for lot sizes, 0 to 15000. And the highest that exists out there today is a point seven within this lot size range. The second part of the FBR recommendation is for lots that are greater than 15,000 square feet. And in the neighborhood, there are 94 properties that are greater than 15,000 square feet. And that current air I talked about earlier is a point six. And the recommendation here is that the FAA, RB decreased to a point four. And again, just some facts and figures related to what's currently existing on the ground. The current FAA are in the neighborhood as a point to two. And the highest, if they are in the neighborhood, is a .43. That just gives you an idea of what's currently on the ground in the neighborhood. The last recommendation from staff was regarding the lot size. There was a lot of concern in the neighborhood that because a lot sizes are quite large related to other lots in the in the city. But not more importantly that if two large lots were merged, you could conceivably have a lot in the middle of the block that was completely out of scale and out of character with the rest of the block and conceivably with the rest of the neighborhood. In order to address this. Staff looked at the current minimum lot size standard, which is 12,000 square feet. And right now there is no maximum lot size standard, but there is a lot size minimum. So the proposal that staff is recommending is that there be a merger of no more than two lots in the neighborhood and that the merged lot site can. The merged lot size cannot exceed 20,000 square feet. And again, what you see in the detail here is just a breakdown of some of the things, the number of various lot sizes within the 0 to 15 category there. You can see that this is the size of most of the lots in the neighborhood. There are 553 lots within the 0 to 15 size standard and then there are 50 lots that are between 15 and 20,000 and there are 44 lots that are 20,000 square feet or greater. Lastly, in the what I've just reviewed for you were some of the development standards that relates the size and the the amount of lot or the amount of structure that could be built on the property. What I'd like to cover now really briefly are some of the design standards, and these relate to the look how the lot looks and how it relates to the surrounding properties. These are design standards and they are essentially pretty basic in terms of how when staff reviews a property, the kinds of things we look for. But these are not currently in the code and staffers recommending that these design standards be added. However, they're not added to every single new home that we consider reviewing, but they are only for the very largest lots. So this would apply if a home was proposed to be 5000 square feet in size or if it's within ten feet of its maximum FSR. And I'll briefly go through these. They are just that we would be looking to make sure that there is four sided architecture on the design that assures that someone, if they have a large home like this, that the that the architectural attention would go to all sides of the building and not just to the front. To maintain the integrity of the architectural style. The other one is related to making sure that there are not large expanses of blank walls without any articulation or any design features. So the second standard is to make sure or to make sure that no expanse of any wall greater than 25 feet occurs without some articulation or some design feature. That's the second standard. The third is that the primary facade or the primary interest to the building should be oriented to the street. And this precludes a property from having a front door on the side of the house. And again, it speaks to, again, best practices in terms of architectural design and neighborhood character, in terms of how the house is oriented to the street. And the other part of that relates to the height of the porches and the entryways to the home, that those not exceed 15 feet again, so that the front door has some relationship to the rest of the architecture of the building. And lastly, the the final design standard that staff thought was appropriate. Again, all of these are based upon feedback from the neighbors is the issue of privacy. So what we're asking is that for the second story, windows that the bedroom windows of the the proposed new structure not line up directly with the existing bedroom windows of the adjacent property. Again, this addresses the issue of privacy. So that concludes the standards that staff is recommending. I would just like to confirm or at least make sure that the that you're aware that these standards, if they are adopted by the city council, they, of course, would not be retroactive. They would not apply to any of the existing units or the design of any existing homes. However, they would apply if a property owner came in to build a new unit or an expansion of an existing unit. And again, these standards would only apply to the extent that the expansion or the new unit triggered any one of those particular standards that staff has recommended. With that, I'd like to conclude the staff's presentation and recommend that the City Council affirm the recommendation of the Planning Commission and accept categorical exemption number c e 16 340 and also that they approve this recommended zoning ordinance amendment to modify the five development standards that I just walked through, as well as the four design standards that were recommended. And that concludes staff's presentation. And Mark and myself are here to respond to any questions you might have. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Tatum, for those comments. So now we will go to public comment. Is there any public comment on the proposal on this hearing? Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the Council. My name is Karen Miller. I've lived in the Los Cerritos neighborhood for 20 years and I also sell real estate in. That little Cerritos. Neighborhood. I am here tonight to urge you to please support the recommendations by the planning staff. City planners have worked with preserve lists of widows for over two years, diligently to come up with compromises to help preserve the quality of our neighborhood, the green spaces. And also without infringing on any homeowners rights. I think we've got a pretty good plan. But you'll hear from people. Tonight that oppose it. And the reason I know this is I received this flier on Sunday. It says it all caps. Attention, homeowners. City Hall is trying to take your property. Well, that's. Just not true. I think what we've come up with is a. Very good plan. And I urge you to please support it. Thank you. Any further public comment? If anyone would like to speak on this matter, could you come forth now so that we have an understanding of how many people are expect to speak? All right, ma'am, I'll give you your name and go ahead and proceed. Hi. My name is Renee Hunt, and I live in the area that we're talking about. And first of all, thank you for the introduction for the Councilwoman Price for the New Year and Happy New Year. And in that uniqueness that we celebrated tonight, our neighborhood is a unique neighborhood and 85 plus years, I know my home is that old or near there. And I think the zoning that we have is really served us well, although I do appreciate the time and effort put in by the employees of the city and they have been very responsive and kind in their meetings and I appreciate that and very professional. I don't believe in limiting the use of the land, as we saw in the slides with the FAA, are reducing the fear that a property owner can use. Now, I don't think that's needed. And also as an interior designer, I have difficulty accepting the design treatment and finish restrictions. And I know some of my colleagues in like San Marino area and Pasadena have come across some of these issues for zoning that's happened there. And a lot of their clients have bought specifically for that neighborhood. But then when coming against these hurdles have decided to move out. It was just too much to follow through with the plans that they had. So I think that. It wouldn't be fair. Our neighborhood. Well, I think we've done great so far. It's a desired neighborhood and I think the zoning has done as well so far. So I hope you would consider that in your votes. And I appreciate your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. And if everyone could come a little bit closer. So we have an understanding on how many people are lined up to speak. Hi, I'm Polly Thomas. I've lived in Long Beach for 32 years. This is the third time in all that that I've spoken at a city council meeting. So it's a rare occurrence and it's also very nerve wracking. It takes a lot to come down here to speak. I am concerned about this proposal. And the first part, I do consider it a taking of the property because the homeowners will not be able to use it as they were able to use it. 10 minutes before your vote. So that's one thing. The second thing is that I am surprised that this is not being handled as a zone code, which usually requires, if I understand correctly, the signature of every homeowner. But it's been explained to me by the Planning Department who I will say have all been very professional, polite and friendly and a pleasure to do, to work with. But it was explained to me that they got around that requirement by calling it a zone code amendment, and for that reason, it doesn't require every homeowner's signature. So I am perplexed as to why you would even want to do that when we are limiting what homeowners can do on their property that they own the. The second thing is that I just want to thank you for your time and consideration. And I do think that someone said here that they had been working on this for two years. And the first inkling I received of this was in August of 2015 and did reach out to the planning department, but there was a changeover and who was handling the project. So no one was involved in an opposition to this matter until really October of 2016. And I think that that is remiss and something that we should take into consideration before making such sweeping changes for this district. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Jeanie Williamson I've been a resident of the Virginia Country Club area for 35 years, and this has been interesting for me to to be in the committee. I have a couple of hats here tonight. I'm on the board of the ALCINA, which is the Little Cerritos Neighborhood Association, in which you'll hear from later, because we do support this, you know, and we have we are a neighborhood association of the whole r1l not just portion of it all the whole part, but also is being on the committee. And I got to tell you, a couple of years ago, okay, 30 figure 35 years of the neighborhood and this I one as held up well until about five years ago then we started seeing homes built on the whole lot, you know, and especially on a main street where as a corner house itself, there was only supposed to be a four foot leeway with that's hardly room from the sidewalk with you're not hitting a wall then and taking up the whole area now envision the peninsula, okay, in Long Beach where they've taken the single story homes and they put the home on that whole lot up there. That's what we're starting to see. And I'm. Are you going to see like two homes like that that totally takes away from the character of our neighborhood and the front yard and the spaciousness and that country club kind of feeling that we all buy into. It's one of your last remaining areas of Long Beach that is like that. And what makes me sad is to see neighbors now who have said that they haven't been informed. But this has been an excellent process the whole time we've been talking in the concerts in the park. We've gotten our 300 signatures last summer, 200 more signatures. When you talk one on one, they understand. Like when I first started this process, I didn't know what an FA was, you know, but now, now I understand it and now I can see it. And it is to maintain that because what I wanted to try to express to you is up until now, the r1l has worked, but you have developers, you have speculators moving in like you see, they find a small home, they'll build up the two stories, you know, and it will become like the peninsula. And like many, many areas of Los Angeles, like you see along the beach areas and I'm sat with my neighbors the misconceptions that they may have. And I like to encourage you if there's something that you don't understand and I know you do this anyway, but if there's something specific that you hear that you don't understand , please ask Linda or Mark, you know, and they will really clear it up for you. I like for you to understand it. Thank you for your time. And oh, I want to add one less thing about design. You know, if you look at these designs that the Planning Department has added into that, you know, we were basically are setbacks and front setbacks and all that really. You know, it's what designers are going to have a problem with your window looking into your neighbors window. I think these are very simple, cated, simple designs, not specifically going to hurt any particular type of architecture. Thank you so much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening. Honorable council members and vice. Mayor. My name is Barbara showing 4120 Locust Avenue. We've lived in our home since 1972 in Virginia Country Club and we love the neighborhood. When we came for you about a year and a half ago to. Ask for the moratorium, as I recall, several of you actually. Mentioned you were particularly. Interested in this issue because mansion ization. Has become an issue not just in Los Cerritos, but in parts other parts of Long Beach. I was talking to a friend who lives in Castle Heights. She said, I don't want mansions. In my neighborhood. I see the and they have a historic district. So there. But in in Belmont Heights and Park Estates and there are other. Areas of the. City where I know that this. Is also an issue. So what we do in Los Cerritos may be an example, but it's not just here. It's all over Los Angeles County. If you read The Times, you see it all the time where communities are concerned about this. As was mentioned. Before, we were concerned. About flippers. Coming in, buying a little house, building a big one, making lots of money and leaving. And that's not in the. Best interest of the. Neighborhood. I wanted to also thank the staff. Mark and Linda and Carrie have been phenomenal. They've come out, they've walked around. They've seen our. Concern. They've worked with us very carefully. We get everything we want it know. Do they know? We work together and negotiated to. We came up with. What we think all. Think are very. Reasonable standards. And so we feel that with the staff we've come up with modest. Yet reasonable modifications to prevent inappropriately oversize. Homes. And I want to make clear one other thing, because there seems to. Be some misunderstanding. And that is. That only if you're in a historic. District or you will have a formal homeowners association. Like Park Estates do. Can the city have any control over the type of architectural design features? We have a neighborhood association, as was mentioned, but we can't control what kind of roof, what kind of siding, what kind of windows? Nothing like that. Only historic districts and homeowners associations can do that. So with that. I'll just thank you for. Their time and urge you to adopt the recommendations. And I want to. Particularly thank our. Wasden, because you've been wonderful. Listening to us, I think listening to everybody. And hearing all of our concerns. And so l thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Esteemed Council persons and Vice Mayor Richardson. My name is Stacy McDaniel. I reside at 4110 Cedar Avenue. I'm also a member of the Preserve Lost three. This committee formed when over 200 of our. Neighbors voiced opposition. To some of the new construction being built in the. Neighborhood. I support. The changes to the R-1 L zoning. Standards and commend. The Planning Department for their professionalism. And extensive outreach to the. Community. Would all those in the audience who. Also support these changes briefly stand? Thank you. The proposed changes are all about controlling out of scale development and have nothing to do with imposing design standards on the neighborhood. This is what I look at every day. After the. Prior owners of my the next door house who bought an existing. One story home. Built it. To the maximum degree. Permitted under the current. Standards and flip it. Our property is a third in the shadow about half of the year caused by this plaster chunk. These are some examples of what our. Neighbors are concerned about. Basically homes that do not fit the scale of the neighborhood. Even this one, which tends to be the lightning. Rod for controversy, might be okay if it was up by. The country club. But the fact of the matter is that it was built in the middle of a. Block on three aggregated lots, and it's grossly out of. Scale to its neighbors. It is, in fact, almost. Four times larger than the adjacent neighbors. There's nothing personal against that owner or any owner or opposition. As to the impact to the neighborhood. Our opponents speculate that property. Values will go down by enacting the proposed changes, but the documents we've already provided you. Disprove that assumption. Our opponents. Also claim that we are a small band of. Dissatisfied retirees with an ax to grind against certain architectural standards. Had they participated in the numerous public meetings and public discussions of this issue, or. Even if they were active in. Community life here in the neighborhood, they would know that the vast majority. Of the residents of low spirited support these changes. This is just a partial list of over the 400 people that signed petitions in favor of these types of curbs on mansion ization. The proposed changes are consistent with and not in opposition to the general plan. In fact, the r1l zoning area was created in 1980 in recognition of the unique character of the Low Streets area with its. Quote, open, uncrowded living environment. Indeed, the. Last time this. Council considered the mansion ization issue in 2007, when Belmont Shore and Belmont Heights. Were the poster. Child for Mansion Association, your standing directive to the Planning Department was to come up with additional rules to prevent mansion exemption as needed. Thank you. Thank you for your time. 3 minutes. The proposed changes do an admirable job of this and we support them. Please vote yes. Thank you so much. And just an employee. When we when the clapping happens, it actually cuts into the next speaker's comments. Next speaker, please. Members of the city council. My name is Richard Ivey. I represent the Las Vegas Neighborhood Association, which supports this effort by the city planning staff and the planning commissioners. That will most certainly help preserve the character and home values in this neighborhood. The Las Vegas Neighborhood Association represents. We request that the city council approve the r1l standards changes as proposed by the city planning staff and as approved by the Planning Commission. The proposed changes are the culmination of a two year effort that was begun by City Council action and enacted by the planning staff. The proposed changes are not the result of a knee jerk reaction, but a measured response to professionals who have addressed the issues. The planning staff took charge, investigated the standards, toured the neighborhood, held community outreach meetings, and independently formulated these standards that will help preserve. The character of our wonderful neighborhood. We appreciate the planning, staff's dedication, professionalism in bringing these recommendations before you. The any hopes that you will vote to enact these standards as proposed. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi. My name is Kevin Case. I live on Locust. I had a lot more to say, but I think it's mostly been said. But one thing that is interesting for me is, yes, I've lived in the neighborhood a long time, over 27 years. But four years ago I moved and when I did that, I didn't choose to go somewhere else like that. I'm not sure Naples or even Manhattan Beach stayed in the same neighborhood, moved three blocks away. And that was only because of the charm, the character of the neighbors. It's wide streets, old trees and open views. It's a wonderful. Place and we'd like to see it stay similar. Thanks. Thank you next week. And please. Good evening, Mayor and Council. My name is Larry Tidwell. I'm an architect and I've lived in this neighborhood for over 25 years. As other people have said, it's the character of the neighborhood we're trying to preserve here, that the wide open spaces, the large setbacks, the architectural character of many different styles of homes in the neighborhood that were built not by one developer, but by individual owners and architects over a span of many decades. So we have a great variety of eclectic style of homes, but they all they're all respective of each other and they're neighbors. So nobody's house looms over another house. And these changes to the zoning code clarify the character of the neighborhood better than the current zoning requirements do by reducing the floor area ratio and increasing the setbacks it makes. The written language of the code match the reality of almost all the homes in the neighborhood today. So by adopting these changes, we preserve what's there. We don't limit the character and the design and the architecture of homes, but just make sure that everybody can be respectful of each species, their neighbors and the whole community in which we all live. Thank you. Thank you. Next picture, please. Vice Mayor Richardson and Honorable City Councilmembers. My name is Jim McDaniel. I live on Cedar Avenue. I'd like to thank the staff of Councilman Al Austin and Councilman Austin himself, the planning commission, the the staff of the Planning Department and the residents of those three for all the work that has been put into this effort. I'm speaking tonight in support of the staff recommendation for changes to the R-1 L Zone Development and Design Standards. The proposed standards are designed to allow for a great variety of architectural styles that make our neighborhoods so special. They do not impose any sort of specific architectural style requirement on our neighborhood. This is not an attempt to Irvine ize our neighborhood. In fact, it will probably just do the opposite by restricting large slab sited structures that pervade much of Orange County in the San Gabriel Valley and encourage thoughtfully designed homes in scale with their neighbors . The proposed standards protect setbacks and traditional house massing to better preserve the character of the neighborhood. When large two storey walls are built with minimal setbacks, light and air are restricted from neighboring homes. These standards will help keep structures from impinging on the light and air space from of adjacent properties. The proposed standards will still allow houses of significant size as long as they are in scale with the lots in which they're being built. The planning staff has told us that the average house size and low cerritos is 2850 square feet, more or less, and that the largest home in the neighborhood is around 8400 square feet. Under the proposed standards, homes on our largest lots could be as large as 16,000 square feet, which is much larger than anything now existing and on a more typical large lot. You could still build homes of 6000 square feet, which is large compared to the neighborhood. The proposed standards will protect and improve our property values. Cities such as Arcadia, where marginalization was not addressed, have seen a drop in property values compared to neighboring communities such as Sierra madre, where sensible standards were implemented. This update to the development standards is urgently required now due to market forces. As property values across Southern California continue to rise. Speculators are looking at neighborhoods like ours to tear down older, smaller houses and build structures that maximize house size. Minimum costs, oftentimes on small lots. This is already happening in our neighborhood, and it's not adding to home values. In closing, I would like to commend the professionalism of the Planning Department staff. This has been a long effort and much patience has been required from all involved. We believe that the proposal that is before you this evening is a result of a compromise in the best tradition of that word that addresses all the interests that were brought forward. Some of the neighbors may not have gotten all they wanted. Others may feel this goes too far. But this is a solid proposal that was carefully crafted and considered by the staff and large numbers of neighbors dedicated over the last 24 months. And it deserves your support. Thank you. Thank you so much for your time. So seeing no further public comment, we're going to close the hearing and take it back behind the rail. Councilman Austin. Thank you. And I want to thank all of the residents who took time out to come out and give testimony this evening on this hearing, as well as those of you who have met with me in my office and the coffee over coffee and throughout the neighborhood. I've received a number of input from residents over the past several months. In the spring of 2015, I was approached by a group of residents from the Lower Cerritos neighborhood who had concerns about some of the new homes that were being built. And they wanted to revise the development standards for their neighborhood. They had done some research and collect the signatures from many neighbors. Rosarito, north of Bixby Road, is the only neighborhood in the city that has our one el zone designated for large lots. I was willing to entertain the discussion and in July of 2015, the City Council approved a motion to start the process to put a moratorium in place. The request, the planning staff and the Planning Commission to review the issue, meet with the community and make recommendations to the City Council. More than a year and a half later, we're here tonight. I must say upfront that the planning staff has done an excellent job on this and has put far more time than I originally expected it would take. I would especially like to thank Linda Tatum, Karie Tai and Mark Underwood for their Hungerford, for their efforts. They had several meetings with the groups of registered residents, both for and against the changes. They held two community meetings where all 647 homeowners were invited. They brought in a consultant to help facilitate the Community Meetings. Plan Commission conducted a public study session on the issue last December and held hearings last month to vote on. Commendations. And so more after more than a year and a half with plenty of public input input as staff work on this issue. We're here tonight. However, I still believe that there are two outstanding issues. And number one. Is there consensus among the homeowners in the neighborhood for these changes? The number two, is there a need for these changes? On the first question, it appears that there is not. Obviously, from the public comment here, there are people on both sides of this. I received a number of email correspondences and they are both for and against. And so I don't think there's consensus on this issue. As the process has moved along, I've spoken with more residents who have concerns about what is being proposed. Some who said that they've signed a position, they signed a petition at the beginning and now they don't agree with what's being proposed. I personally am uncomfortable with fully embracing the changes to neighborhood zones requirements that is not fully embraced by the neighborhood itself. On the second question, is there a real need for changes? I'm not yet convinced of this either. According to planning staff of the 25 largest homes in a neighborhood, a lots of up to 15,000 square feet. Only one was built since 1990. Of the 25 largest homes, a loss of more than 15,000 square feet. Only two were built since the year 2000, and there have been only three permits issued in the past ten years for the construction of new homes, and only 12 have been issued permits for additions of more than 1000 square feet in the last ten years . We are not seeing a major transformation of the neighborhood that is being experienced in some cities that have adopted mass immunization ordinances. I know that there's one home in the neighborhood that's been a focus of much of the drive against marginalization. There's some incremental and I believe that there are some incremental steps that we can take to not have similar homes built in the little Cerritos neighborhood. From the beginning, I've heard far more consensus against a lot mergers, and I support the Planning Commission's recommendations proposing a restriction to no lot more mergers of more than two lots or exceeding a total of 20,000 square feet. I also believe that increasing the front yard set back from 20 feet to 25 feet is consistent with what is already exist in the neighborhood. And so I don't have a problem with that. Finally, the Planning Commission recommended some additional design standards for new proposed large homes, which I believe there's a general support for. The other proposed new restrictions on saleyards, set backs and reducing floor area ratios or if they are, would make some current homes in a neighborhood that many consider to be quality homes out of compliance with the new standards. There are approximately 18 homes that currently exist, all of which were built prior to 1985. That would become non-conforming by just reducing the FHA from 6.602.50. And there are many more long standing homes that will become non-conforming because of the proposed site setbacks. Under the proposed standards. I know many of the homeowners have concerns about the proposed changes, and I believe that the incremental approach is the most prudent approach at this time, and it may not completely satisfy everyone. But again, I don't see a neighborhood. I don't like to see a neighborhood divided against itself, which this discussion has done, unfortunately. The city is currently going through an update of our land use element and after that we'll be revising our entire zoning ordinance. And if we find a problem that arises in the next few years, I don't currently see which I don't currently see, there will be another opportunity to address the zoning standards at that time and much of the legwork. Fortunately has already been done. I do appreciate the input of the many residents and the work of the Planning Commission staff and the Planning Commission itself during this process. Therefore, I'd like to make a motion. To receive the supporting documentation into the record, conclude the public hearing and accept category categorical exemption number. See $16 340. Hold on. And to clear the ordinance amending Table three 31.2 A of the Long Beach Municipal Code Residential Development Standards amended to establish a 25 foot minimum front yard setback and amend Table 31 to a in the notes section of the table to indicate that lots created three land subdivision or lot merger shall not exceed 20,000 square feet and the lot merger shall not be comprised of more than two lots and omitted that amend section 21.30 1.255 of the Municipal Cook Code Municipal Code relating to the design treatment and finish to add subsections f one through four as set forth in the draft ordinance submitted to the Council for its consideration tonight, read for the first time and laid over to the next regular meeting of the City Council for Final Reading. And that is my motion. Thank you. Councilman Austin, city attorney. Did you get that, Mr. Mays? You get that. Okay, Councilman, you ringa. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I just want to commend everybody involved, staff council member Austin and people in the public for their engagement in this in this effort. It's been a long time coming. And I think that the plan, as it is currently adopted or proposed to be adopted is a is the end of all the discussions that have been taking place. And I'm glad to see that there has been some agreement, mostly agreement on the on the proposed plans, I think, in this. Thank you. Councilman. Councilman. Mongo. So I at the very end, I know there was a little bit of a change of what I had read before. So you're taking out two items. The Lots. No, we tell that little end part, but it was really long in the very. Way I am proposing or my motion is to accept everything proposed or recommended by the Planning Commission except the side lot. So back setbacks as well as the floor area ratio recommendations, but everything else. So then the status quo on those two items would remain in effect, right? Okay. So the fifth District has had a lot of discussion around double lots and things like that as well. And so I just wanted to offer a point of clarification to the city manager. It sounds as though that the decision being made tonight is only on. Well, first, I should start with how many districts in the city fall under this zone? How many groups besides these 400 homes? There are no other districts in the city that have the same standards that are in this particular neighborhood, the r1l zone. This area, geographically, is the only location in the city that has this particular zoning. And are there any plans for any other areas to have this kind of zoning? No, I think this goes to a bit about what some of our residents were saying tonight about the misinformation that's out in the community. In the fifth district, we have double lots, but they are not r1l zones. And so the the comments and dialogs that I had actually when I bumped into someone at the grocery store today and the coffee shop and the UPS store were a little bit confused because I think that people believe that anything that happens in one part of the city is for the whole city. And I think that it's really important for people to know that each part of our city is very different. The city of Long Beach is as big as I mean, some cities in L.A. County are one 1/40 of the size of the city of Long Beach. So this is not a process for anything other than the 400 homes in this particular area. And then I just wanted to ask one additional follow up question. Should there be a time where a resident wants an exception to what we passed tonight? What would that process look like? There is a process in the zoning code called a variance procedure. However, it is very limited to a very unique situation, such as an irregular lot size or a lot size that has or a lot that has an unusual slope. Some other shape issue or geographical issue, but not just convenience. It's intended to be very unique and limited in its application. So if someone wanted an exception that lived in that area and they thought that it was worthy of consideration, would they be able to bring it to or would their council member or another councilmember be able to bring it to this board and get five votes and change that? Or would they need to change it. For the whole area? I would have to say it would really depend upon the circumstance in the situation because for one unique lot, it likely may not warrant a change to the code, but that is the kind of thing that staff would look at and examine. And if we felt that a change to the code was warranted, it would likely go forward as a recommended code change rather than just an action on an individual property. And that is very unique. And to your knowledge, we have not been doing that here in the city of Long Beach. That is correct. Wonderful. And that's all my questions. And I'll be supporting the motion. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Austin. Thank you. I just like to, before we vote, just state how a little Cerritos Virginia Country Club neighborhood is one of the, I think, best in the city whether or not we approve this tonight. It is still one of the more desirable areas in the city to live in. It is an awesome community. My, my, my emotion was the spirit of the motion was to seek to get consensus and an a strike, a medium medium with the the community and the residents, because there is a lot of division on this issue in terms of property rights and existing homes that are there, amazing homes that, again , if they were built today, would not fall into what is being proposed. What was proposed by the Planning Commission. And so understand whether or not you agree with the decision or not or the motion or not. Please understand that we put a lot of thought into this and we really looking to find a balance and something that that does preserve the quality and integrity and character of the Los Cerritos neighborhood. Members. Thank you, Councilman Austin. So and I'll just share that. This is a really beautiful neighborhood. This is a really nice neighborhood. I see why it's got so much interest in it. I think Councilman Alston has done a good job, will do with paid attention to the way folks have been engaged. Staff has done a great job on this. Sometimes, you know, when these things happen, you have you know, when issues come up, you try your best to build as much consensus as possible. And I like the approach of, you know, the things that have consensus and moving forward. It makes it a lot easier for me to support Councilman Alston with his motion. So I urge and I vote. Councilman Andrews Yes, and I also want to commend Councilman awesomeness motion here because the fact that I think when I retire I'm just thinking about moving that way. So. Thank you. No further comment. Members, please cast your vote. That's.","Recommendation to declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code by amending Table 31-2A, residential development standards, and by adding Section 21.31.255.F, relating to development and design standards applicable to properties in the R-1-L zoning district, read and adopted as read.

The first item we'll take up is amendment number one to Council Bill 118361. This adds a small business technical assistance project to the annual action plan. It provides $210,000 in community development block grant funding and then reduces the microenterprise lending project by $210,000, leaving a total of $165,000 that will be utilized for the technical assistance program. And I would move amendment number one. Second. It's moved in. Second, and any questions? Councilmember Harrell. I just want to make a point that I made this morning. I'm supporting the bill. But again, that discussion we had this morning about small businesses and in particular immigrant refugee businesses or minority owned businesses, that part of what we're doing, we are recognizing that there's a need for technical assistance. I continue to believe that lending and access to capital will be a huge charge of ours. So I would want us to look at latter part of this year during the budget process and next year, whether it's access to capital, which seems which should probably drive a lot of our decision making. That continues to be a concern. We hear it over and over. I'm sure there's a need for technical assistance as well, but I think we need to really put a little pressure on the department to to better understand what's happening out there at these small businesses and what, in fact, their needs are. Since we did identify a need, one of the issues was that we didn't get enough money out of the door. Let's find out what's happening there. But certainly I support this legislation. Thank you. Any other comments? All in favor of amendment number one vote. I oppose vote no. Amendment number one is approved. Amendment number two replaces current language regarding additional researchers resources on page 16 of the proposed annual action plan.

After reasoning logically, produce a structured, concise, and formal legislative summary that strictly follows the formal legislative language and formatting as illustrated below.",5,"The bill passed and Cheryl sign it. Please read the first agenda item and if the Governance, Equity and Technology Committee section. To be part of the Governance Equity and Technology Committee and item one cancel 119 254 relating to the ethics code, the many sections for point 16.0 38.0 77 is for code requiring elected officials to disclose financial interests in legislative matters prior to participating in those matters and creating a limited exception to the requirement that elected officials disqualify themselves from participating. Such matters committee recommends the bill passed as amended. Okay, thank you very much. So this legislation was initiated by the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission after our city council structure moved to a At-Large and district structure and currently under the ethics code. If a council member, of course shares a financial interest with a substantial segment of the city population, he or she does not need to disclose or recuse. But if that financial interest is not shared, he or she must recuse himself or herself from participate participate in voting. And with these changes presented by this new bill, basically there's a disclosure process if in fact there's a financial interest shared with a substantial segment of the population. And that sort of terminology becomes sort of critical, to be very candid, if a council member still has a direct financial interest in matters that are being legislated or discussed, of course he or she still has a conflict and there's a different mechanism that is recusal. But in a situation where there is a it is shared with a substantial segment of the population, there is a sort of disclosure process that I will describe in a minute. There will be a slight amendment from Councilmember Herbold, 12 counts for her. I go through the base legislation and will reserve some time for that. In addition, this new bill also applies to all elected officials, which now would include the mayor and the city attorney, whereas the previous ordinance just applied to council members. So what are those disclosures? If, in fact an elected official holds a financial interest with a substantial segment of the of the public? Hiroshima's post a written disclosure on the officials web page and file a copy. The Executive Director and the City Clerk. The Council member must additionally make a disclosure on public record at an open public meeting of the Council or one of the committees at which the Legislature led legislative matters discussed. The Council members shall also, before participating in that legislative matter at any subsequent Council Committee meetings, repeat the oral disclosure on the public record of that meeting . We've actually started discussing this some time ago, back in 2016, in 2017. And so we try to work with the commission sort of to better understand both the the basis, the legal and factual basis for this legislation and make sure we weren't sort of overlooking any practical concerns. So I want to thank the commissioners all for unanimously recommending this this legislation. And again, we want to air on the side of complete transparency. So that means repeated disclosures, making sure, again, a person since we were by district can have, if affected, can have district representation in critical legislative matters and still again weighing the need for transparency with having representation in a particular district. I'll tell you what, there might be a question to someone may say, but at this point, I'm going to suspend the rules to allow councilman or herbal to present a an amendment, which I don't think is controversial. And then we could have some discussion about the base amendment to have to make a formal motion. And can I just exercise my authority? Okay. By unanimous consent hopefully of for no one stands up and hollers by unanimous unanimous consent and no objection. We're going to suspend the rules now and allow Councilor Herbold to present an amendment which I was chastised for doing things that the ladies are. And let's see if we're going to chastise her as the way you did me. The way the record did, that I. Assume you have the floor it. Is owed me and I will take it. Thank you. Thank you, Council President, for allowing me to speak to this proposed amendment to the the rest of the amendments that are before the Council. This is, I think, neither strict in conflict with what has come out of committee, nor is it prescriptive to to the commission. One of the elements coming out of the legislation voted by the committee before us now is to ask that the Ethics and Election Commission develop a rule. And the rule relates specifically to what a substantial segment of the public is. And my amendment only app asks the Commission to consider whether or not the rule should. Include a distinction of whether or not the elected official is elected by district or citywide. It doesn't require them to make a distinction. It just ask them to consider whether or not there should be a distinction. Thank you for that amendment. I certainly support it. Is there a second? It's like. Okay, this is just for the amendment that for the base legislation. Any other questions about Councilman Herbold amendment? And thank you for bringing that concern back show. Thank you. So, first of all, I just want to say. I know we are trying very hard to get these things in early. I think. Getting this at 215 on the same day that we're supposed to be voting on, it doesn't. Qualify as especially when we've been working on it for about four years now. But that said, considering that you. And Councilmember Gonzalez both live in District one as an example, hypothetically speaking. How would you think the. Rule would apply and impact the two of you. Differently? What are you looking for? The rule hasn't been developed. I'm simply asking the Commission in its development of the rule to consider whether or not there should be a difference. I don't know the answer to that question. I'm just asking. They are the experts and they are they're going to be the ones who are developing the rule. I'm just flagging this as as an issue for them to consider in their rule development. Okay. And I'll just say that nothing in the amendment that Councilmember Herbold is advancing or the underlying legislation would actually resolve. The conflict of interest that I've. Identified in terms of my direct or your soundtrack's. Financial interests with regard to the sound transit. Preferred. Preferred alternative identified by the Stakeholder. Advisory Group. Which is right on top of my condo. So these rules are going to I'm still going to be completely conflicted out and will not see any really through. So there is no impact for me as an elected official making decisions in that other space. Great. Thank you. And I just want to underscore, I was not thinking specifically of that incident. I was just thinking that both of you are in district one. And how would this be impactful for the two of you just going forward and let's just say your condo issue is off. Is is not an issue. I mean, I'm I'm I'm at large representative. So I think the formula and calculation of the conflict would have to be evaluated through that at large months of substantially substantial number of people across the city would have to be benefiting it. I just happen to live in District one. Okay. So we're just going to vote on the amendment. Any other questions on just the amendment? All those in favor of Councilmember Herbold amendment s8+. Please vote i. I opposed. Okay, so the base legislation is amended. Would any councilmembers like to comment on the base legislation before we take a vote? Sure. I'll just be. Thank you. I want to say thanks to my colleagues. We have actually been working on this since 2013. I think the first time I am here appeared in front of the Ethics Commission was the summer of 2013. I believe. Now, Councilmember Gonzales was on the commission at that time and very much appreciate the fact that we've been. Going through this with. Great care. Wayne Barnett's here. Appreciate how hard that that office has been working for me. It's really about. Being able to. Represent the constituents in District seven. Initially, when I was told I could not be involved, I've had to recuse myself. As all of you know. This waterfront project is something I've been working on since. 2004 in different. Capacities, and I look forward to being able to come back and meet with my constituents here again, their concerns and make decisions with the rest of you. So thank you today for. All of your work on it. Council President Hiro leading the group and the government subcommittee and I appreciate going forward today. Very good. Councilmember O'Brien. Thank you. I'm going to be voting against this today, but I want to just speak briefly. Why? I also want to state my appreciation for the work that's been done in the last few weeks to really narrowly tailor this. And I think that makes this much harder decision for me. I understand the desire of the commission to be able to focus on this unique circumstances we now have because we have district council members. And I think that that's a valid concern that is being weighed against what I think is our existing ethics in elections code, which is, I believe, one of the best in the country. And for me, that tradeoff is just not quite enough to support this right now. I understand why. And I think that reasonable minds I certainly understand why folks would support it. But for me, my preference would be to leave things as they are. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Bryant. Any other comments or concerns? Councilwoman Johnson. Just briefly, I want to say that in contrast to Councilmember O'Brien actually will be voting yesterday. I was opposed to the approach as it was originally proposed in 2016 when I first started on the council. That was because I thought that it was written a little too broadly in the instance of potential future conflicts. I live just outside a urban village in Roosevelt Ravine, a neighborhood. The way that that legislation was described to me in 2016 would have been that I would have still been allowed to vote on council matters that could potentially rezone my own property that seemed like too big of a conflict of interest. And in this instance, I would now still be prohibited from voting on the rezoning of my property, which I think many folks would perceive as an accurate conflict of interest, that I, as a councilmember, shouldn't be able to vote on changes to my own property values based on that particular conflict. So this is more this more narrowly tailored approach is one that I can support, and we'll be voting yes today. Thank you very much. Okay. I think we're cancer. I'm a skater. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the amendments that have been put forward. Thank you to Wayne and your team for trying to find a path forward. I, too, was concerned with some of the initial language that I saw. Obviously, I think that we believe that any elected should not be lining their own pockets with any policy decision that's made and that there should not be a direct financial benefit for votes that are taken. I think a great example is the one that was just mentioned. If a rezoning decision were in front of us and that related to anybody's specific property and there was direct financial benefits, that would be a conflict that I would want to make sure somebody had had the requirement to recuse themselves. Under this scenario, it appears that that is the case, and we have crafted this carefully. I think that it's important that we allow for folks to vote on policies that allow for us to act as good stewards of the public dollar and make good public policy decisions. For example, I want everybody on this council to be able to make decisions about how we create new sidewalks for people to walk carefully to school or to work. I want to be able to have this entire council be able to vote on up zones so that we can create more density and the opportunity to live in this city. Those are two examples of ways that we improve the quality of life for all Seattle and don't have a direct benefit to any one individual, though it may be a direct benefit to a region or certain portion of Seattle. It's not a direct financial lining of anybody's pocket. So I think that this is a good compromise. Thank you to Wayne again and your team and to the council members that have put this forward. I'll be supporting this version. Thank you, councilmember skater. Okay, I think we're ready to vote, so let's do that. Oh, I'm sorry, Councilmember Swatch. Thank you. Rosen Herald. I respect Councilmember O'Brien's concerns, but I think if there is full disclosure, then that is the important thing and I think that remains existing here. I will be voting yes on it. I also wanted to just note that ultimately the biggest financial impact on council members and our politicians in general is the campaign donations they get from big business, which is still going to be allowed. So I think that that's the essential point. So thank you. Thank you. Yes. Matt Herbold. Thank you. I just wanted to take a moment to speak to the base Bill, if I could. When we originally started deliberating on this piece of legislation, I turned to the Ethics and Elections website where it says that the code seeks to prevent conflicts of interest. In other words, the objective is not to make conflicts known to the public, but instead is to try to ensure that they don't occur at all. A financial interest in itself is not a conflict of interest. And that's why by asking the Ethics and Elections Commission to, through its rulemaking process, determine what a substantial segment of the public is, we are still maintaining that bright line in prohibiting conflicts of interests, because we are we are giving them the ability to to determine when a financial interest is held by primarily the council member or a small number of folks, and whether or not that really meets that that standard. So given the pivoting of this legislation, more again towards the the the the bright line that we've had for a very long time and has benefited us in the city, I am going to support the legislation. Thank you, Councilman Herbold. Okay. I believe we are now ready. Councilmember, anyone change your mind? Could do a nine. And over here I got nine and I'll kick in here for you. Okay. Keep it interesting. Okay. Please call the roll on the passage of the amended bill. So on I make sure. By Gonzales. I Herbold II. Johnson Suarez. Mr. O'Brien. No. President Herrell. All right.

The resolution also requests that the executive review and make recommendations regarding the action items indicated at each of those six priority areas.

The Office of Planning Community Development Review. And make recommendations as identified by the community. In the Action Plan in the 2035 comp plan for consideration in 2020. I have a very.

It's maintaining the current. Got it. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Thank you. Counts member. All right. Madam Secretary, if you please put the next item on our screens, which is Resolution 99. And Councilwoman CdeBaca, this is yours as well. Go ahead with your questions. Thank you, Mr. Morel. Here. It's. Good evening. Members of Council Greg Moreau, director of Community Corrections. Thank you so much. Wanted to make sure that we get on record the timeline for the RFP that should be coming that should be should have accompanied the vote, but will be bumped out a little bit. Can you tell us about when the door for new providers in the community correction space is going to be open? Yes, Councilwoman. So we are currently working with. Purchasing and hope to have a procured procurement issued. In early March. Awesome. And are we? So with this extension of the contract and the future opening of the door for new providers. What what will allow us to determine when we end our services with core civic. If we don't need to go all the way to to the date that this extends it to. So what this extension. Does is give us the time to operate and sustain the current model. If through the procurement process, new providers are identified, as soon as they can step into that space, we can start to evaluate the need for beds at course. Of moving forward. And can you again on the record explain the ratchet down of beds that will happen before this contract ends? If I understand the question correctly so, the current. Average daily population is roughly 330 individuals. That number will extend through October 1st if this amendment is approved and then the cap will be at 250. Through June of 21. At some point on the back end of the contract will continue to ratchet down because you can't just get from 250 to 0 overnight. Awesome. Thank you. All right, Councilmember Ortega. Don't leave. So I just want to clarify a couple of things. So we've already purchased Tully Hall. And I just want to. Just in my mind, be clear about the process that Councilwoman CdeBaca asked about if that has anything to do with Tori Hall or if that is specific to the facilities that Core Civic is currently in by extending their contracts to remain there through the end of next year. So Councilwoman Ortega, the in the procurement process will seek to. Identify a new provider or providers of services for the newly hot site. In addition, we'll be looking for providers to submit proposals that would say we can. Offer these services at this location. So I think the locations of those new proposals are we don't know yet. We need to wait until those proposals come in. So the assumption is they'll come. Their proposals will include their own locations. No, not not these current properties that core civic is in. So their locations could include their own properties. You know, per the letter that was attached to this request. Of course, Civic has agreed to work with the city and give the city. You know, the first right to to negotiate for the lease or sale of their properties. But tonight's bill only deals with the operations, not any acquisition whatsoever. That is properties. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember Kenny. Thank you. I actually just wanted to say thank you. During committee, we asked for some assurances that we'd have a chance to discuss the buildings should that opportunity arise and making sure they weren't going to be sold. And you provided such a letter and the company signed that letter as well. And so I just want to thank you for for providing that reassurance. And I'm going to be comfortable moving this forward tonight because I believe it's critical. I'll refer to my comments in committee about the critical nature of continuing to allow placements to continue and not losing important space. And we keep saying beds, it's really people. So to not lose people who may have to spend more time incarcerated before or may be released without supervision. Right. That's what community corrections is. It's extra supervision and support. So whether you care about the person, whether you care about the community, in both cases, I think there's some benefits to being able to continue this capacity without interruption. So I'll be very happy to see this go forward tonight. Thanks. Thank you. Councilmember Councilmember Hines. Thank you, Mr. President. So I'm not in the committee that is actively working on this. I'm not on safety either, the committee that this went through. So I apologize for my ignorance. You mentioned 250 beds by 2021. Our goal is not to exit completely by 2020 or June of 2021. Our goal is not to exit completely by June of 2021. So Councilman, if I can clarify. So the 250 is the number of placements or individuals that we would have downsized from 330. By October 1st. Through the rest of that period, which would end June 2021. Our goal would be to reach zero. Okay. Thank you. And I would echo Councilman, can you just point about these are people and we want to make sure that we protect people in our community. And so thank you for that clarification. I was concerned there for a minute, but I just misunderstood. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilmember Councilmember said, can you back up? Yes, thank you. Just a request for our team. I don't think that the letter has been uploaded into the public facing system. And so if we could get that in there, I think it is very important to the public to have access to that.","A resolution approving an Amendatory Agreement between the City and County of Denver to be administered by the Department of Safety, Division of Community Corrections in consultation with the Denver Community Corrections Board and Corecivic, Inc. for residential and non-residential community corrections services.

Recommendation to resume final report at the at the April 15, 2014 Council meeting for the next steps on the rebuild of Basins two and three. An Albino Spey Marina. Mr. Long. Let's hear the report. Okay. Mr. West. By vice mayor councilmembers. About 30 days ago, Councilmember DeLong and Councilmember Lowenthal brought forward this item to talk about how we can speed up the elevated Alamitos Bay Marina rebuild. We are running out of money looking for some bond issues and things like that. So the council directed us to go back, sharpen our pencils and come back. We're doing that tonight. I do want to make a comment that through the efforts of Councilmember O'Donnell, it does help to have an oral history here. He was working as a city employee back in the early nineties, late eighties, and recalled that while the Titans fund wasn't doing so well back then, a certain amount of marina funds went to the Tidelands area that wasn't repaid. So we looked at that. The council directed us to look at that. And sure enough, we found about $10.9 million from back in the early nineties that went to Tidelands because again, Tidelands was broke at that time and wasn't repaid. So with that direction of the council, we're looking at that $10.9 million to help jumpstart this project. And I want to turn this over to our Parks Recreation and Marine Director George Champion to walk us through the time schedule and where we're at. Thank you, Mr. West. Thank you, council members. We are going to wait for the PowerPoint to appear on the screen. So just a slight technical difficulty. Vice mayor, vice mayor and members of the city council. So with this presentation tonight, I'll talk about the history of the rebuild in Long Beach marinas, all three of them, the completed phases of the Alamitos Bay. Rebuild the remaining phases of the Army's Bay rebuild. And recommendations on moving forward with the remaining phases, including funding options, which I will turn over to Director of Financial Management John GROSS when I'm finished with my presentation. As you know, Long Beach has three marinas Shoreline, Rainbow and Alamitos, built in the 1950s and sixties. Those three marinas have a combined slip count of 3677 with 2095 of those slips in Alamitos Bay. The marinas were built in the 1950s and sixties, so they have either exceeded their useful lifespan or very near the end of their lifespan. Back in 1995, the City Council authorized state loans, state loan applications for the revitalization of the city's marinas. However, due to state budget shortfalls over the years, only portions were approved by the state. The state approved $32 million for Shoreline and 34.1 million for them. East Bay Marina, Shoreline and Rainbow marinas were built with concrete docks by Shore Master LLC, who, by the way, also bid on the Alamitos Bay Rebuild Project, but was was not the lowest bidder. The rebuild started in 2005 and was completed in 2007. The total cost was $37 million for the Shoreline and rainbow marinas. At that time, however, construction at shoreline included only docks using existing piles, pilings wherever. Whereas Alamitos Bay has a broader scope, including dredging, pile removal, installation, seawall repair, etc. etc. Again, Shoreline Marina was just docks. It's an important distinction when comparing shoreline to the Animas Bay rebuild. To look at the history of the rebuild for the Army's big project. We pulled all the council reports dating back to December 25. There were some there were some reports prior to that. But I think for our purposes, 2005 was sufficient. Since 2005, 12. Parks. Recreation and Marine Action items have come before the City Council regarding the Alamitos Bay rebuild. Of those 12, ten were very specific about the project needing to be phased due to lack of funding for the entire rebuild project. Looking at the history of the ABM rebuild, it was clear from the beginning that the city didn't have enough money to do the entire rebuild at one time. It was recognized early on that that this rebuild, if it was to be done, would be built in phases or on a pay as you go basis, if you will . This was again emphasized by the city auditor in a public presentation before the City Council on August I'm sorry, April 212, 2011, recognizing that this project had to be phased. The Parks Recreation Marine Department has worked with financial management in every phase of this rebuild to assess the financial condition of the bureau, the state loans and the viability of the next steps to today. Four of the eight basins have been completed since 2002, with most of the work being completed more recently. As you can see from this, these are the four basins that were completed Basin eight, basin four, basin one and Basin five as of April 14, as of April 2014. These are the basins that have been completed. Sure. Again, was strictly replacement of docs and nothing more. No piles were replaced, no dredging done. Just replacement of docs. Allow me to say by comparison was much greater in scope and much more complex. It included new piles, gangways docks, seawall repair, void, grouting under seawalls, new utilities and disposal of disposable silt. Work in basin for also included landside improvements such as ADA compliant restrooms, landscaping and parking lot. So given the additional cost for the landside work base and for we made a decision at that time that we would not do any more landside work in the immediate future so that we can concentrate our dollars towards completing the docks for the remaining basins we'd say the landside work for after all, the waterside was completed. The audit scope, the scope of the work for for the elements to be rebuilt was extensive compared to Shoreline, but the scope was even further expanded by requirements imposed on the project by the Coastal Commission when the city submitted the project for their approval. Coastal added these additional requirements to the project. These were not part of the original cost estimates for the project. So back in 2008, when gave the cost estimates. These were considered as part of the cost estimates. The scope of, as you can see, includes eelgrass mitigation, insulet, pump outs, biological monitoring, drive, boat storage. Again this is coastal is attempt to keep boating affordable for people because of the changes in the boating industry. More and more people are moving away from the small boats, so Coastal wants to make sure those are available. Drive boat storage is available for the smaller boats, recycling away stations, post displacement allowances. Again, these were unique to the army as they rebuild, not so much to the shoreline rebuild. The funding sources for the four basins that were completed, as you can see. State loans, a combination of state loans and marina fund for a total of $48 million. So we have the remaining phases for the elements. Bay Rebuild our base in two base, in three base and six in base and seven with the number of slips in those basins. In addition, Coastal does require us to build a dry boat storage for the small boats. As we indicated, the cost by category Bellingham Marine Industries, that's $52 million for the docks. These prices right now are, as of today, assuming there are no other delays. The projects for all four basins and the dry boat storage would come in at $60 million. Contingency is about 5% of Bemis cost. The water quality monitoring during dredging has to be done by federal requirements. The construction management the city uses trans systems is our construction manager. This contract with Trans Systems was approved by the City Council back in 2005th December 2005, and their scope of services were pre-construction, construction and post-construction work. This number represents construction services such as coordination of all project participants, developing construction schedules, monitoring the design and construction process to ensure completion within scope and stormwater permitting. Our recommendation for the priority of the remaining basins would be as follows Basin to basin three, six, seven and the dry boat storage. If we were to do all this work at one time, the first order of business would be to complete the Southern California Edison and Utility Backbone four Basin two and three. And this item will be next on tonight's agenda for your approval if you wish to approve that project. Dock word and dock work and dredging needs to be done in Basin two and that's critical at low tide clears in some areas is only three feet an industry standard for size for the size vessels in that basin is eight feet at minimum. And again, dry boat storage requirements. And that's a California coastal requirement. Dredging. We do have a ocean disposal permit that allows us to dispose of the dredged material up to October 2015. After that date, the city will work with the Port of Long Beach towards disposal solutions in the Middle Harbor Phase three project . That concludes my presentation. I'll turn this over to John GROSS to go over the financials. Thank you. And I'm going to cover how we might finance this and how we can finance it. What I'll be talking about is based on work by some expert consultants that finance and the Parks and Recreation Marine Department hired to review the financial status of the Marina Fund and to assess the competitive situation for our slip fees . Based on that review, a projection was done by the consultants of the amount of money that could be borrowed from the Marina Fund. And what I'll be representing tonight is based on that report. Slip fee increases are very important because most of the revenue from the Marina Fund, which pays for the rebuild, that's where the money comes from. Slip fee rate increases dictate how much money is going to be available for the ABM rebuild and how much we can borrow. The options we looked at and our consultants looked at include included going an ongoing 2% slip fee increases combined with various types of other increases, including 3% increases until market levels are reached. And that was looked at because the current slip fee rates are somewhat below the market in this area. However, regardless of the slip fee rates that we use, the marina does not have the ability to support enough debt to finance the remaining ABM. Rebuild costs that we just heard were about $60 million. So let's talk about the borrowing capacity of the marina. The consultants indicated that about 34 to $40 million can likely be borrowed by way of a bond issue, depending on the level of slip fee rate increases. That leaves about 20 to $26 million. That must come from other sources, potentially in phases in order to achieve the current $60 million cost of the remaining waterside parts of the project. The bonds will also take about a year to issue because of the complexities of the financing and the fact that this is a very difficult market in which to sell these bonds. There is a possible role of the Tidelands Fund in solving this funding situation. Tidelands has received about $10.9 million from the marina over a number of years, primarily between 88 and 96. That could be returned. That 10.9 million could be returned to the marina to help solve the funding problem. And as another point, it will take about 2 to 3 months to secure approval from the State Lands Commission, which were required to do for use of tidelands money for the ABM rebuild, if that's what council wishes to do. Overall, and just to wrap things up in terms of the timing and what can be done tonight, we have a request. The next item on the agenda from Parks, Recreation and Marine is to authorize $1.8 million from the Marina Fund, and it has that cash to continue ABM rebuild work. Staff will start immediately a process to engage consultants for a potential bond issue in June or July. This in just a couple of months from now, we expect to be able to secure State Lands Commission approval for use of tidelands funds at that time. $10.9 million of council wishes can be made available from Tidelands for an APM rebuild in addition and work on Basin two can begin with that $10.9 million. Work will then continue on the bond issue and in the first half of 2015, Council could consider authorizing bonds, the slip fee rates and the balance of funding for the project . Bonds could be sold based on those authorizations probably somewhere in April or May of 2015. And then the ABM rebuild could be continued and completed, and that is the end of staff's report. Okay. Thank you. I'm going to move on to council comments. Councilman DeLong. Thank you. You see a couple of things. First of all, you talk about in the existing work that's been done, about $15.8 million has come out of the marina funds to date. Did we receive state lands approval for each of those expenditures? I don't believe so. Those are marine enterprise funds. So they weren't Thailand's per se, but they were marina enterprise funds either. And I apologize. But, you know, sometimes we're told that it's all part of the Thailand fund and other times we're not. So we get conflicting information. Now, if you go with the theory that you've suggested here, that there $10.9 million is really marina funds. It's not Thailand's funds, but it's paid back. Why would you need state lands approval for it? Councilmember The distinction is in part the revenue source where the money comes from. So the marina funds are basically generated out of the marina. Yes. And so the oil revenue is what state lands requires approval of. So whenever we're using oil revenue for any capital project over $100,000, we need state lands approval. But I guess what I heard was that the $10.9 million was originally marina funds. And now all we're doing is we're reimbursing the Marina Fund. Right. But we're reimbursing it with oil revenue. That is for a specific capital project. So we will need state lands and as we've. Indicated, it. Will occur in June. And and I, I don't think we want to put in jeopardy all of the other capital projects that we have in the pipeline by trying to avoid State Lands Commission, because they pay very close attention to what we're doing with the oil revenue. Got it. All right. Help me understand the dredging a little better that we've talked about, that after October 2015 will work at the Port of Long Beach. And I'm sure that port will be as cropped as they can. But what what are the potential pitfalls with that approach? Is it a done deal or are there things that could happen that would prevent that from occurring? Councilmember We've already discussed this with the port and they have told us they've always worked with us, with our dredge material and they told us they'll be there for us at that period of time. No one can promise what's going to be happening at that period of time with measure with them, with their Middle Harbor project. But if they have the ability to take the dredge material, they certainly will. They've started. They've stated. Okay. And the $60 million total cost, how much of that is I guess, and what's the sequence? So we know you're recommending moving forward to face up to another 60 million. How much is associated basin to Councilmember Basin? Two is about $26.9 million. Okay. Got up since yesterday. How about it? And then this Basin three follow that. I don't think it went up since yesterday. It was always 26.9. Basin three is 22.1 million. And then on those costs, I'm sorry. You include all the costs, not just bellingham's. Right. Okay. City manager and I had a conversation yesterday based on sex, and that would be the next one that you would go to. Yes. Okay. And with the cost of. That would be 6.7 million. And based on seven. 1.6 million. And the drydock. That's $572,000. And the landside improvements after all this is done. Well, landside improvements would be a number of restrooms depending on when we do it. And escalation right now, I think, between landscaping and restrooms is about $18 million kind of. All right. If I see a city auditor here missed out every moment. How are you coming? Taking a look at the marina funds versus Thailand, the funds and how they've been used. We're still working on it. We have received all the documents from city staff and we're analyzing all the information. We should be wrapping it up in a couple of weeks and give it back to city management. Great. Okay. Because that could help the bond issues as well as more more funds in the Marina Fund. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you. That's all the questions I have at the moment. Councilman O'Donnell. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. And I want to say. Just quickly, I appreciate staff's work on this, because basins two and three are definitely in need of work. And I think that's why some of the individuals are down here tonight. They well know as users of the marina that those spaces are absolutely in need. There's planks popping up. There is nails sticking up. It's not really a safe place to walk. And I know staff is doing their best to address those conditions, but ultimately it has to be replaced. So at that, just a couple of questions with the plan. These are just practical questions. But the the plan, we're not going to losing existing public dock space. What I mean is the temporary space when people pull up, etc., not necessarily the permanent folks. No, we wouldn't be losing any dock space. Okay, great. And can you just describe the small the small boat storage requirements are those for the dinghies that pretty much are already in existence on the dock or are they is there a requirement for small boat storage space elsewhere? Actually, they're more for the 20 to 30 foot vessels. The industry is finding that. People are. Trailering those in more than they are putting them in the water. It's cheaper to keep them on. Dry on the dry land. So Coastal is. Requiring that that we build some drive or storage. So that's in addition to the dry storage located right off Marine Stadium. Yes. Really interesting. I actually I see that as a good thing because there does need to be a balance. We want people to vote. We want people in a marina. Not everybody can afford the slip fees because they are going up. I think we need to watch that, too. So with that, I turn it back to you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Thank you, Councilman Neal. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. And in regard to your potential timing, under the June, July, the approval of the 10.9 million of titling funds, is that the only option that we have as a council at this body were not to choose that option? Is there a contingency plan or is this really the only option that we have, I guess is my question. Councilmember The original option was not to utilize tailings funds or general fund and we would go on perhaps a ten month hiatus waiting for the bond issue. So we have no plan B except to wait and wait when the bonds are issued by Mr. GROSS. The 40 the $40 million, we hope then we would kick start the marina, but it wouldn't be for about a year, so we would be taking a pause. But this use of the Tidelands funds allow us to kick us into gear right away. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. City Manager. Thank you, Captain Ballantyne. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I wanted to thank the individuals that have come out here tonight. I know you're just a small representation of the larger group of constituents that are interested in this. To start, I do want to thank you for coming up with a financing plan, and I appreciate the timeline for Bass in, too, but really hope that we can get the remainder of the projects done as quickly as possible. In addition to the disrepair. I do think it's such a vital part of our history and the city's identity. I wanted to ask in terms of the timing, Mr. West, you just mentioned what the timing would be, the council's action tonight. How many subsequent actions would you have to come back for in order to ensure that this is on track? And I think you understand my concern here. You have very strong advocates on this council. I would hate for there to have to be a learning curve of sorts, because that would suggest that the community wait even longer . And so to keep this on path in a seamless way as possible, given what our diocese will look like in July. Is this all you need today to keep it on track? Yes. We're not tonight we're not looking for any action from the city council. We were asked to come up with the plan to go forward. This is our plan to utilize the $10.9 million. If there was an objection to that, we would like to hear that tonight. I'm not hearing that. So our plan would be to go to the State Lands Commission in June. I think it's the second or third week of June. Hopefully they will approve this ten point million dollars, 10.9 million to go to basin to. We will come back, I hope, in the first or second meeting in July with the City Council to appropriate the $10.9 million and enter into a contract for basin to. Okay. I appreciate that you don't need an action tonight, but I think you understand my concern. And so while you don't hear an objection, I want to be sure that the point of action is taken as early as possible. This will be. The action from the Council will be the. First or second. Meeting and general. Meeting in July as the first meeting we can get to. After that State Lands Commission meeting in May or June. I'm sorry. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. Any further council comment? Councilmember DeLong And it was along the same side. What I would ask you, Mr. West, is, if at all possible, assuming state lands approves, it is to come back on the first Tuesday in July, the second Tuesday, a difficult meeting with what else is occurring. So that that would be our intention. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Seeing no further council comment, do we have a motion on this yet? I believe we moved in second and already didn't. We move to designate problem. So why don't we turn to the public and item number 23? Any members of the public wish to speak on item number 23? Mary, Judy Clarke has to address a number of issues. Number one, if I read the information correctly, part of this money is to pay Bellingham to stand by and wait because their contract apparently is if it was represented right ends and their contract is up. I don't think we should pay anybody to stand by and wait. What we say to them is bye bye. No, no. And if they want to come back, they come back. All right. I think a better way to approach is to move forward and bow out and do the remaining work, which definitely needs to be done and do it in with wood, not the concrete. Varian allowing our good staff to do the repairs that come up at any point in time. They have the capacity we have the capacity to do it here very well locally. It's divorced from intelligence to hire somebody 1600 miles away that's structured into the cost. When you buy a car, do you buy it from somebody or are you the mechanic or you have to take it 1600 miles away? Makes no absolutely no sense. It's void of intelligence. So the city long has the capacity to get it done with wood and the city staff can repair it and do it very well. Parenthetically, I think we do a vote of thanks to Councilman O'Donnell for finding that original can for that institutional memory and finding those funds from the it went from one fund to another. Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. It comes from my Marine patrol days, many years ago. I know where thank you assembly was made, and I think this needs to be understood. The staff had indicated that the tendency is for larger boats. Not so. Not so. The average. The best. What we are. The target market we should have is those around 34. Once you get beyond 34 feet. You have a problem. You can't take it out as often unless you have a full crew. That's why 90% of these boats just sit there. You need the crew to operate that. So our market is in that 34, up to a 34, maybe a 36. Beyond that, they sit there too long. All right. God the only people to tell you otherwise. Who are the brokers who want to move those things? Period. Additionally, I think that we should understand why that small we need small boats is. We are the only place that has the breakwater we have that gives us, in fact a de facto in the lake where George Joe Sixpack can go out and spend the weekend behind the breakwater without going out into the high seas. Thank you, Mr. Good here. Next speaker. Please. My name is John Mrazek. I live at 5381 East Appian Way. Firstly, I would like to thank Councilman de Long for his support in this. I mean, we disagree very often, Councilman de Long, but I do agree with you in this case, and I thank you for your support. I was a little incredulous at the staff's report that there was 10.9 million missing from the Marina Fund, that that we were penalized for going on, what, 18 years now? You know, I don't know how that could have happened. And, you know, to be honest with you, I think we should probably request interest back from the Tidelands funds for our $10.9 million loan amounts are a little incredulous that the work will not be done on the slips and base and two and three except for the electrical work, we hope. And yet the staff is recommending greater than market increases and slip fees to get us to a market position when in fact that we have substandard slips and we have slips that don't deserve that type of slip feet. I also notice that we gave tonight the Long Beach Slope Club a break in their permit fees. Well, if we're sending in substandard slips, I think that the basin two and three should also get a permit or get a break in our slip fees for being in substandard facilities. I'm not going to say my fourth point because it's not politically correct, but I will comment on Mr. Good, his comments. As you know, to be honest with you, Mr. Goodhue, unless you're down at the marina, unless you own a boat, you don't know what you're talking about. You know, I'm I'm not a yacht broker, and I do take my boat out. And I love being on the water. And I can tell you, everybody here loves being on the water and lesser slips. So let's finish the marina. Thank you. Thank you. Male speaker, please. Good evening, and thank you for allowing me to speak briefly. My name is. Richard Winslow, and I live in. Leisure World in your neighbor to the south. But I'm a small stakeholder. I say that without modesty. I have a 38 year old. 33 foot sailboat at Alamitos Bay. I'm on Gangway 17, and it's been receiving quite a bit of recent maintenance. And some of you may know that at least two people have fallen off of or into the dock in Basin two lately and injured themselves. In a minor way, fortunately. But the idea of. Possibly waiting or delaying the beginning of repairs, I think, is not a wise course. You have not. Only an asset to protect that you owe the the city and the county even. But also the. Potential of liability. For people who might get injured as a result of. Deficient dock. We were as careful as we can be when we're walking around. But even with. That, the docks breaking and boards are simply not sufficient. So, you know, I think any delay would be as likely to cost you more in liability. Potential liability for personal injury and possibly for damage to the boats more than you could hope to sail at. To say if by. Delay I would. Echo and had already planned to suggest that asking for $10.9 million from someone who in effect borrowed it 20 years ago is not what you'd expect from a. Bank or anything else. If you borrow something for. 20 or 30 years, you pay back. Three times as much as you borrowed. You're not likely to get two or three times that back from. The Tidelands, but I think at least. Negotiation should begin with trying to get twice as much back or try to find out. What value they got from borrowing that ten and. Almost. $11,000,000.20 or 30 years ago. And what they. Pay back should reflect some of that. And hopefully the the city attorney can advise you on whether that's. You know, it's legal. To require them to pay back something on the investment. Something for borrowing the money. Pretty much. That's all I had to say. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hello. My name is Operator Fernandez. I live in. 22 Northumberland Drive now. I mean, this bay and. The part I want to bring up is something new that just. Was brought up to me. Last week. I'm also on the board of directors of the The Measurement Laboratories Association. And is that sailboats with draft deeper than six feet. Are getting stuck in the. Fairway at low tide through tide and below? And actually, they did send me the pictures of a couple of those that are coming in and they're slip at low tide. They're getting stuck as they're coming. Into the fairway or trying to get into the slip. So that's besides the docks falling apart, which they're doing. The main is doing a great job on it. Now we're getting boats that are adding to the danger because they're coming in and then there's either got to call, vessel assist or wait to the higher tide to continue on. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Bob Hubbard. I'm a resident of the third district. And I have a boat on Gangway 14 and Basin two. I just wanted to encourage anybody on the council or. On the city staff that hasn't. Gone out and walked along some of those docks to do it. I know that it. Seems everybody's in support of doing this rebuild as soon as possible. But it can't be delayed. Those places, those things are dangerous. Just a couple of months ago, there. Was a problem with my slip, and when I reported it to the city maintenance, I was told, okay, well, they'd take my request. I was number. 56 on the list for major maintenance. On a slip. So that they'd get to me in a few months. You know, I know they're doing a good job. They've got limited funds, but they can't keep up on my gangway. There's at least two or three more slips that are in situation like. Mine was a couple of months ago. Mine got so bad that I finally made repeated calls to Marina Maintenance and they they declared it emergency and came out and fixed it somewhat. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's way better than it was. It was sinking. The the finger on the dock was angled such. That you couldn't walk down it. So we can't delay. And if you haven't. Been out there and looked at it, please do. As to concrete. Versus replacing with wood, again. Obviously that I couldn't see that as a viable option. The way the wood is now, it'd be the same way in a shorter period of time than concrete. So anyway, I just encourage everybody to to do everything you can to make this move forward as fast as we can. They're just not safe. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Pardon me, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Rick Duryea. I'm the chairman of your Marina Advisory Commission. Once again, you've heard all the impassioned pleas by your tenants, your boat owners, as well as staff and their recommendations on how we move forward with this project. I think it's important that the Marina Advisory Commission go on the record of supporting what has been presented to you tonight. We've met with the Director of Parks, Recreation and Marine and his staff, and we are unanimous in wanting this project to move forward as quickly as possible. We believe that staff has found a viable way to do so. And we urge your support tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council people and staff. My name is Carl Kern Bauer and the past president of the Long Beach Marinas Boat Owners Association. And very impressed like this. Special thanks to Councilman DeLong and Lowenthal for your assistance in helping this all come together and very impressed with the 10.9 million, obviously. And yes, I encourage support and the opportunity to perhaps get some interest on this 30 years of money that have been held, which would be very helpful for getting the rebuild going. But I've been around. I've had my boat. And I don't know how many years I've been in the Long Beach Marinas decades and in the past, I heard perhaps I'm incorrect, but I heard that the DBA, Department of Boating and Waterway funded substantially or perhaps all of our rebuild. I can be wrong on the amount, but a very, very substantial funding of our rebuild that's d ball to parting of waters. And by the way the ball is 100%, from my understanding, funded by us boaters, supposed to be dedicated only for use for boating people. Okay, so like funding the marina. I was wondering if y personally why I did not hear one word from the city manager about d ball and perhaps I'm talking the wrong thing, but shouldn't we be looking at DBL for funding of this marina rebuild as we've done in the past, all that money that goes into the ball comes from us boaters. So thank you for your time. Hopefully we can look into D ball. Thank you. I would like. Thank you. We'd like the finance director to just respond to that. Sure. When I discussed looking for bonds, we will be including looking at DBA as a possible option for the loans or in addition. So that's just automatically included. We agree with the we will look at Devo. Great. Any other statement? No other public comment? Any other counsel comment on the item? We have a motion on the floor, I believe, Mr. Kirk. Yes. So, Members, please go ahead and cast your votes. Motion carries equal access. Great. Thank you and thank you all for coming out again.

I'm going to double check on the CSP grant to make sure that that's true of that grant. Okay. I can just tell you, when I was there, it was done every year because you get annual allocations and there are certain categories. So for me it would be helpful to know what are we funding and who are the providers we've been funding. I'm okay with the bill going forward, but I just wanted to learn a little bit about whether the procedure has changed. Is it a staff person doing that? Is there still a committee in place? I will get that information to you. I will get you the list of who the vendors are going to be, because those contracts are in the works right now. Most of them are, you know, have been previously funded through us. So is it primarily emergency services? Yeah. Emergency service providers? Yeah, there'd be shelter providers. The funding is relatively flexible, as you probably know. So a lot of it is designed to try to keep people from losing their housing and and shelters. And so it's it's fairly broad. But we'll get to the specifics of who the vendors are that are going to be contracted with for this funding this year, as well as the what specific services that they're going to be delivering.

Only answer preceding resolution 28885 to the extent inconsistent committee recommends the resolution be adopted as amended. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Casmir Muscovite, you are the sponsor of this resolution and are recognized to address this item. Thank you, Madam President. This resolution moves us towards a goal that I have been asking for since becoming budget chair. And I think it's really important that we look at the details in the proposal that was sent down. I want to thank Council Member Herbold for flagging this in our earlier conversations as well. One really important thing that you will see here is the amendments that we have made to Resolution 31954. Each year the council goes through a budget process, and even years like this one, we endorse a budget for the auditor. This provides some guidance, but no concrete stability to departments. I'm really looking forward to making sure that we provide concrete, transparent, accountable information that can go between branches of government and can be shared with the public to flesh out a process in the next few months here that I hope will work for long term planning and long term stability as we seek greater outyear forecasting to allow for the Council to deliberate on items in front of us so that we can make sound financing, sound financing decisions, in particular during this economic downturn that we're in. Moving towards a shorter budgeting process makes sense to be able to do a truly reflective two three to truly reflect economic conditions. But we also must continue to have biannual budgets and seek further analysis for outyear conversations around our budgeting to ensure stability and transparency with the public. Those are the amendments that we've included today. Appreciate all of your support on that and look forward to working with you as we finalize details on what that process will look like. Thank you so much, Councilmember Musketeer, for that description of this particular resolution. Are there any other comments on the resolution? Councilmember Verbal, please. Thank you. I really appreciate Jerry Mesquita for bringing forward her amendment. This amendment address my concerns about the diversion proposed by the mayor to not just establish a one year process for 2021, but also repeal the resolution that was adopted back in 1994 to establish a two year budget process. A two year budget process provides counsel and the public greater transparency, as well as a better opportunity to plan for four out years. So keeping that as the default process makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the focus on and Councilmember Morales I'm sorry, customer mosquitoes amendment on increasing transparency for both the council and the public. And I also want to give a shout out to central staffer Tom Meisel. I know the he wrote a budget a budget issue paper on this. And I definitely appreciated the analysis that he did that made me think twice about the the mayor's resolution. And I lost track of it. The good work that he had done in that in that budget issue paper. And again, really appreciate chair Ms.. Ada bringing it back before us. Thank you. Thank you.

All right, we've got it on final consideration for passage. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for council bill one, three, two, two is open. And we're going to have the staff report here from Councilmembers Flynn and Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. Councilwoman Ortega and I are very pleased to bring this forward for the last couple of years. Some of us have been discussing how best to recognize the contributions of Kathy Reynolds, Councilwoman Kathy Reynolds to this body, to this city, and to all of its people. And I think they are only regret is that she is not here with us any longer to see this happen. But I don't know if Councilwoman, if you want to make a few opening remarks. I just want to thank Councilman Flynn for working together in bringing this forward and reaching out to former colleagues, many of which are either here or online. That will be speaking to you shortly. But when we explored what made sense, naming the chambers was like the perfect solution to honor Cathy Reynolds. And it will be something that will, you know, last forever. I mean, this this building was built to last forever. And Cathy's contributions were just enormous. And we'll we'll walk through those shortly. Thank you. Before we get started, I do want to recognize one person here in the chamber that we haven't seen in a very long time. There are as many former members of this body who are here. But there's one gentleman here who served on the third floor for many years, and that is our former city attorney, Dan Muse, who is here with his wife, a SEAL Harmer. Dan, thank you for your service to the city. Dan was city attorney for many years under Mayor Wellington Webb and I spoke with him right before this. He said Cathy is just one of a kind and he's he's very pleased that council's taking this step. Let me tell you exactly why we have filed this bill and believe that this is something that ought to be approved unanimously. Up until 1975. No woman had ever been elected to this body. In the year 1975, two women were. Kathy Reynolds holds the distinction of having been elected first because the second woman elected that year. Kathy Donahue had a runoff. And so Kathy Reynolds was elected in May and Kathy Donahue was elected in a runoff in June in District ten, which I don't think was perfect at that time. Councilman Hines But but she helped to make it so and so. Two women took office that year sitting among 11 men. She was reelected a total of seven times. There are three other members of this body. Who have been elected seven times. One was the longtime councilman from what was then District eight and five points, and that's Elvin Caldwell. Councilman Caldwell, though, did not serve the entire 28 years. So Councilwoman Reynolds has the record of tenure. That is the longest. Councilman Caldwell was appointed during his seventh term as manager of safety by Mayor McNichols, so he resigned his seat during that seventh term. The other council member who served seven consecutive continuous terms is the gentleman memorialized on the plaque by the door into our office. And that's Paul Hensel, who served seven terms out of District four in southeast Denver. The other member of this council, who will have served seven complete terms, is standing to my left, and that is our councilwoman, Debbie Ortega. Councilwoman Ortega, Ortega's tenure is discontinuous. She served four terms until term limits took effect in 2003. And then, as we all know, she was reelected to this body in 2011 and is serving right now her seventh term and will be termed out at the end of this particular service. I mean, I think it is remarkable and very honorable of Councilwoman Ortega that while she will match Councilwoman Reynolds in years of service, she is a co-sponsor to this and is is fully supportive. I don't know, Councilwoman, if you want to make some remarks on that. So I just want to say I had the pleasure of serving with Councilwoman Reynolds. Alongside many of her colleagues who are here tonight. And she was an incredible individual who was a mentor to all of us, newbies who came on. When I got elected, there were four new council members and it was enough to sort of shake things up a little bit in terms of looking at doing things a little bit differently. But she truly was an individual who brought a lot of knowledge and was always willing to sit down and answer questions and just offer her wisdom. When I was struggling with with varying issues, we worked very closely together on a build out of the Central Valley. The Pepsi Center was in my district. She and I served on the committee together. And, you know, we'll talk more about her contributions. But it it is just an honor to be able to do this tonight and to recognize Cathy in this way for her many, many contributions to this city that will be in place for many, many years into the future. She, Kathy Reynolds will have the longest continuous service of any council member by a quirk of a charter. And as former city attorney muse may remember this, but after the 91 mayoral election and the very hectic runoff that year, that led to Mayor Webb taking office almost immediately after the runoff and not having the time that should be afforded to put together an administration. There was a charter amendment put on the ballot to push the inauguration back to the third Tuesday in I'm sorry, the third Monday in July. It used to be the first Monday in July. So Councilwoman Reynolds will have that record over Councilwoman Hensel on the wall over there, excuse me, by two weeks. During her tenure, Councilwoman Reynolds served alongside. 38. Different members of the council four times. She was elected council president. She actually served five terms because when Councilman Caldwell was resigned to become manager of safety. Councilwoman Reynolds had been pro tem and she became acting well. She became the president for the rest of Councilman Caldwell's year as president. Eight times she was elected as council president pro tem. Since the election of 1975, when council members Reynolds and Donohue became the first two women that seemed to open the floodgates for women in office. Here's one of the flood gates right here. And we have in seated in the audience, we have a number of women who were elected to this body subsequent to that. And I don't know if this was the appropriate time. Could all members. It is because I just said it could. All members who have all persons who have served on this body, please stand up and be recognized. Thank you. It should be noted, though, that Kathy Reynolds was not the first woman to serve on the body. I purposely put in the presentation first woman elected because of one of those vagaries of history. In 1935, as you can see in this newspaper article, who was there was Eugene Bartholdi from North Denver, who resigned. About. Four months before the end of his term in 1935. And Mayor George but goal appointed a woman, Elissa Paladino from North Denver to fill out the last four months of that term. And she did not run again. And I wanted to draw your attention to her quote at the bottom of that story. It says, You can bet Mrs. Paladino said, you can bet I won't neglect my cooking and sewing. I cannot imagine don't stab me in the back here. I cannot imagine those words being said to a newspaper reporter by Sal Carpio or Ted Hackworth or Paul Schwalm or Tim Sandoz. Right. Or who else is your Charlie Brown? Charlie Brown here now. So since that election go from 1979 onward, 31 of the 56 people who've been elected to this body since 1979 were women. A majority, 31 out of the 56 people elected to this body were women. This is crazy. I also want to acknowledge the men who are not here, who are no longer here, who Cathy served with. And that was Councilman Bill Roberts, Sal Carpio, Hiawatha Davis. Bill Zeigler. Elvin Caldwell. Sam Sanders. Ted Hackworth. Bob Kreider. Paul Hensel. Ed Burke. Joe Nolan. Larry Perry and Ken Macintosh. These are all you know, this was when it was predominantly a male body. But these are men who are no longer alive. And I wanted to acknowledge them. Thank you. So I want to go on to some of the policy initiatives that we believe merit naming this room where these events took place, where these initiatives were passed and the debates took place in recognition of the person who advanced them or primarily advanced them, because I think Councilwoman Reynolds would not ever say that she did this alone. She was collaborative. She worked with anybody and everybody who could get the ball across the goal line. Right. So one of the one of the nation's first gay rights laws passed in Denver in 1990 with significant debate and controversy, such controversy that led in part because other cities around the state also passed similar laws around the same time. But it resulted in an event many of us remember it came out of Colorado Springs was Amendment two in 1992, and that was a constitutional amendment that passed by the people of this state that said no city can adopt any gay essentially any gay rights laws. This was challenged up to the state Supreme Court and eventually went to the United States Supreme Court in 1996 and resulted in the landmark ruling that extended equal protection based on sexual orientation. You will hear tonight. You will hear tonight from two individuals who were central to that debate. They. One of them flew in from Portland, Oregon, to be here tonight to talk to you about those times and some of the hate and division that. Roll out of that debate. Councilwoman Reynolds also was a leader in changing the city's most restrictive zone district regulation r zero zoning under the old 1956 code. R zero zoning was the most exclusive in the city. And one of the regulations was that. No unrelated adults could live together. Unmarried couples could not live together. Effectively, this was a barrier, a bar prohibition. Two gay couples living in some of our finest neighborhoods. You know, it only applied in the zero zone, but we're saying, well, you all can live somewhere else, but you can't live here. And she was instrumental in leading the charge to have that repealed. She also led a successful drive for the budget amendment that we know today as the the mill levy for people with intellectual developmental disabilities. That was hotly contested both here on the floor and on the third floor. This was during the Pena administration, I believe, excuse me. And there was actually kind of a raucous debate. I won't name the names. And I think who told me about this? I think it was former councilman Ed Thomas told me about this. And Councilman Ortega, I think you were council president that year that this was being debated. Councilwoman Reynolds got into a heated argument on this floor with a male member of the body who shall remain nameless. And it got so intense that I was told the Council on President Ortega said from that desk, Madam President, would you to take it out in the hall? Whereupon Councilman Thomas shouted from his desk. My money's on Reynolds. And. And he won because that mill levee did pass. And it has been extended by the voters of Denver once Tabor came into effect. The voters of Denver approved increasing that mill levy sometime in the early to late nineties. I don't have the exact year. Let me just add, when when that passed, it was only generating like around $1,000,000. That fund now generates upwards of it's a full mill. I don't remember what that is now, but when I came on in 2011, it was at about 13 million, and now we think it's closer to 20 million. So it's making huge impact on people with developmental disabilities. And Cathy should be so proud of that work that she did. And finally, the other initiative that we want to bring to your attention is one that I recall vividly when I was when I was a reporter, the Rocky Mountain News. I remember the intense level of threats that threats that came in to this office over here against the councilwoman because she was the prime sponsor of the first assault weapons ban in Denver, the one that eventually survived court challenges and challenges from the state legislature to preempt our home rule ability to take such action in the here in the city. I remember many times after Monday night that she had to have a police escort to her home in Park Hill because of the threats that were coming in. And we have had the pleasure of the sheriff's department being at our Monday night meetings on a regular basis. And I can remember having to be escorted out to our cars after that legislation passed, because the threat wasn't just directed at Kathy, it was at the whole body because we passed it. Some things don't change, do they? Project initiatives. I intentionally led this presentation, Madam President, with policy initiatives. But I also want to talk about project initiatives because Councilwoman Reynolds, along with many of the folks you see here behind us. Played central roles in the development of so many things that the people of Denver right now take for granted the Colorado Convention Center, the new Colorado Convention Center. Where should it go? Remember, comes from there were three different sites that were Central Platte Valley, the Golden Triangle, or right downtown. Imagine what this city would look like if instead of a transit hub behind Union Station, there was a convention center. I think that was the Marvin Davis site. And then the site behind where the library is now. There wouldn't have been a library expansion if we had made that mistake. The Convention Center Hotel, which is now the Hyatt Regency Denver International Airport, of course, Coors Field, the new Broncos stadium, the Pepsi Center, which is now changed its name, I think, to Ball Arena. I used this picture. Thank you to Leah and Carla SHAPIRO from The Denver Post, the editor who allowed us to use these photos. This is. This is a photograph that really says something about Kathy Reynolds being working with a group of men right over there in that corner that if you recognize that's that window over there, she is the person with her. Back to you and her purse on the floor. I'm going to steal one of Rick's stories. Rick told me that one day a constituent got in Cathy's face and said, You know what your problem is, Reynolds? You never saw a project that you didn't like. And if there's anything you can say about Kathy Reynolds, one of the first things will be she was very quick witted. She would think of the rest of the responses. Take me three days to come up with. Right? She got right back in the guy's face and said, no, you never saw a project that I didn't like. She was also a leader in representing Denver outside of this room. She served all 28 years on this body as the rep, as one of the representatives to the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District Board. What we now call the Mile High Flood District, including the last 23 years as the board chair. And you will hear during the public hearing from the former head of the of what they called advocate, I remember a councilwoman around was giving reports the committee saying she had gone to an urban drainage luncheon that month and giving a report on. I thought nothing is less appetizing than an urban drainage luncheon. I have no idea what they served there, but doesn't sound appetizing. She was twice elected as president of the Colorado Municipal League, and in your email you have a statement of support from the former president of the Colorado Municipal League, Sam Mamet, who is on travel and could not be here tonight and deeply regrets that he could not be here. But he sent a statement that is in your email. She was elected president of the National League of Cities in 1987, serving as basically the chief spokesperson for municipal issues in the country, testifying in Congress several times during that year as president. And after leaving council, she was a charter member of the Citizen Oversight Board and served on the Colorado Convention Center Hotel Board. I want to just. Yes. So when she was the president of the National League of Cities, she encouraged all of us to get involved with the National League of Cities. We attended many of their annual conferences. It gave us an opportunity to learn about best practices being done in other cities, to come back with new and different ideas. And I just appreciated that about her because it just continued to help with the growth and the knowledge and the ability to just look at things differently. Thank you. I love this picture. It shows a bit of determination and kind of the pursed lips. Right. And she must be really mad at something. I don't know what it was. Maybe it's one of my stories in The Rocky. I don't know, but. When we were looking a couple of years ago for where could we find a place to recognize Cathy's contributions? We looked around, but she served at large, and so she didn't have a district where there was a park that she championed or a rec center like the Kala Madison Rec Center or the Shimer Rec Center or the Hiawatha Davis Recreation Center. She was citywide and we were kind of brainstorming. There's no park, there's no rec center. And it was one of our former legislative analysts. You might remember Shelley Smith. Who just popped up and said, Why not the chamber? Because of the variety, the breadth, the depth of her accomplishments. What better place than the room in which they occurred? The room where it happened, if you will. And so that's why we bring this this bill forward. Let me before you start the public hearing, Madam President, one former member who cannot be here or is not here is watching online. That is Councilwoman Rosemary Rodriguez from Council District three and who served in several other roles in city government. She sent me a message that she I don't know if she wanted me to read it. Maybe she'll kill me when she when I see her next. But here's what she said. Here's my synopsis of Kathy Reynolds. There is a song from the show Gypsy, that is sung by Mama Rose. The relevant lyric is this. You either got it or you don't. And guys, I got it. That describes Cathy's relationship with Denver. She knew the code. She knew the players. She knew the people. What a wonderful idea to name the meeting room for the woman who convened countless meetings for Denver's diverse, disparate and disagreeable. She knew our people and loved us all. Full stop. I also want to mention I don't I didn't see I don't know if we have online. Former Councilwoman Elena Wedgeworth. She online is she signed up to speak as well? Excellent. Okay. Thank you. And so, Madam President, with one more moment of indulgence, I want to mention one other person who is here who flew in from Washington , DC. Where? Oh, Judy. Judy Gold was Kathy Reynolds council aide and started at a time when it was very unusual for us to have assistants working with us. Right. So, Judy, I want to thank you for coming in, flying in from D.C. to be here for this special moment. And with that, Madam President, I'm told Mayor Webb is also on line. To speak since Mayor Webb is on line. I wanted to show everybody that among her effects, 1996, 1997, the mayor's box at Mile High Stadium. The tickets were always divvied up between the mayor's office and the city council. And there was quite a blowup. Maybe Mayor Webb. He might not address this. So let me do it. These are the last four. Season ticket packages from the 1997 season for the mayor's box and nine in 1997 that never got distributed. And there are still ink in Cathy's files. And so it's a little bit of history. I don't know if it's too late to get them to the mayor now, but I'll give them back to Rick. With that, Madam President, I don't know if, Councilwoman, you have any more remarks before we open the hearing. The only thing I would add is that when. Judy Gold was a council aide to Councilwoman Reynolds. Ramona martinez was one of the other aides. I think they were the first two that were hired on to work for members of city council. And then Ramona went on to replace Sam Sanders as a member of council. But they paved the way for council as well. And back then, there was only one aide for council member. It grew. It has grown over time. So thank you all for allowing us to do this presentation. We're truly honored to bring this forward and look forward to hearing from her former colleagues as well. Very good. Well, thank you. Councilmembers Ortega and Flynn for the presentation. We always appreciate learning a bit more about the history and the remarkable accomplishments of Kathy Reynolds. This evening, we have 14 individuals signed up to speak and we're going to call the first two who are joining us online. And then the rest of the speakers are here in chambers with us. And so our first speaker this evening is Wellington Webb. And we need to see if you are on line. We have one call in number and we believe that that is. Former Mayor Webb. But we're not. Seen it now. Okay. All right. We're going to go ahead and we will try to get him back into the queue. But we're going to go ahead and go with Elba. Wedgeworth is our next speaker. Okay. We can. We want you to go ahead and we can hear you now. Go ahead, please. We're not able to hear you. You might have to unmute. I think we're having some problems with the mike. And so we might need to have you leave the Zoom meeting and log back in. And when you log back in, make sure to connect your audio up. We're showing that your audio's not connected. And so we'll go ahead and try to get those two online speakers back into the queue. And so in the interest of time, we'll go ahead and transition into chambers. And the first speaker in chambers is Tim Santos. Good evening, Madam President. Members of Council. My name is Tim Sandoz and I currently reside in Green Valley Ranch and am proud to be able to be here tonight to speak to you about my dear friend and mentor Cathy Reynolds. Now, Cathy Reynolds and my father, Sam Santos, were elected at the same time, in the same term, and they came in to serve together. At that time, my student council advisor was Mr. Rick Reynolds, who just happened to be Cathy's husband. He is the one who taught me Robert's Rules of Order. He taught me Robert's Rules of Order. Kathy taught me how to use those rules, and she taught me very, very well. Kathy was one of the smartest people you ever come across, and she was always very witty, also knew how to count votes. So in addition to taking me under her wing, as she did because my father had passed away and as dad, I have to mention so many other women that were on the council. Debbie Ortega, Ramona martinez. Happy Haines. They all really embraced me because I was Sam son. Sam had passed away and so they were helping me to understand the rules, how we worked, what we did. Well, these same women helped me with the very first major piece of legislation I was passing, and I was sitting right where Councilwoman Sandoval is sitting at the time . And I was waxing eloquent about how well we had done all the work that had happened. And then slowly a message from Councilwoman Reynolds, who happened to be present at that time, skipped across table to table to table till it got to me. And I opened it up and it said, You have seven votes. Keep on talking. You'll only have six. That was Kathy Runnels. She was sharp. She was quick. She was very and she also was very straight forward about the things that I needed to do and helped really for me to grow as a member of council. Now, as I look at the time. Oh, it's not from Kathy Reynolds, she said. You're talking too much. Thank you all very much. All right. Thank you very much. Oh, we're going to go ahead and move back online because I believe we've got Elvira Wedgeworth. We've got her back in the queue. Yes. Can you hear me now? Hello? Can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Thank you. And good evening, Madam President, and members of the Denver City Council. My name is Alper Wedgeworth and I live in the Whittier neighborhood in Denver and District nine. I also wish to thank and acknowledge Councilwoman Glenn and Councilwoman Ortega for their efforts to name the Denver City Council Chambers in honor of Cathy Reynolds. I work with and personally knew Cathy Reynolds since 1989 when I began my public service career serving as a senior analyst on the Denver City Council staff. I worked directly with Kathy on some of her legislative policy issues regarding the ban of assault weapons in the city of Denver and many others. I was always impressed, very impressed with Kathy's thoughtfulness, her tenacity and her sense of humor. She was also always very kind and encouraging and a great steward of this institution. Kathy always encouraged me to learn and have a self-education on public policy in a way that would be balanced and also, to be fair, to approach all issues . Kathy was a very strong woman who was able to break down the stereotypes of leadership during that time. As was said tonight, very few women have this leadership role in government and to break those glass ceilings so other women would be able to follow. She was very determined. And at times quiet and always thoughtful and always grounded in her leadership and her ability to make a difference and to communicate and have to say again. She had a tremendous sense of humor. Kathy would always make you laugh about a lot of different things all the time. I truly appreciate also her courage and her confidence and her leadership and her passion. Our public service as she spoke, to be open for change and to be positive and proactive, suggesting things to you that you should consider. I will always be thankful to Kathy for her encouragement and her friendship and the many things I learned from her over the years. When I became the Denver City Council president myself. Kathy was many great things and woman of many accomplishments. Ever. I believe that she was proudest of being a wife, a mother, grandmother, and a friend mentor to everyone. Now and in the future. I will always think fondly of Kathy and the role she played in my journey of public service and her leadership on behalf of the city of Denver. I will always, always be thankful to her. To Rick and the family. We were blessed to have her in our lives, and we thank you for sharing her with us. So thank you, Cathy, and thank you, members of Council for your consideration. Thank you. Our next speaker is in chambers, Stephanie Foote. Good evening. Members of Council, um, councilman flynn and Councilwoman Ortega. You guys did just an incredible job that brings tears to my eyes to see these pictures of Cathy. Because I remember I was on council. I was elected in 1983 and I served three terms. I was a really a newbie to government, but I knew that in 1983 I had a nine month old baby and Mike, my campaign, when I talked to people, I said, if we don't do something right now, Denver's not going to be here when my kids grow up and there's not a place where they can work. I came to council. I had no idea how this process worked. I was I know you're going to find this hard to believe, but I was terrified. And I had to learn the rules. I had to watch what everybody else was doing. Cathy mentored me through all that, and then at the end of the first year, she took me in her office and as only Cathy could, she said, Steph, you've been here a year now. You can talk from that time on, whenever I needed any kind of guidance, I needed help. I needed to understand from the absolutely best public policy mind that I have ever known or been close to. She helped us all. All of us. I think that had the the beauty of spending time with her to gain that knowledge that we did not come here with. We dealt with huge issues. We you saw her list. We came in at the time. I came in with the new mayor, Mayor Federico Pena. And it was really a struggle to form coalitions, to understand what everybody's point of view was. But you all know that, and Cathy in particular, that we had to have all the arrows pointing in the same direction if we were going to do the right thing for Denver . So thank you all so much for this. This is just an incredible tribute. It couldn't go to someone more deserving. And Cathy, we love you and we miss you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Happy Hands. Good evening, Madam President and members of Council. My name is Happy Haines. I live in North Park Hill. Actually, I live mostly across the street these days as you live here. Thank you, Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Ortega, for this brilliant idea. I can't think of a more fitting tribute to Cathy Reynolds. A real state's person and policy leader unparalleled. And hopefully it'll inspire a lot more wonderful decisions for many, many decades to come. Um, uh, I. I knew Cathy Reynolds the year she was elected was your first. The councilman that I served under as a council aide, served in the first, was elected that same year when that district was first created in northeast Denver around some concerns about equity in this city. And so I got to know Cathy Reynolds from on the perspective of a city council aide. So when I was elected, as many people here have said, Cathy was a mentor and she was more than that. She was a friend. But when I was first elected, I got called into the room to Stephanie and she told me that I would be consider myself proud to follow my predecessor in every respect but one, and that was to keep my speeches much briefer. And I tried to follow that advice most often. Um, but I think as was mentioned also, she was a teacher. I know Rick really was the teacher in the family, but Cathy was too. And she considered a government governance and public policy a lifelong learning experience. And so you've heard from the presentation all of the organizations that she belonged to, both locally and in this state and across this country. And she used those opportunities and encouraged all of us, likewise, to use those as learning experiences, because we didn't know at all here. She didn't know it all, none of us did. And so we could take advantage of what was happening across the state, across this country and constantly learn. And that's what she was in every organization. She was such an extraordinary leader. And Cathy was a kind of leader. She was a go to person in a get it done kind of person. So she believed in getting things done, not at the expense of principle, but she believed that there were always there was always a way, not only one way, but a way. And so she used her power of creating relationships and listening to people and connecting with people both inside this chamber and outside throughout the city to bring people together to hash it out. I never saw her run away from a fight, ever. But we're at our time. And so. I. Want to let you know. So thank you very much for allowing us. Thank you. Thank you. Next, the good guys, Scott, Scott Tucker. Scott Tucker. There you go. Thank you, Councilmember. My name is. Scott Tucker, and I was the. Executive director of the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District. And Kathy was my boss for 23 years. She was chairman of the board of the District. Kathy had a wonderful sense of humor. And I think you see something is kind of common as we go through this. But as she always referred to the UDV seed as a deferred, you'd f you D and I was always worried when she made presentations before like the in the Senate or the House and legislative issues. And I was always grateful when she did not use that term. You might remember the seventies and eighties were really. Very. Tumultuous times between the suburbs and in the city. Some of you might see some of the seasons, cities, season citizens might remember the POUNDSTONE amendment that restricted Denver's ability to annex. There were just a lot of difficulties there. The board of directors was made up of the mayor of Denver, three Denver council people, four mayors appointed by the governor from suburban communities and. Five county commissioners, and then two. Engineers appointed by the board. And she was able to handle them very, very nicely. And out of that mixture were 25 years of of getting things done. And that's, I thought was just really, really fantastic. She was very smart and intellectually, both intellectually and politically, and she had a wonderful way with people and of expressing yourself. And quite simply, people trusted Kathy and believed her. The highlight of the month for me when I was I meet with Kathy for lunch right before the board meeting two or three days before the board meeting, and that went on for 23 years. They added it up that it was not like 240 or 230 lunch meetings. We discuss the issues of drainage and. Flood control and all those arcane subjects. And finally, I'd like to thank Kathy and Rick. They introduced my family to Gilbert and Sullivan. And Rick, thank you very much for that refrigerator that and thank you very much for allowed to speak. Thank you. Our next speaker is Tony Ogden. Good evening, Madam President. Good evening, members of the Council. My name is Tony Ogden and I, my husband and I currently reside in Portland, Oregon. I was a Denver resident from the early eighties to 2002, and I had the pleasure of working with candidate Kathy Reynolds on some key initiatives at that time. It is a privilege to be here to speak in support of this bill tonight, and my thanks to her for bringing it forward. You're going to hear lots of stories about Cathy. You've heard a lot of stories about Cathy. Her storied career precedes us. I will speak to one issue in particular. I lasted and testified before this council in 1990, when only one of you was a member of this council. Many of you also were here in support of Denver's Comprehensive Anti-Discrimination Bill Ordinance Number 623. I worked alongside several advocates in developing the original draft of that bill and helped found the Equal Protection Ordinance Coalition with the draft bill in hand. T shook and I knocked on Cathy Reynolds door in about 1988. Cathy opened the door wide for us and offered her support and sponsorship. There seems to be a no brainer today, but in the eighties and the nineties, rights for the LGBTQ community were still being hard to find. Few jurisdictions in the country had a gay rights bill. Only two other cities, Aspen and Boulder, in the state of Colorado, had an ordinance ordinance that included sexual orientation. When we first approached Cathy, she was working to an amendment amend Denver's ah zero zoning. And so we worked with Cathy and others to change the zero zoning because it would serve as the basically the foundation for us to be able to do the work on the Civil Rights Ordinance. Cathy was keen on political strategy, understood the importance of coalition building and of patients. Cathy did not shy away from and what was at times a very ugly and hateful opposition during that time. She was steadfast in her support through an attempted repeal of only the sexual orientation portion of the ordinance. The fight over amendment to and she celebrated with us vindication when the Supreme Court did decide Romer versus Evans. Kathy opened her door when many others would not. On this and so many other issues Kathy supported. She demonstrated leadership and is in the face of significant obstacles, not out of political gain, but out of true conviction, because it was the right thing to do for the people of the city and county of Denver. As others have and will continue to say about Kathy. She loved this city. She was dedicated to it and committed to making it a better place. I would go so far to say, as Cathy's leadership and courage in fighting discrimination is one reason Colorado has an openly gay governor today. I am proud to have worked with Kathy and to have regarded her a friend. Renaming Council Chambers in her honor speaks to what it means to be a public servant. Leadership. Dedication. Commitment. Honor. Integrity. Her name on this chamber will serve as a constant reminder of those values. I appreciate the opportunity to be here before you tonight and to urge your support of this bill. Thank you very much. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Rick Reynolds. Oh, boy. Where? My glasses. Really? Sorry. First of all, I'd like to introduce my son, Matt. My son Bob. Kathy's boys. Thank you all for being here. My name is Rick Reynolds. I live in I am a Denver native and I live at 16th and Locust in Denver. How can anyone talk about three decades of service in only 3 minutes? I won't even try. But what was Denver like? Before Kathy Reynolds served? There were no women in city council. There were parts of Denver where unmarried couples could not live together and same sex marriage was illegal. Those couples did not enjoy the same rights as heterosexual people did. There was no convention center or convention center hotel. There was no city lobbyist at the state capital. The council members did not have a staff. Kathy how did the first one? Judy Gold. Neighborhood organizations were not and were not notified of zoning changes and liquor permits. One could legally own an assault weapon in Denver. There was no dedicated, dedicated funding for the developmentally disabled. There was no citizens oversight board or independent monitor. There was no cable TV in Denver. There were no Colorado Rockies or Colorado Avalanche. Coors Field did not exist. The 16th mall, the 16th Street Mall did not exist. The early Caulkins Opera House was in. It was a small arena for conventions and basketball games. The Better Concert Hall did not exist. Colorado Open Journey did not exist. The Bonfils Theater complex did not exist. DEA did not exist. Lowry was an Air Force base. Kathy had a huge hand in all of these changes. With these changes have happened without her. Maybe so over time. But she pushed them. In her own words. Kathy, if you ever wish to be a celebrity. What would you like to be famous for? I've had about all the celebrity I can handle from one time or another. What I'd like to be known for would be kindness, generosity. And good humor. I'll never know. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Ramona martinez. Well, good evening, members of city council. Madam President, it's this very difficult for a lot of us tonight to get up here and express how we feel about Cathy Reynolds. I met Cathy before she got elected to city council. We went to Washington, D.C. in 1974, a long time ago, and a women's conference that was for women in leadership to learn how to become leaders and leadership roles. Well, the city. Colorado's. Delegation is where I met Cathy because. We had lunch and dinner. Together during the week. We were out there in D.C.. And Cathy got elected right after that conference at Washington. A couple I don't know if it was a year or two later, but she got elected. I grew up in this city. I grew up in downtown Denver. I'm back in my city. In downtown Denver. I lived here all my life. There were never any male, any women on the city council when I was growing up. There were never. Except for album Colwell. I think he was the first minority to ever sit on this city council when I was growing up. And Kathy, she broke the glass ceiling for a lot of you up there. She broke it for me. Look at this. This council is now. Made up of the diversity that this city is all about. Not only did she help build and help us negotiate the Mile High Stadium, I sat with her as a member of the negotiating. Team for the New Mile High Stadium. She made. Sure. That minority participation was involved in our contracts. Denver International Airport. When we negotiated to get percentages, which of course the Supreme Court threw out, said it was unconstitutional. She supported our efforts. Hiawatha Davis, Happy Haines and I worked Debbie worked on that formative action program, goals for the airport. Cathy was right there supporting us, giving. Us the encouragement and negotiating those. Those type of agreements with all the developers in this city. She never back down from anybody. She taught me how to sit down and negotiate against and 17th. Street attorneys. And so did the news. We sat together on the mall and on the stadium, Mile High Stadium. I never did that before. I was just a kid from the west side that grew up in the city, never went to West High School, never thought I would be sitting on city council, never becoming the president like I became a president of the city council. But Cathy Reynolds broke that glass ceiling. Not for me, not just for me, but for all of you up there as well. So nothing is more appropriate than having this named after her. So thank you all for doing that. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Judy Gold. Thank you, Madam President. Members of the City Council. My name is Judy Gold, and I live in Washington, D.C.. I am honored to be here this evening to speak in strong support of Council Bill 21 1322, to name this City Council Chambers for Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds. It was important for me to come all this way to speak. I worked for Cathy Reynolds for 18 years, from 1975 to 1993. I was the first council person, personal staff assistant ever hired in 3 minutes or 30 minutes. I cannot cover all that Cathy accomplished, but I will try to highlight some of her more creative legislative moments. Denver is a greater city today because of Cathy Reynolds. Her innovative work resulted in a way to issue municipal bonds that eliminate conflicts of interest. Psychological testing and training is now required for all police officers to ensure they are qualified to protect and serve, and women can become cops and firefighters. Cathy wrote a law increasing transparency between neighborhood groups in the city via direct lines of communications. In 1990, she authored and passed the gay rights bill that was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Because of her, you have a ban on assault weapons that was also upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. She wrote The Denver law that allows women to seek lawful abortions without fear of harassment. But it was her day to day work that made Cathy most proud. Whether on economic development, housing, health and hospitals, the developmentally disabled or the city budget or even trash, potholes or zoning. Cathy put her heart and mind into all issues. She would cut a deal, but she would never sacrifice her principles. My favorite quote is from her first reelection way back in 1979, when I asked someone if you would vote for her, and he said yes, because he didn't always agree with her, but she would always give him the straight story and never change her position from one person to the next. That was and still is the best compliment ever, because her constituents always knew where she stood, whether or not they agreed with her. Councilwoman Kathy Carter. Reynolds was a unique person and an exceptional elected official. Her constant dedication, coupled with her wry sense of humor, gave her this rare characteristic that provided Denver with quality legislation, funding national recognition and a plan for the future. For all of these reasons and many more. It is extremely fitting that this council chambers be named for her in the future. When people ask, Who is Kathy Reynolds? Someone can explain. She was the best this wonderful city has to offer. I ask for your support. Thank you for your time. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Donna. Good. Donna. Good. Hi. I appreciate being asked to speak tonight. I'm done a good. And until ten days ago, I lived in Park Hill for the last 21 years. I moved into Councilman Black's district ten days ago, and I don't even know where I am. I got nosebleeds when I used to go above Alameda. So I think the reason I'm here tonight is to talk about something that you do hear about sometimes. But maybe we need to remember Cathy as somebody who accomplished everything we've heard about tonight. And maybe we need to remember for something that we've only heard touched on a couple of times. So I'm with commonly known as Political Hack. I've run 17 elections. I worked for two presidents, two mayors, two governors, and a bunch of other people in political office. And what I have learned in all those years is that you can spend time with people, you can work for them. And. They don't really care whether they're working for the people of a city. The people of a country, the people of a state. Or a major corporation. They don't. But what people who are really the ones who make the difference and I can recognize them right off because I've worked with so many of both kinds. But it's what Kathy stood for. I think L.B. mentioned it. Maybe Rosemary touched on it. Tony Ogden. Certainly. Sorry. Kathy had a passion for service. Kathy was the real deal. She cared about every one of us in Denver. And when people say she loved the city, I love Denver. And it means I love my neighborhood, I love my corner cafe. It means I love where I walk my dog. And no matter whether I was working in Pakistan or D.C., I kept the home in Denver, and Denver was home. Kathy loved not just the city, because what does that mean? What it means, I think, is that she loved us. She loved the people of Denver. She wanted us to have better health services. The ability to live in love as we stood. She wanted people who had never been given a chance to be given a chance. She wanted us to be able to take our family to different venues. She loved us. And maybe it's too late to say to her face, but we can say to her family and we can remind people forever by putting in this room that a woman worked here once who spent 28, almost 30 years her life every day dedicated to making this city a better place for each and every person who lived here. She was an early comer with things like LGBT rights. She fought for Denver Hill. She was the real deal. And I appreciate what you're all going to do tonight. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Tisha. He shook. Oh, goodness. Hi. I'm Tisha. I live in Council District 11. Hi. So I met Cathy with my small circle of friends. We're trying to get Denver to pass an equal protection ordinance in 1988. We were young and we were dedicated and we were as ignorant as all get out. Fortunately, there were wiser heads who decided to help us, and Kathy was one of those, as were most of the folks speaking tonight. Her support was crucial in the 1990 Council vote. In Oliver and I will just be forever grateful to. Her for all that. She did. To get that past and to stay with us every time it was fought over and over. Like many. She taught me how to count to seven. What was more important to me was that lesson, and it was a continuing lesson in how to work well with others. Especially those you disagree with. How wonderful. To name Council Chambers. For her. I really hope. That her name and her legacy serve to inspire future council members. Thank you, Councilman Flynn and Councilwoman Ortega for doing this. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker is Joyce Foster. And then we're going to follow with Martin Foley. I've. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the Denver City Council. It is truly a pleasure being in front of you this evening. This was my happiest job. I ran for election when Stephanie Foote was appointed by Mayor Webb to become his chief of staff. And I was recruited. To run. And the only time I ever had been down here was during the amendment that Kathy was running for. Well, if it wasn't for you. My husband was very involved with her. He was the co-chair of No. One to campaign. So I was elected as the first Jewish woman to sit on the Denver City Council and bring that community with me. And I had no idea how many people sat on the city council when I entered the race. I was very naive. I had been working for Jewish family service for 17 years and my whole life I had been recruited. I had been resettling immigrants from the former Soviet Union, from Laos boat people and helping them find jobs and homes. That's what I did for a living. And after I was elected, my first job on city council was to break a tie on who was to be elected city council president. It was between Cathy Reynolds, who I knew a little bit from the the work that she did with my husband and another gentleman who will go nameless . I really thought, well, she's been here so long. She's been president of city council. I'll add somebody else. I'll vote for somebody else. So I voted for the other guy. Whoa. Was that a bad move on my part? Yeah. I was soon to lose my best friend, and I apologized about a year later after I saw and was learning. You know what she did and how well she did it? And I did apologize. And I said, whenever you run for city council president again, I promise I'm going to support you because you are really smart . You're thoughtful. You're respectful. And she's really, really smart. Really smart. And I loved Kathy. She became such a good friend. And Steven and I miss her. We miss Rick. We miss our community. I was on the council for ten years until I was term limited and. Sometimes we would get together and just visit and it was wonderful. And I miss Kathy and I can't imagine a better name for this cherished hall, this treasure that we have in Colorado. So I definitely support this bill. Thank you. Or whatever it is. It's. Thank you. Our next speaker is Martin Place. Members of council. Hi, my name is modestly. I'm a Capitol Hill resident for about 50 years. But probably the longer stake is that I was a city employee for 37 years. Most of that was as a career employee. I was an appointee for under Mayor Webb, and then I was a contract employee. So I sort of every flavor of employee you can have. And I go back to when Kevin Flynn was one of those annoying reporters in City Hall and Debbie was a legislative aide, if I remember correctly, when we first met. So those are the familiar faces on council. Kevin, I should have asked you, was this a promotion or a demotion going from reporter this. So I started five years before Cathy Reynolds became a member of council, had occasion to work with her on a whole host of other of issues because I was the face of the finance office for a much of that time. The main thing I want to affirm is how the extraordinary leadership and sense of service that Cathy demonstrated, manifested and that we others were able to learn from. I knew it. The mayors knew it. The council members knew it. And the people knew it. If you wanted to find out what the straight story is, you talk to Cathy Reynolds. She was also a friend. And I'm very grateful that you're recognizing her in this way. Thank you. Thank you. We wanted to see if we might have Wellington Webb in the Zoom platform. All right. Okay. Well, we tried. We will go ahead and move forward then. That concludes our speakers this evening. Thank you, everyone, for sharing your memories and perspective of her and questions from members of Council on Council. Bill. One, three, two, two. All right. Seen no questions by members of council. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill one, three, two, two. And I hope that we might start out with council members Flynn and Ortega, and we can follow with other members of council after they go. Certainly. Thank you, Madam President. I don't want to lengthen the mindful of what Tim Sanders had said. I want to have a note pass down from Council President Gilmore, but I just want to thank everybody for showing up and reminding folks of what public service is all about, what change is all about, and what meeting the challenge of change is all about, and what it takes to do that. And a number of the people in this room who worked with Cathy in accomplishing that. Really tell that story. It was a group effort. It took a leader, but it took the whole village. Really? Ramona Councilwoman Martinez, your words really, really struck me. And still to this day, your story of how you grew up here and then became yourself president of the council and with the help of Councilwoman Reynolds mentorship. When you worked for Sam and then later when you joined her as a as an equal colleague. Every time I come to this building, I drive by the house that you told me you grew up in, that tiny little bungalow. I can imagine that the little girl who grew up in that rose to the accomplishments that you did and having broken, having benefited from the glass ceiling that that Kathy Reynolds broke. And I and I would have similar remarks for everyone else in the room for for former Councilwoman Haynes, for Councilwoman Foster. Councilwoman Foote. Am I missing anybody? Councilwoman Marcia Johnson was your. Councilman Santos this I can't imagine a better way to memorialize the record of accomplishment that she had than in naming this room. As I said at the end of the presentation, this room where it happened, it's the appropriate place to do it. We have memorialized other people by naming elements of buildings. John Parr, Sandy Weidner, we've recognized with the PA Weidner room, and I think this is a crowning honor for a career that really changed Denver. And with that, Madam President, I would certainly ask for everyone's support for this bill. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. So I had the pleasure of being a council aide along with Judy Gold, along with Ramona martinez, Happy Haines. During the time that she had first got elected in her first term, and we all went on to accept, Judy, to replace the council members that we served with , she was an inspiration to all of us to want to to be like her, to want to make a difference in our community, and to step into those big shoes that were filled by our predecessors. And, you know, to see that we still have this many women serving on the council. She truly did break that glass ceiling for for all of us. And she was she was a dear friend. We all loved her. I mean, just the fact that this many of her former colleagues are here tonight to express those words of appreciation and love that we all had for her. I just thank you all for being here tonight. And I really would appreciate a unanimous support of this bill tonight so that we could officially change the name of this chamber after one of our great leaders, Kathy Reynolds. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Kinney. Thank you. Council President. I am part of the next generation right of council members. So unlike some of the folks who are here tonight, I didn't serve as a council aide and I was a young mom a and looking to run for office as the first out member of the council. We don't know. There may have been other LGBTQ members, but the first one to kind of run as an out individual and Maria Garcia Berry made the introduction and said, you need to meet Cathy. And not just because you're running for the At-Large seat, because you and Cathy, Cathy, Cathy, you know, had a brand of leadership that she she thought I needed to understand and know about. And it was pretty intimidating, actually, to learn about her history in the office and, you know, to be someone who didn't come from inside the city family, because that was clearly something that was really important to a lot of Cathy and her predecessors. And so but I also was really inspired. It struck me the first time I met her, like I might not even have the opportunity to run for an office like this with the background I have, if it weren't for Cathy. And so I was so nervous too to try to live up to this idea that and people would ask me, they'd say, you know, what do you want to do as the first out lesbian in city council? Like what big policies are you going to run for the community? And I would say. The important thing to understand is that straight allies paved the way. That it took those from communities who had not lived in the shoes of being a gay person to pass laws that were inclusive. And that was really important to me, thinking about being a leader, right? When I worked on immigrant issues, I have not walked the shoes of an immigrant in our city or in our country. But having to think about I can't wait for for for only people with that background to lead or, you know, police accountability where, you know, we have a huge community of individuals of color and men of color in particular, to whom police accountability is really important. I can't only represent that issue if I've walked in their shoes. Cathy inspired me and sent the message that you have to lead for all of those communities with their experience and partnership, right? Hearing TE and others talk about how she worked with you and that model of trying to see, I might not have walked in those shoes, but if I can be alongside you, right? Those are the things that I took. And in my early terms on the council, I would get the short emails. You know, some of you might have served before the email era, but I would get the short email from Cathy and I would pretty much know in that one sentence if she liked or did not like a quote in the paper or a vote that I had taken. And I learned to pick up the phone and call her, especially when she didn't like it and she was so curious. She would always actually want to hear why I had voted differently than she thought. And she never cut me off, right? She never was like, You're dead to me because you voted against. She would say, okay, well, I hate it, but you know, and then we'd move on and I'd get the next email and I had done okay. She was still serving on the Citizens Oversight Board in my first term, and that was a topic that we talked about right when there were some hard moments. Our our former monitor had a little more contentious relationship with our safety agencies than our most recent monitor did. And she, as someone who loved the city, loved the mayor and loved the safety agencies, was also really willing to hold them accountable. She did not think those two things were mutually exclusive. And I continue to feel that same way that I can love the city while also wanting us to do better and holding us accountable to those high standards. So those are the things I've taken personally. And as her health began to struggle, we tried to remember her in these chambers in terms of celebrating the anniversaries of the nondiscrimination ordinance as part of the history. And I remember going to visit her at the house. And I will just say for me personally, I often heard from Rick and Cathy together. I kind of feel like I got to know you together. And it's for me very fitting that so much of her service you are so involved in. And so I want to say thank you to you as well, because that inspiration, the trust, the watchful eye, all of that, I feel like was really something you did as a team, and it meant a lot to me, even though I did not work with her in the same way you all did. I felt that mentorship and I felt that support and I felt those high standards and they made me a better councilwoman. So thank you to all of you for the service that you performed for our city and thank you to her family. We know a little bit about the shared sacrifice that a family has for service. And so I thank you for the last dinners, the interrupted birthdays and all the other things that helped make her service to our city so possible. So I'm really excited and thank you to my colleagues for bringing this forward. I think you found the perfect place. So thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Kenney, Councilman Cashman. Know. Thank you, Madam President. I thank you, Councilwoman Ortega, Councilman Flynn, for bringing this this forward. This this pretty humbling for me. I've been I grew up in the Garden State of New Jersey. And on Halloween night, just a couple of weeks ago, I celebrated my 50, 50 years in Colorado, all of that, except for maybe one year in the city and county of Denver. And for a long time as a journalist, I had a community newspaper in South Denver. I spoke to a number of the folks in the room here, including Councilwoman Reynolds. But what I'm remembering when I when I was thinking about running and was even 13 or 14, I called my friend Lynn Preston Hall, who was an aide for Councilwoman Johnson. And I said, you know, how much time does this job take? And she said, Well, you know, she said, Paul, it would be up to you. You know, some people talk about working and then others of them actually work. And she said, My boss works so. I took that to heart and I've tried to work. I don't know that I would ever even aspire to the heights that Ms.. Reynolds achieved, but I do try to try to work. You know, I did speak with Councilwoman Reynolds a few times as a journalist, and I found her to be as described by some of the speakers. She was always would return my call, but she did not seem to be a particular fan of talking to the press, and she was always very direct. She would explain fully, answer my questions fully, but she was not a look at me person. She was. My sense was she was a let's let's get it done type of person. And as I said, you know, she was very direct and to the point. But I did she had the opportunity to see another side of her. The sense of humor that people talk about. I happened to be as actually to I believe that were Fridays to Fridays in a row. I happened to be playing golf over on a golf course and came off the first green. And there was this woman laughing her tail off on the second tee about 20 yards away and got a little bit closer. And it was Councilwoman Reynolds and I don't know what the topic was, but she was laughing about 200 yards down the fairway and having a great time. So I was pleased to hear that side of her. And the other thing I wanted to comment about when I first got elected to office, Albert Brooks was president at the time of council, and he appointed me. To the Urban Drainage and Flood Control Board, and who knew what that could possibly be? And why would I have been subjected to this? And what I came to find out, first of all, is it is one of the most well-run, marvelous organizations I've ever had the privilege to be associated with. I want to acknowledge Dave Bennetts, who's I think government relations manager now for the district and has had a remarkable career for that organization. And the other thing I want to say is when I took the position and Councilwoman Sussman was just leaving that role on the board, the only thing she had to tell me, she came over and whispered. She said, you had the best lunches you're ever going to eat. So, yeah, they they do a good job in that way. But I do want to thank all all the former council members here, former attorney muse Mr. Reynolds, and all the family members for for what you did in setting the table so all of us can be up here working for a city that's with all of its challenges in pretty good shape. So thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilmember Cashman. Councilmember Hines. Thank you. Council President, I this is my first term in office and I never met Miss Reynolds. Did not know her. I. Would say tonight, I want to thank the sponsors for their fabulous presentation. And and I want to thank the folks here in this room. It's just been such a delight to learn more about Ms.. Rental, Ms.. REYNOLDS And what a force she has been in our city. And I am also speaking of delight. I am delighted that she broke a barrier and helped us become, as you have already said, such a diverse council with majority women council, too. And so I just wanted to thank everyone for coming. I feel a little bit I feel like I know her a little bit better, and I'm excited to have this chambers named after her. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Hines. Councilmember Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. Um, so I never had the honor of knowing Cathy, but I know my father, Paul Sandoval, did, and worked with her a great deal. And as a daughter of someone who was elected, I had to share my dad with the community. And I remember going places with my dad, and I would get tired of him talking to everyone. And I would just want my dad's attention. And we would go to on a cruise. I'll never forget we were in Mexico and my dad knew someone on the cruise in Mexico. And it all revolved around Denver politics. And so as a woman who is now currently elected and I have two children at home, I know the strain my dad carried and the strain that she probably carried of being a mother and being a wife and being a politician. And now I see my kids. I go places and my kids are like, Mom, come on, let's go. Do we have to keep talking? And so I just wanted to thank her family, her husband, who sat by her side. My husband's been there for me. I don't think anyone really knows what that's like. And her kids who she had, you had to share your mom with the community and what that feels like of people telling you stories about your mom that you didn't know and exploring things and hearing things. When I was campaigning, I learned more about my dad than I had known. I didn't know. I knew he had a big impact in northwest Denver, but I really learned it. Going knocking door to door and hearing. So just wanted to thank her family because this is a job where you don't get to go home when you just turn it off. You don't. You're everywhere you go. You're Councilwoman Sandoval. You're not the story. And so thank you for her family, for standing by her side for so long and standing in her, because I'm sure she needed to come home and she rented to you all, just like we all as mothers up here and fathers go home. And we went to our significant other in our kids. And so we're all in it together. And for all of you, other women who were elected, thank you for opening the door for me and for my family and for my ability to serve Northwest Denver and get things done. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval and see no other speakers in the queue. I'll go ahead and round it out tonight. I want to sincerely thank council members Flynn and Ortega for sponsoring this. And I see when Council member Flynn started to try to go down the roll call, it makes it tough. So I would just like to acknowledge and sincerely and humbly thank the former council members who are here with us this evening as well and online. You know, some of the things that were said about Kathy Reynolds tonight were she was a strong woman. She was a visionary. She was a passionate servant. She was a get it done sort of person. Her humor, her patience, her kindness and her generosity. Were things that you said over and over again in a little bit different way, but it gave us an opportunity sitting up here tonight to fill. For the ones of us that never met her, feel like we knew her just a little bit. And the humility and. Just great honor that it is to sit up here and serve our city and know the intentional work that it does take to do this job to the best of your ability and to her husband and her two children. I know a couple of my colleagues brought it up, but your sacrifices, because I think that she couldn't serve for almost 30 years and there weren't sacrifices that you all made as family. And that sacrifice changed policy and legislation in Denver for the betterment of citizens that you will never meet. But she did that and you allowed her to do that because having the support of your family members, when you go home to not talk about what happened, to talk about what happened in your life and in your day is so refreshing and so important for us to be able to continue doing our jobs and the coalition building. How she served on the the Citizen Oversight Board. Women's rights. I have two daughters and I want them to consider public service at some point. I want them to know that it's achievable for them and that they can do that and have a city or have excuse me, have a family and still serve the city in a good way, but that you're also serving your family at the same time. And so I'm very honored to support this this evening. And, Madam Secretary, roll call, please. Flynn. Just checking what the snow says. I don't have seven votes. I. Ortega, i. And we would like to ask council members who are in the chambers to all please stay so we can take a group photo with you and our seated council. I think Sandoval. Sawyer. I. Torres, I. Black. I. See tobacco. I. Clark. I. Herndon. I. Times i. Cashman. Can I? Madam President. I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced the results. 13 eyes. 13. I count the bill. 21 guy. 13. 20. They're being for no further business before this body. This meeting is adjourned. Thank you.",A bill for an ordinance naming the Council Chamber in the Denver City and County Building the Cathy Reynolds Council Chamber.

Okay. Councilwoman Pryce. So this item comes as a result of some of the recent audit reports we've received from the city auditor, the job order contract and the graffiti protective coating. Both audits suggested that there would be a lot of benefit to the city if we engaged in better training for employees in regards to working with contractors and overseeing contracts . And I know that the city manager. Is plugged. In to the recommendations. So I think that looking at how we're executing our contracts and RFP process is something that's an ongoing discussion for us. But I'd like to have the city manager report back to us within 60 days regarding some of the procedural changes that we're taking in regards to the audit, but not just in regards to the audit, in regards to things that we've learned through various procurement processes. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I think that this is important for us to do for the stewardship of the city. I think that our city staff are doing a good job and I look forward to recovering what we can and ensuring the policies and procedures are in place to protect us and the citizens in the future. Is there any member of the public that wish to address the Council on 37? Item 37. Councilmember Austin. You'll see that earlier. Sure. Thank you, Madam Vice Mayor. I just had a couple of questions regarding this matter in terms of training. Is there. And does staff foresee there to be a fiscal impact? I'm not arguing against the need. Obviously, there were some some issues with the contracts. I think there's a lot to be said because, you know, oftentimes we often hear that it's it's it's it's more efficient. It's it's less expensive, it's more effective to oftentimes contract out work that that is done and often done by. By. Public employees who have stake in the game in terms of their jobs being on the line, having to be accountable long term for for their work. And so I'm I'm trying to I'm kind of kind of confused in terms of the I mean, this this I don't ask for a lot. It asks for training for project managers, employees and consultants. It asks us to develop training programs on contract administration best practices. Do we need to identify the best practices before we do training, and how do we train on best practices and then establishing policies and procedures, which I have no problem with whatsoever. But I guess the question is. From from the city management. Is this something that you feel that we can actually do? I'm an accomplished vice mayor. Councilmembers training is fantastic. So we can always do more training. And so we certainly are embracing the the audits, things that Councilmember Price brought up. So we would definitely come back. We reiterate some of the things that may have got lost in the audits of the training that we actually do and then come back on how we're addressing the audits from the auditor. So we'd be very pleased and proud to do that and then take it a step further. And the things that the Council is asking for this in this agenda item that may that may cause a funding gap or something, and we certainly bring those to the table on how much this would cost or that would cost in the general fund revenue impact on that. But certainly we are responding to the audits. We do training and we definitely plan to do some more. So so there could be a fiscal impact there. There could be, depending on how far we want to to meet all the to meet all the needs of the audit. There definitely would be a full fiscal impact. On that, that you'll come back with that information as well. Absolutely. But I do want to assure everyone at the diocese that we are training and we are stepping up our game and training regardless. We're not going to wait for 60 days to do that. We're doing that. Mr. Beck is looking at those things, and we certainly will come back to address the issues in this agenda item . And I also want to just just point out, I know we've had a lot of turnover in key positions, in administrative positions. And so the training, I think, would could go a long way to to make me feel and make me feel a lot more assured that that we're taking care of business. I think we would agree with that. There's been a tremendous amount of management change in public works, no question. Thank you, Councilman Gonzalez. Yes. Just want to thank Councilwoman Price for bringing this forward. I think in lieu of or in light of what we've seen with the job audit. I think it's good that we just look at ways to develop training and programs. And if we are doing something now, it'd be great to have that included in the report because if we're doing things now that are above what we imagine, then great, we don't really need to go any further. But if we're not, maybe there's some gaps that we can we can bridge the gap and make better. And I want to point out, we can always go further. So training is a fantastic thing. Great. Well, thank you very much. Appreciate it. So any member of the public that wished to address Council on item 37, please come forward. Mr. West was very. Vociferous in his claim that much training was needed. I would say what training is really involved now? Maybe I don't understand it, but graffiti. You simply take paint and paint over it. What kind of training does that take? I think it could be accomplished in one hour at the most. I would suggest that you have one person. To be contacted to observe, to find out where the graffiti is. First, you need to find out where the graffiti is. That's the problem. Particularly where it's prominent. Sometimes it's not. It's inconsequential. So have a person. Establish what? Where it is needed. That's the big problem. Really. What's needed? And have that person train the others in how to put paint on on the subject at hand. Now, as to who should do the graffiti eradication of the paint. I would suggest it would save a lot of money if you went to volunteer groups like the YMCA, even the YWCA, even school while school organizations have volunteers put the coat of paint on the graffiti. Now, maybe I'm totally ignorant, but maybe Mister West can enlighten me. What is the training involved? Mr. West. Just kidding. Thank you, Mr. Dunn. Members, please cast your vote. I. Is it not. Working? Although of all those in favor, any opposed motion carries. Item 40.","Recommendation to request City Manager to report back to the City Council within 60 days regarding what procedural changes the City is developing to address the following issues: • Develop a training program for project managers (both employees and consultants) on managing projects, preparing scope of work, and reviewing proposals. • Develop a training program on contract administration best practices. • Establish policies and procedures for overseeing standardized citywide contracts. • Develop a policy to ensure project managers are certified and certifications are current.","Legislative Item Type:

So with the extension just going until December and a commitment that there will be an RFP and a competitive bid process. I feel I feel okay about going forward with this tonight. Okay. Thank you very much. Madam Secretary, please, with the next item on our screens and council member, can each of you please put Councilor 115 on the floor? Yes, I move that council bill 20 115 consideration and. Thank you has been moved and seconded. Questions and comments by members of council can go back to Councilmember CdeBaca. Go ahead. Thank you, Mr. President. Called this one out because of some issues with the process. It was an early vacation in a challenging area of town, and I say challenging to refer to the traffic pattern of the area. This is right near 38, then one underpass where we have several one ways that back up and create. Really difficult situations for the neighbors and people trying to get through this area. This alley has often been used by people to turn around and go the other direction when there are substantial backups. It was closed off a while back, kind of as a foregone conclusion that. We would. Be passing this vacation tonight. And so I personally wanted to go on record as voting no because I didn't think it was appropriate for them to block off this alley as a private alley before we voted on this. And it has been blocked off for weeks now with without us having approved this. So I'm going to go on record as a no tonight and encourage the applicant to make sure that this doesn't happen again in the future. All right. You don't remember? I don't see anybody else in the queue. So hold on. Let me check big screen here. Oh, Councilman Ortega, you got to. Hold on. There you go. Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to understand a little bit more about what is being proposed at that location. Is there an adjacent development that is looking to vacate. The alley that is. Part of the basis for why this request is coming. Forward? Thank you. Councilmember, I think we have in here. Can you speak to that? All right, come on up and I'll see if we can get you on here. Hold on. Just say it. And Councilmember Ortega, if you can mute your audio. Well, the questions answered and then unmute if there's another follow up. And if you could, you could speak right into that microphone so everybody can hear you. Thank you, John. I know the president is located across the street from the site here. This is our development. For those who remember the city council last year, you may remember these on this property council articles. I just want to say that we are building a grocery here. This is a food desert and your grocery store in this district, in order to pull off the construction of a grocery store, we had to acquire a state highway. How do we know those neighborhood record streets? So we acquire that street at our own expense. And now we need to go forward with squaring off the street and how they got their comments and questions exactly right. It is a very dangerous intersection. It's a very dangerous place because we have a one way street in both directions. Street is one way street. So in addition to building his grocery store, we are going to be converting down the street. And there is pretty much work that street, bicycle safety two way street. And so the 2009 area plan that was adopted by a previous city council. So we're providing a grocery store to alleviate your fixing the very basic infrastructure that it's very, very dangerous. We're also working on providing over a hundred jobs. I think we can all agree to jobs right now. And we're also going to provide affordable housing above and beyond what's required. Councilmember Ortega, if you're unmuted, any follow up. Or you could say just one last quick question. Does the city have any financial resources in the project? Either in the housing or in the commercial component of it. Just curious. Yeah. If I make a decision by May 28 to seek a private discussion with the Housing Department, it has to be made in our company for the building. We will be asking for some collaboration with the city. But if we go to the 80% EMI as part of the agreement, that will be in the contract. So if we're looking for a 60% in my situation, we are going to be working with the housing authority here in the cities to do something for us. But I don't have specifics on that. All right. Thank you. Maybe have a seat in that front row because we have one more person in the queue coming to us from a sunny day directly outside the Building Civic Center Park. Councilmember Glynn, go ahead. Thank you. I hope I can be heard there, Andy. Councilwoman CdeBaca mentioned that the alley has been blocked off. Do you have any explanation for how that happened? You can't block off a public right of way without a permit or some such. What's been going on there? Now, the only thing I can't think of your question is only been locked temporarily for demolition. We have begun demolition. We have a demolition permanently begun demolition of this project. And I have to say this, but we need to get building. We've made a long time to get going this a long time to get our our demolition permanent north, to safely demolish the existing structures. We had to block off the alley, temporarily reopening anything. Okay. Mr. President, just an added comment is that when this was resolved about a year and a half ago, it was it was explicitly stated in the rezoning paperwork that not only would this alley and the little private alley that I think went in, probably in the forties when State Highway 33 was pushed through here, through this neighborhood and divided it the way it does with Lawrence Street and the Marion and Dowling couple, it's going right through that block. It was fully anticipated that these vacations would occur in order to finish off to implement the 38th in Blake Stationery, a plan, reunite those two blocks in the traditional grid. Now that state Highway 33 no longer goes through there. And so this includes not only the vacation of the alley that was originally part of the 1880 something Hyde Park subdivision, but also the little bitty alley on the west side. When the state put Lawrence Street through there, I think in the forties, they got a little private alley that goes through some of the private parcels there. And so this eventually when 36th Avenue is is is completed and the blocks are realigned the way they had been originally. This will restore the community back to what it was. And so I support I support this vacation as part of the plan that was anticipated back in a year and a half ago when the rezoning occurred. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember. Councilmember CdeBaca, I see your hand back up or you're back in the queue. Yeah. Just wanted to thank you, Mr. President. Wanted to go on record. I had a briefing with Dottie this morning, and there was no permit to no demolition permit that allowed the temporary closure of this. And it was also the understanding of community that that the squaring out of the block was going to happen before we got to this stage of the process, because now you don't have the squaring off and you have an even more challenging traffic situation in the area. And so that was why it's an issue and that's why I brought it up. All right. Thank you, Councilmember. I don't see anybody else in the queue. Right? Yeah. Come on. And Councilwoman, if I could just a your information we have to demolish the sites first in order to square Laurel Street to make it safer for the rest of the area. It could be to remove some utilities from the alley into Downing Street. And I believe that was part of your presentation today. All right. I don't see. Check the big screen. Make sure nobody's waving at me. Anybody else in the queue right now? So, Madam Secretary, roll call on 115. Well. I didn't. Like. I. Torres. I need a bucket. No one. I. Time I. Cashman. I. Ortega. I. Sandoval. I. Trump for president. Madam Secretary, please, before the voting announced the results. So that is one thing. Well, I's always one day count. Bill 115 has passed. That concludes the item to be called out this evening. All bills for introduction are published. Council members remember that this is a consent of up and you will need to vote as this is your last chance for an item of reciprocal jobs. The member can easily please put the resolutions for adoption and the bills on consideration or final passage on the floor.

Recommendation to execute amendments to contract with Bellingham Marine Industries and Concept Marine Associates relating to the Alamitos Bay Marina. Rebuild Project and increase appropriations in the Marina Fund in the Parks Recreation and Marine Department District three. Thank you. And I know Councilwoman Price has a presentation to make, so if I can turn it over to her. Thank you very much, Vice Mayor. I want to first acknowledge Rick Jerry, who is here, he's the chair of the Marine Advisory Committee. And I want to thank him for his service and for everything that he's done to support this process. I also want to recognize the hard work and dedication that Parks Recreation and Marine Director Steven Scott and our Marine Bureau Manager Alveda Hallinan have displayed during the rebuild of our marinas a major undertaking and one of the largest infrastructure projects that the city has embarked upon. The city of Long Beach has the largest municipality managed marina in the United States. Our marinas are in the best location in California as vessels are protected by a series of offshore breakwaters and natural bays with easy access to open water and sailing conditions that are nearly perfect year round due to prevailing winds. All three of our city's marinas were originally built in the 1950s and the 1960s, and our occupancy rate has remained steady at 98% and 2005 and 2007. The city rebuilt the downtown marinas, and in 2011, construction started on the Alamitos Bay Marina, Bellingham Marine. The company completing this major infrastructure project is the global leader in design, manufacturing and construction of marinas. Bellingham Marine enjoys an unrivaled reputation within the industry and has installed more than 20 million square feet of concrete floating docks throughout the world. Reconstruction work has included demolition of existing wooden docks, removal of piles, dredging, installation of new piles, assembly and installation of concrete docks, upgraded utilities at the docks, as well as restroom and parking lot rebuilds. The magnitude of this project has required the Marine Bureau to. Temporarily. Relocate boat owners during reconstruction. Reconstruction includes demolition of existing wooden docks, removal of piles. I think already set those. To date, we have completed basins one, four, five and eight. Basin two is planned to be completed by spring 2016, and Basin three will be completed by December of 2017, followed by Basin six and seven in December 2018. The total estimated cost to rebuild the Alamitos Bay Marina is $110 million. I want to thank John GROSS and Alveda Hannan and Hallinan for working so closely with one another when we earlier this year approved. The. The bond sales. They have done a fantastic job. And I'm so grateful for their their service and their commitment to this project. Thanks to our chief of staff, Julie Maliki, we have a short video that we'd like to show regarding the rebuilding process for Basin four, which is the basin located next to the Long Beach Yacht Club . Instead. You. And of course. This move. Your face. Really? See. Running away. Julie That was awesome. I'm wondering if that song is part of Julie Maliki's playlist. I would have gone with more of a Spanish flare song, but that was good. I liked it. Thank you very much, Julie, and the team that she assembled to put this video together. Honestly, this project is so amazing. The marinas look wonderful. Almost brought me to tears to watch that video. I'm so proud to have that in the city of Long Beach. Boat owners all around the region thank us and are so appreciative for this process. We are way ahead of so many other marinas and still offering these these spaces at a very reasonable cost to to the user. So I am so grateful for that. I'm not sure if there's a staff report. I just kind of took over. But I. Can't remember. I think you covered it very well and we're available to answer questions if needed. Thank you guys very much. This is such a pride for the city of Long Beach. I'm so grateful for your leadership. And Elvira's very balanced. Mechanisms that she uses to make sure that boat owners are treated consistently and fairly. I'm so grateful for that. I think that's a very important attribute to bring to the position. So thank you, Alveda. Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. Is there any member of the public? Well, Councilwoman Price, I'm sorry. I forgot to mention one thing. I would be remiss not to mention that my colleague, council member, Iran is on the Coastal Commission and I thank him for all the approvals that made this project possible because without their support, we would not be able to do these great things with our properties along the coast. So thank you. You can speak on this item. Yes, I was going to. Okay. Thank you. Diana Le Jean. I think it's just really brief. I've seen a figure here of $96 million. Almost. Close to $100 million. Is that what it is? I'm. I'm just sorry. I'm just having such a hard time with that. That amount of money. It's beautiful. I mean, there's no question about it, but I'm having a really hard time understanding $100 million. And yet here we're we I mean, on some boats and a luxury item when people who are sick and and we're we're arguing about you know it will be coming up but I'm just amazed at the amount of money being spent here when we're we're worried about a fairly small amount of money facilitating people who are really , really sick. So I just. Had to say that. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hi. My name's Stephanie Dawson. So I'm a resident of Second District. I'm just struck by the kind of contrast that was created today. We had the chief of the Housing Department talking about a 120 day wait list for applicants, which I will add there is a they have not accepted more people on the waitlist since 2007. As a result of this, we're now subsidizing essentially the cheapest rent in the city of Long Beach by providing $100 million to dredge this and reformat this marina for boat slips that costs $500 a month. So in the era of a fort, when we're in desperate need for affordable housing, when people are losing their homes because they're being priced out of the city of Long Beach. $100 million would go really, really far to developing places where people can actually live. Councilman Price. Thank you. If I could just have staff educate the folks regarding where the money for the marina rebuild came from. I think there's some confusion, miscommunication there. Thank you. Councilmember Vice Mayor. Yes, we'd absolutely like to do that. This is a completely restricted fund. This is the Marina Sub Fund of the Tidelands. This is money collected by boat owners and can only be used for boat owner purposes. It could not be used for any of the other purposes that we would use in the city. So none, no general fund funds were used, no tidelands dollars with the exception of marina funds in the sub funding of the Tidelands Fund. Thank you. I appreciate that.

Brian is here. Come forward, Mr. Carter. We talked about the I mentioned on the last item. The legislation that the county council considered and passed earlier this year. One of the pieces of that was that the council would confirm the executive director of for culture. Upon the recommendation of the board and the county executive. And Mr. Carter is the nominee. I think a number of us, if not all of us, have had the opportunity and privilege to get to meet with you, Mr. Carter, and understand and hear about your impressive background, experience and vision for the Cultural Development Authority. We are excited that you're here today and willing to take on this role at this critical time for our culture. And when we welcome you and give you the opportunity to make some opening remarks, and then maybe we'll have some questions and see what we can do. Sure. I'll just say thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. And pull that microphone right up to you. There we go. I would say that I just welcome the opportunity to talk with you and thank you all for making time over the past three weeks to set up those individual meetings. It was nice to be able to chat a little bit more informally and hear about what some of your concerns are and also opportunities for our partnership to strengthen as we move forward. So I'll just say I'm very, very fortunate that the search committee and the board selected me to be the next executive director for culture. The legacy of that organization over the past decades and decades here in King County has been really tremendous. And as somebody who's worked in arts and culture and heritage and preservation for years and years now, it's really such an honor to take the helm of this prestigious agency. And I look forward to doing good work. And I'll just look forward to doing that work in concert and in collaboration with you. And as we discussed individually, I think lines of communication being open when there are questions that we're there to answer them and that we work collaboratively to ensure the cultural health of the entire county is as high and as a stable as it can possibly be. So I look forward to that work with you and also with the folks sitting in the audience and the larger cultural community here in King County. I think it's exciting times and I look forward to being in the mix of those exciting times. So thank you. Thank you very much. Councilmember Gossett, would you like to lead this off? Yes, I think it would be helpful for the audience here and our broader listening audience on TV, sir, to hear something about what work you've been doing for our culture and some of your previous experience. I think it would be unlikely, I'm sure. As with that. I've been working in culture within museums for the past 15 years before I came to Fort Culture. So I had the fortune of being one of the founding staff members at the Northwest African-American Museum, where I served as deputy director and head curator for about nine years. After that, I had the fortune to be on. What years were those pieces? God, when I. Start the. 2003 2004 to 2012. So it was it was an honor. That was something that I know the region needed and was very proud to be part of its creation and to see it flourish today and receive funding. That's a it's a good day for me for that reason. After that, I moved to Portland, where I was the museum director of the Oregon Historical Society, which is the de facto State History Museum in Oregon. After that, I moved back to Seattle, where I worked at the Burke Museum as a director of interpretation, and then I moved to Fort Culture, where I've served in the for the past almost three years as Heritage Lead. So overseeing the Heritage Program, grant funding, professional development, technical assistance to the field and just trying to be of service to a lot of different heritage organizations, history, museums, independent historians around the county. Or not nationally. Nationally, I serve as the board president of the Association of African American Museums. I also serve on the American Alliance of Museums Diversity Inclusion, Accessibility Task Force. And I'm the father of two sons. And I think that's probably the most important job I have. Thank you, sir. Mm hmm. Thank you. Councilmember McDermott and then Councilmember Bell. DG. Oh, I'm sorry. And Councilmember Cole. Wells on this. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Good afternoon, Mr. Card. Afternoon. I'm interested in coming from within the organization itself. What you think some of the strongest assets for foreign culture are going forward? I think. Me, definitely. Oh. Oh, I bet these jobs do take confidence. Thank you much. Thank you. Okay. No further questions. No further questions. I think that the team that I get the chance to work with and have over the past three years is the greatest asset of the organization. I think it's everybody knows it's been a real moment of transition for for culture. As the previous executive director, long tenured executive director has stepped down and retired, there has been significant changes in senior leadership over the past three years, but consistent in all of that is the staff. I think it's a staff with experience in every facet and discipline of arts, culture, public art, preservation, heritage that you could ask for . It's people who know what they're doing. It's people who have been in the trenches and people who make a firm commitment to for culture. I've never worked anywhere where people just stick in the way that they do because the work is so rewarding. The environment, I think, is so positive, and I think it's a testament to those that came before me. And if I could, just for the public record, I'd love to just say a thank you to Deb Swirsky, who has served as the number two. And deputy director. Nick. There have been a few bumps and hurdles in the recent past, and the staff really look to her as a guiding force and as a solid team mate who was always there for us and for the organization. So I look forward to my continued role collaborating with her and just a thank you from me personally and I think from the board at Port Colter and from the staff of Port Culture. So thank you for that. Companies are increasingly. Concerned about duty and then cold wallets. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just want to say a few words about the process, and I'm sure Councilmember Caldwell's and Councilmember Gossett can as well. There is a very thoughtful, thorough process followed by the Ford Culture Board and the hiring committee. The staff was involved. There was some thinking and rethinking around inclusiveness and diversity in the mission of the organization and how this hire needed to really reflect that. The hiring process needed to really reflect that. The three of us who were council liaisons to the board were invited and included in the the same process as the executive committee. We all had some nice lunches together, meeting with all the candidates. The pool of candidates was solid and we had three outstanding finalists. And I thought that the the results are very, very encouraging. My own personal opinion that Brian is going to be an outstanding executive director for for culture, which is only had one, I mean , is a real inflection point for an organization to go from your founding and very, very influential and in sort of personally charismatic executive director to number two. Right. That's a tough space to step into, but it's also an opportunity. And I think that Brian is absolutely the right person to lead the organization into that next space of opportunity and what our culture will become in the next 25 years. So I just really want to encourage our support of his confirmation and point out that he's a district District six resident, which in no way biases me in his favor. I think we're very, very lucky to have him. Very good. Thank you. His work elsewhere go well. Thank you, Mr. Chair. What Councilmember Bell did. She just said this about what I was going to say. It's been it was it was an incredible process. Not only was there a selection committee and the board, but there was also the executive committee of the board. And it was very systematic, thoughtful, thorough, with a great deal of opportunity for board members to become engaged in what was going on within the process. We had three really excellent finalists. We interviewed them all. They each spent, I believe, a full day with group interviews. Not an easy thing to go through. They all were outstanding. But I have to say, Brian really shone through. And not only has he had tremendous experiences in terms of arts, culture, and I think in your case, Brian, it's heritage, primarily historical preservation heritage, but also the personality that I think will be very appreciated by everybody at Ford Culture who mostly all know him anyway, but also by our council and arts and culture organizations throughout the county. Brian actually came across to me is exceptionally thoughtful, well-spoken, had an eye dia every moment during the interview. I was just captivated by all the ideas he had and I'm very confident that he's going to bring those ideas to action. So I very much commend Brian Carter as executive director. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I also wanted to create to congratulate Brian. I think this is an exciting time for the organization, an exciting time for the county. I really appreciate the time that you and the Board for Culture took during the process when there were three finalists to make yourself available to give council members a chance to get to know you, and then the follow up conversations once you had been selected by me, by the board. I think those conversations are a great start of what will be an ongoing dialog. You're jumping into a tough job, but it's, I think, an exciting one. I think the future in this county is very bright for arts and heritage, and I know my friends in the museum communities are excited to see a heritage a heritage guide, although I know you're equally committed to all all aspects of arts, arts and culture, but that that background that you bring is going to be a particular asset to that element of our cultural preservation. And I just can't say how excited I am and, you know, certainly have my full confidence and look forward to working with you. Thank you. Councilmember Lambert. Thank you. I might just say did all the above, but I wanted to thank you for taking the time for our conversations. And the impressive many things that we talked about were very impressive to me. But your vast experience and balancing heritage is being a really important thing in this county. And the idea that there will be renewed conversations between you and our culture and the council because they all care about making their beauty and art and heritage all across this county. So I'm excited about that and I look forward to working with you also. Thank you. Okay. So let me say before you both question. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Councilmember Cole Wells, you are a co-sponsor of this item and I'm vice chair and very interested in these issues as you would you like to put the item? I think you might want to put it before I. Say to you. And I never seen anybody move faster. One councilman, whether you wanted to hold on the minutes one time. So that way that I moved. I proposed motion 2018 0333 to confirm Brian Carter as executive director of the King County Cultural Development Authority. Thank you. Councilmember Coe Wells I want to let you know, Brian, that it's not very often that legislation comes before us with seven co-sponsors from among the council's members. And that's where your nomination stands today. And that is a sign of a broad support. And so congratulations on that. I think we've had all the comments on this. I looking forward to working with you as well, and particularly on the issues we talked about with respect to small organization support ethnic and racial and cultural diversity, investment, which for culture has really been doing significant work in in the last well throughout its time. But importantly and increasingly in the recent times and also on the geographic balance and investment in developing culture, using the cultural development authority to develop culture in areas where there are cultural and historic deficits, if you will, or desert. So I'm based on our conversation and comfortable and confident that you understand those issues, have a passion for addressing them. And I'm looking forward to seeing that work continue. So thank you for your willingness to serve. Mark. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Councilmember Ritchie. Councilmember Dunn. Councilmember Gossett. Councilmember Colwell. Councilmember Lambert, I. Councilmember McDermott. Oh. Council member of the Grove. We can all hope, Joe. We. Mr. Chair. Hi, Mr. Chair. The vote is Ada is no knows when excuse. All right. We've given a unanimous do pass recommendation to the confirmation. Let's accelerate that on Monday. And what do members think in this beyond consent? I think we've all done it. Someone wants to pull it off. The cannot put on consent. And so there's no need to return on Monday. But you're welcome to. Thank you for being here very much. And congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. We are making good progress here. We have a consent agenda. And I wonder if, Councilman Lambert, would you. Agree. With that? Okay. Councilman recalls if we go ahead. Sorry. I was sitting in the. Chairs like, oh, yeah, I'm. Thrown off because usually customer calls is next to me, my vice chair. So here I am, like. All right, I'll let you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.

The rezoning will allow for more varied uses on the site, including multi residential buildings, commercial uses, art studios, bed and breakfast, things that are allowed under use overlay three when a property is designated, but Brandon can give you more. So more details on the rezoning proposal. As you know, in order for a property to be designated, it must meet the following criteria be more than 30 years of age or of exceptional importance. As the structure was built in 1898, it is 123 years old. It meets that criteria. It needs to meet at least three out of ten significance criteria, maintain integrity and be considered by the Landmark Preservation Commission for its relation to a historic context. This application meets all of the designation criteria and it also meets three significant significance criteria that you see highlighted on the screen criteria B, C and F, which will go over now. So the property has direct and substantial association with two prominent families. First, with multiple generations of the heart family. And second, in the court family, both of whom are recognized persons who had influence on Denver and Colorado society. These earliest residents lived in the house from its construction in 1898 until 1915. The Hart family built the home and three generations resided there from 1898 to 1909. Charles and Elizabeth Hart and their son Richard, along with his family, Elizabeth and their children, John and Stefan. Together, they influenced society through professional fields of medicine and law, as well as philanthropic contributions. The most well-known Hart family member was Steven Hart, who was born while the family lived at the house. Steven would go on to co-found one of Colorado's largest and most influential law firms, Holland and Hart, and he served in the state legislature . He also became Colorado's first state historic preservation office and his dedication to historic preservation. He was honored by the naming of the Steven H. Hart Research Center at History, Colorado, and the Steven H. Hart Awards, which are typically actually given tonight but were postponed due to Comic-Con and which are given to honor historic preservation accomplishments throughout the state. I'm on the court. Purchased the property from the Harts in 1909 and lived there with this with her husband, Peter McCourt, until her death in 1920 1912. Peter continued to live there until 1915 when the property was sold and then the court was known as an excellent businesswoman and well-respected socialite who aided many impoverished individuals and families. She is also acknowledged for her leadership and entrepreneurial spirit that drove her interest and significant involvement in the management of Denver's Broadway and Tabor Grand Opera House theaters, which her second husband, Peter McCourt, was also involved in. He was the brother of the infamous Baby Doe, Taylor Tabor, and the second who was the second wife of Silver King Horace Tabor. Peter McCourt was best known as the prominent theater manager of the world famous Tabor Grand Opera House and the Broadway Theater in Denver. He became one of the most successful theater managers in the country and grew the performing arts in Denver at the turn of the 20th century. He devised the well-known and long lasting silver circuit that booked performing acts across the city cities in Denver, in Colorado, as well as the West and the Northwest. And during the time when the McCourts reside and owned in the property, Peter was expanding the circuit. Due to its association with multiple recognized persons who had influence on society. The property meets criterion be. Both the primary and the accessory structures embody the distinctive visible characteristics of the classical revival or neoclassical architectural style, which was popular in the US from 1895 through the 1950s. The primary structure was constructed in 1898, designed by Denver architects Varian and Sterner. The classical revival style is distinguished from other contemporary revival styles of the time by its use of symmetrical facades, with central entries for height porches supported by classical columns and the use of classical details such as broken pediment, dental cornices and balustrades. The primary structure exemplifies the classical revival style with its dramatic front porch, which dominates the front facade. These are supported by a period iconic columns, along with a decorative balustrade on the second level. The overhanging eaves feature dental courses and frieze bend underneath the cornice. A site edition carries many of these character defining features, including the balance, strike corners and dental courses. The 1911 Carriage House was designed by Denver firm Stirner and Williamson, Stringer's subsequent architectural firm, and also exemplifies the classical revival style and its design elements. And finally, the property is also significant as an established and familiar feature of the Capitol Hill neighborhood due to its prominent location and physical characteristics. It represents over 120 years of Capitol Hill, Capitol Hill history and evolution. Additionally, its prominent location facing onto and elevated above East Eighth Avenue, coupled with its sizable massing scale and architectural features , makes it a familiar and orienting feature of the neighborhood. It is the oldest surviving structure on the block between eighth and ninth Avenues and Pearl on Pennsylvania streets. Over time, most single unit structures and properties were replaced by tall multi-unit structures, which primarily now surround 55 East Eighth Avenue. The exception is the property directly to the north and south on East Avenue and across from the Hartford courthouse, which are also known for landmarks. In addition to meeting the three criteria, the property retains integrity. It remains in its original location. There have been some exterior alterations, but they are sensitive to the original design materials and workmanship as well as the feeling and association of the property. The west and north are rear additions in the porch and closure to the primary structure, which was made in 1929, are compatible with the building's character and do not negatively impact the building's integrity. The addition of the retaining wall and parking lot to impact the setting and feeling, but do not detract from the essential features of the primary structure and carriage house. Overall, the property retains good integrity. The period of significance for this is 1898, the year of construction to 1950. It is it involves the construction of the house, the addition of the carriage house and the years of the heart and the court families resided at the address. The property relates to the context of Denver's recovery and expansion. Following the panic of 1893. Due to the silver crash, Denver experienced an immediate economic downturn that lasted several years and never negatively impacted the city. While many of Capitol Hill's wealthy families were left penniless after the silver panic, this was not the case for the Hart family, whose financial and social status survived due to their careers in medicine and law. And and Peter McCourt, who owned the property next after the city had recovered from the economic downturn. Their six years of ownership fell during a time of continued growth through Denver's economic diversification. And so it is relates to the economic growth of Denver in the early 1900s. And the ABC found that it related to a historic context. In summary, the property meets all the criteria for designation. It's more than 30 years old, meets three designation criteria b, c, an F maintains its integrity and the LPC found that it related to historic context. Two individuals submitted emails in support of the designation and none in opposition. And so the Preservation Commission unanimously recommended approval of the designation application on December seven. Therefore, staff recommends approval for the designation of five, five, five East Eighth Avenue as a structure for preservation. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. All right. Thank you very much, Kara. And council this evening has not received any written testimony on Council Bill 21 1526.

And I that I live at one, three, three Evergreen Road in Gilpin County. I'm the owner of 555 East Eighth Avenue. I'm also 76 years old, and I love this building. It's a beautiful building of I hope to care for for many years, and it. Certainly deserves. A landmark designation. I request the Council vote for approval bill. 20 1-1526 for landmark designation for 555 East Eighth Avenue. Thank you. Thank you. Our next speaker this evening is Bruce O'Donnell. Hello, Madam President, and members of the council. This is Bruce O'Donnell at 386 Emmerson Street in Denver. And Karen Christianson, who just spoke, who's the owner of Phi Phi Phi, the State Avenue. And I started on this project a couple of years ago, and I'm involved primarily in the rezoning of the property, which is, as Cara from Landmark's put it, is kind of a companion piece of legislation. And it's necessary that the rezoning and the landmark designation be considered in unison. And so I'm requesting that City Council vote to approve the landmark designation for Phi Phi Phi V State Avenue this evening. And I'm available to answer questions. Should you have any? Thank you. Thank you, Bruce. Our next speaker is Annie Levinsky. Good evening, members of City Council. I'm Annie Levinsky. I'm the executive director of Historic Denver, located at 1420 Ogden Street in Denver. And we're here to offer our support for this designation. And I particularly want to start with our expression of gratitude to Mr. Christiansen for taking this on. We met with her first a couple of years ago when she was just thinking about this and wanting to make sure that the house had or that the structure had expanded uses continue to serve the community. And she's gone on to work with Mr. O'Donnell and others to prepare the application. So we really appreciate those efforts. Obviously, the home has significant ties to people in Colorado history and great architecture. And Karen went through all of those details. So I'll just add the other comment around how this is a great example of how our structures can be adapted to meet contemporary current community needs. So we see this home now positioned to be a multifamily dwelling complex and have the flexibility to change again over time. So we just are really pleased to see that happening and appreciate your support for this designation as well as the rezoning. Thank you. Thank you, Annie. And I have to say, I think you're the first speaker that we've had tilted in our Zoom platform, so congratulations. You're the first one that way. Our final speaker on this hearing is Jesse Paris this evening. Go ahead, please, Jesse. Counsel. May I be heard? Yes, go ahead. The pairs represent for Blackstone Maximo for self-defense as the Mexican man for social change, as well as the Unity Party of Colorado and for a long black nose along with the East Denver Residence Council. And I'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023. I'm in favor of this preservation tonight. For all the reasons that have already been discussed, it meets all the criteria. It's a historical site. It needs to be preserved. And I support preservation of many of Denver Oracle sites. So I support this one as well. I'm very thrilled and happy to hear that this might be a more time family dwelling. Let's hope that it's an affordable reasonably. We do have a housing crisis. So I'm in full support of this. My thank you. Thank you. That concludes our speakers questions from members of Council on Council Bill 21, Dash 1526. The public hearing is closed. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 21, Dash 1526 Council Member Hines Thank you. Council President I am really excited to see this be up for consideration as a historic for historic designation. I've been I've gone by this, this home lots of times in my trips down to Trader Joe's and and some of the restaurants, the banana restaurants that have also been considered for historic work. Some people have suggested they should be considered for historic preservation. This this is a this is a gem. It's a really it's it's such a beautiful place. And I just want to mention one other thing. So I would encourage my colleagues support of the historic designation. And we'll talk about the rezoning here in a second. But but there are letters of support from neighboring neighboring establishments. There are letters of support from registered neighborhood organizations. And in fact, the neighborhood organizations were strongly encouraging this historic designation just because it's such a gem. So I want to thank the applicant for being willing to to consider historic designation and and for also specifically for moving these two public hearings together, because I think that really helped the surrounding community feel at ease that that it would be designated as well as as have the rezoning. So I encourage support from my colleagues, support from my colleagues. And I will certainly be voting. Yes. Thank you. Council President. Thank you, Councilmember Hines, and I am happy to support this tonight. I think Kara and team did a great job. No opposition to something of this matter.

Item 22 Communication from Councilwoman Price Councilmember Peers Recommendation to direct the City Manager to work with economic development and public works to assess the feasibility of funding an electric electric shuttle service or Free Ride program to transport people from Belmont Shore to Second and PCH into Los Alamitos Bay Landing. Thank you, Councilman Price. Thank you. I'm glad to be bringing this item tonight before my colleagues and I ask for your support. East Long Beach has been seeing major investments in business and as a result, we are anticipating major increases in visitors coming to the area to enjoy the businesses and the beautiful corners of the city. Recently, we have seen Ballast Point become a major draw as a brewery and restaurants, bringing more people to Alba Alamitos Bay landing in addition to the existing businesses in the landing like boat house on the bay. We are also seeing San Pedro Fish Market coming to this area in September, which is a huge regional draw that will add to the activity of the crab pot and sooner or later. Not to mention the second PCH project is coming online in October of 2019. So for all of these reasons, it's essential that we develop some creative ways of better managing the movements of people who want to spend time there and transfer to the Belmont Shore and Naples business corridors. All of these areas are constrained by parking and traffic impacts. So what we can do as a city to make it easier to move people through these areas is essential for us to consider and explore. We saw the successful use of the free rides in downtown and we have seen the first Fridays shuttle work well. So looking forward to applying a similar success to other parts of the city, including East Long Beach. So I thank you for your support. And this item formally requests that our economic development team start to explore and hold stakeholder meetings to determine the feasibility of this program. Thank you. Thank you. There's a motion and a second is your public comment on this. CNN members, please cast your votes. This is very needed.

The committee recommends the passage of Council Bill 11862 regarding the extension of a current one year pilot program agreement between the Department of Parks and Recreation and DBA Services. That is the nonprofit entity of the Downtown Sale Association. This is a three month extension to continue the activation of the downtown parks while they negotiate a five year agreement to continue activities and programs. This has been a one year pilot agreement, which was launched in May 2015 between DSA and the Metropolitan Improvement District, and they have activated and been managing Westlake Park and Occidentale Square. The new amenities include furniture, Ping-Pong, foosball, reading rooms and enhanced plantings, as well as yoga classes, street musicians, ping pong tournaments and kids activities. I should note that it's been pretty successful in that they have daily ambassadors 24 seven staffing and nighttime security. This was following a formal RFP process. DSA in mid the Metropolitan Improvement District has been identified as the partner with which to enter into a five year agreement with activation of these same parks, parks and Recreation, DSA and MID require more time to complete negotiations for this agreement that remains within the term of the pilot agreement, which expires April 30th, 2016.

Well, they could sell the properties that aren't making money. But then they risk housing prices going down, potentially even rent going down. That doesn't seem like a good option. That'll lose money. Well, some of these properties are really cheap to hold on to and maintain. And some of these other ones command a higher rent than they are costing the landlord. They could use these higher rent properties to pay the cheaper properties, property taxes, and just leave it empty. Putting it on the market would make them lose more money than they make by holding on to it. If they want to make sure they make as much money as possible, it is in their best interest to leave that property empty. Allegedly this exact thing is happening in New York City right now due to the COVID exodus. Landlords have realized that instead of lowering rent on all of their properties, they can lower it on a handful of them and still cover their costs. There are empty apartments all over the city while people sleep on the streets. Now some people will see this and think, Well, those landlords are good people. But not all landlords are bad people. To that, I posed this question. If we were in the middle of a water crisis and people were dying of dehydration and a person who happened to buy a couple of different wells before the crisis was selling access to their extra wells at market rate. Would you consider that person a good person? I would call that profiteering. And even grocery stores decided to stop to put a stop to that kind of behavior during the toilet paper shortage of the pandemic. Why can King Soopers see that this behavior needed to be regulated?

Next item. Please report from City Manager Recommendation to execute a contract with Dentons US. For Federal Legislation Legislative Representation Services in an annual amount not to exceed $138,000 citywide. Mr. West. Diana Tang will present this exciting report. We have a new lobbyist. Mayor, members of the City Council. We are pleased to be bringing to you Dentons as the firm that staff is recommending for our Federal Legislative Advocacy Services in DC. Staff issued a request for proposals in. December. 2015 and evaluated five firms. We chose Dentons based. On their qualifications and costs for. Services. Dentons is the largest law firm in the world, and John Russell has put together a strong bipartisan. Team to advance. The city's legislative agenda. John and his colleague Derry Saga is here tonight with us, and I would like to invite them to say a few words. Well, good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council, it's a pleasure to be with you here tonight, not the least of which, because there's no ice and snow on the ground, which we left yesterday. We stand before you representing a core team of 25, 25 advocates in Washington and a team of 125 to participate in the public policy and regulation practice at Dentons. All stand ready and willing to serve you. More importantly, all are excited to serve you. We know that our job means our clients are the city's citizens. And we humbly accept that mantle. Very. Thank you. Hi. Excuse me. I'm Darry Sragow. I don't live in Washington and I don't lobby. I'm the managing partner of the Los Angeles Office of Demos, which, as you heard, is the largest law firm in the world. And I spent much of my life running political campaigns in California. I met a gentleman by the name of Alan Lowenthal in his in his campaign headquarters in 1998, when he aspired to be a member of the state legislature and worked very extensively around the state, used to work in the U.S. Senate. And my role here will primarily. Be to be the. Person you can reach on California time on the ground locally while John Labor is in Washington DC with the team as you. Heard of a couple of dozen lobbyists to take care. Of your needs in in the nation's capital. Long Beach has a story to tell. It has money to ask. For to help. With the funding needs of the city. John and I have been sitting through the entire council meeting hearing about those needs, and we are honored and pleased to have been chosen. Long Beach is a place that is very. Intriguing to us, very frankly, to. Carry your banner in Washington. And we look forward to being helpful to you. So thank you. Thank you. I'm a conservative, Councilman Richardson. Thank you, Mayor Garcia. And please go ahead, you guys grab a seat. Thank you very much. So so again, thank you. I want to thank staff Diana Ting for really making sure that the federal pledge committee was being engaged in this process. You know, I serve as the Fed, the Fed, the chair of our Fed large committee, our federal legislative committee. And I think that our agenda has been I mean, our committee has worked really hard to make sure it's reflective of this sort of dynamic and innovative council and have ideas that come out of this council. I think this is a necessary change to bring on a new firm with the energy and the wherewithal to really keep up with this agenda. Long Beach is a large city and we help drive the national conversation on a number of really important, critical issues from goods movement to climate change, a number of other things. You know, Long Beach's advocacy was important in how we were able to help support dedicated freight, get into the six year transportation bill . We can do that uniquely because we are a port city and we're important. So I think it's important that that we brought these guys in. I'm really excited. I did have a chance to meet John and Dairy just prior to this meeting, and I think they're really excited and they they really have a sense of what our priorities are as a council. I think they're excited to work with us, and that's really important to have a group that really doesn't see us simply as another name on the list, but really an opportunity to really build something special here with us. So again, I'll be voting in support. I encourage my colleagues to vote in support. And welcome to the team. Thank you. Next up is Councilwoman Gonzalez. Sorry, Councilwoman Mongo. Nancy, I skipped the last time I was moving you up. Thank you. I had a great opportunity to meet with our new team today, and I am very excited about the possibilities. I think that they are in tune in understanding what Long Beach needs. I think they are going to be great boots on the ground in DC and advocating for us. I know I spent a good amount of time talking with them about C-17 and the transition and jobs for our community and that that's a priority. Infrastructure, of course, is a priority for our port and ensuring that those one in eight jobs that are here in Long Beach stay in Long Beach. And knowing and understanding what those needs are to make sure that our tax money comes right back here to the great city of Long Beach. So I look forward to working on dynamic and thought changing legislation that can really move the dial for us across the country. And I look forward to their ideas and working with the think tanks and so on and so forth and DC, I think that'll really step us ahead of the game in terms of the next allocation of funding and where we're going with that. So thank you for your ideas. Thank you for your input and I really appreciate that. We're going to be working with you. Councilwoman Gonzalez. Q And as the third member of the Federal Legislative Committee, I also encourage support from my council members to vote in favor of this. I think it's it's wonderful a change of pace for us as we've gone to meetings in D.C. and talked about many of our priorities, which are very important. I know I've often encouraged my council members to my colleagues here to think about the west side of the city and Shoemaker Bridge. And I know Diana has been wonderful at help and helping push that. In terms of transportation, we've gone to the Department of Transportation and talked about that in length. And so I look forward to working with you. I really do. And I know we'll be meeting soon as well. Appreciate it. Thank you. Any other public comment? Hi. On this issue on the on the on this contract. Right. Or is it just a general public comment? Yeah. It's, uh. If it's okay, if it's if it's general, we're going to have it at the end of the meeting. There'll be general public comment. If it's on this item, you can you can come now. Oh, good. Thank you. I'm going over. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Good. You. This has to be, I think, the single most intelligent thing that this council is having at this council has ever had before it. And I fully support it. I'd like to suggest you amend the motion. To point out and to ensure that there will be a correlative elimination of any travel. To Washington by any council person. But but there will be a correlative allowance for increased in Skyping period. These people. And I haven't worked with them before. But in the previous lobbyists we've had, they've been very effective and the last thing they need is some political hack coming a trailing along on a route on a political junket period. So to show the good faith. What you should do is amend the motion. That each of you pledged. Never, ever to use taxpayer money to go to Washington. And. Skype. All you want. Period.

Oh, I'm sorry. Councilwoman. Thank you. Mary, I just wanted to ask, are there any grants that staff has looked into that help achieve sustainability, waste reduction and climate change goals? Specifically, are we working with Cal Recycle or any other organizations in expanding recycling to our beaches and parks? So, yes, good evening, Mayor and members of the Council. There are a number of grants that we have recently and our have in the past applied for. So just this month, we submitted an application to the California Natural Resources Agency for their Urban Greening Grant program that focuses on building a healthier, sustainable California by funding projects that demonstrate. GHG emission reductions by planting. Trees and to sequester and store carbon reducing excuse me, commute vehicle miles by constructing bicycle paths and things like that. So we submitted two concept proposals, one for reforesting various parks and creating a nursery at Willow Springs Park, and then for our 14th Street Park plan, which would reclaim pedestrian right away from traffic and add trees and landscape to various park segments. We are also submitting an application to the State Coastal Conservancy for their Prop one water bond grant for the duck pond restoration at El Dorado West. And then the city has received in the past cal recycle grant funds for other departments such as Public Works Projects, Environmental Services Bureau for the Local Government Waste Tire Amnesty Grant Program. We've received used oil payment program funding and beverage container and recycling payment program. We've also received a number of grants to the California State Parks and Natural Resources Agency, including Willow Springs, Wetlands, Urban Greening Grant and the Forest Wetlands River Parkways Grant. So we are always looking and working with our sustainability folks on different opportunities. There is a citywide grant committee that meets once a month where we look at what other resources might be available to us and has a citywide process looking at what is the best proposal to put forward. So we are as we see those opportunities and are aware of those funding processes, we're in the middle of some we've received some funding in the past and will continue to look at those.

Recommendation to resume final report at the at the April 15, 2014 Council meeting for the next steps on the rebuild of Basins two and three. An Albino Spey Marina. Mr. Long. Let's hear the report. Okay. Mr. West. By vice mayor councilmembers. About 30 days ago, Councilmember DeLong and Councilmember Lowenthal brought forward this item to talk about how we can speed up the elevated Alamitos Bay Marina rebuild. We are running out of money looking for some bond issues and things like that. So the council directed us to go back, sharpen our pencils and come back. We're doing that tonight. I do want to make a comment that through the efforts of Councilmember O'Donnell, it does help to have an oral history here. He was working as a city employee back in the early nineties, late eighties, and recalled that while the Titans fund wasn't doing so well back then, a certain amount of marina funds went to the Tidelands area that wasn't repaid. So we looked at that. The council directed us to look at that. And sure enough, we found about $10.9 million from back in the early nineties that went to Tidelands because again, Tidelands was broke at that time and wasn't repaid. So with that direction of the council, we're looking at that $10.9 million to help jumpstart this project. And I want to turn this over to our Parks Recreation and Marine Director George Champion to walk us through the time schedule and where we're at. Thank you, Mr. West. Thank you, council members. We are going to wait for the PowerPoint to appear on the screen. So just a slight technical difficulty. Vice mayor, vice mayor and members of the city council. So with this presentation tonight, I'll talk about the history of the rebuild in Long Beach marinas, all three of them, the completed phases of the Alamitos Bay. Rebuild the remaining phases of the Army's Bay rebuild. And recommendations on moving forward with the remaining phases, including funding options, which I will turn over to Director of Financial Management John GROSS when I'm finished with my presentation. As you know, Long Beach has three marinas Shoreline, Rainbow and Alamitos, built in the 1950s and sixties. Those three marinas have a combined slip count of 3677 with 2095 of those slips in Alamitos Bay. The marinas were built in the 1950s and sixties, so they have either exceeded their useful lifespan or very near the end of their lifespan. Back in 1995, the City Council authorized state loans, state loan applications for the revitalization of the city's marinas. However, due to state budget shortfalls over the years, only portions were approved by the state. The state approved $32 million for Shoreline and 34.1 million for them. East Bay Marina, Shoreline and Rainbow marinas were built with concrete docks by Shore Master LLC, who, by the way, also bid on the Alamitos Bay Rebuild Project, but was was not the lowest bidder. The rebuild started in 2005 and was completed in 2007. The total cost was $37 million for the Shoreline and rainbow marinas. At that time, however, construction at shoreline included only docks using existing piles, pilings wherever. Whereas Alamitos Bay has a broader scope, including dredging, pile removal, installation, seawall repair, etc. etc. Again, Shoreline Marina was just docks. It's an important distinction when comparing shoreline to the Animas Bay rebuild. To look at the history of the rebuild for the Army's big project. We pulled all the council reports dating back to December 25. There were some there were some reports prior to that. But I think for our purposes, 2005 was sufficient. Since 2005, 12. Parks. Recreation and Marine Action items have come before the City Council regarding the Alamitos Bay rebuild. Of those 12, ten were very specific about the project needing to be phased due to lack of funding for the entire rebuild project. Looking at the history of the ABM rebuild, it was clear from the beginning that the city didn't have enough money to do the entire rebuild at one time. It was recognized early on that that this rebuild, if it was to be done, would be built in phases or on a pay as you go basis, if you will . This was again emphasized by the city auditor in a public presentation before the City Council on August I'm sorry, April 212, 2011, recognizing that this project had to be phased. The Parks Recreation Marine Department has worked with financial management in every phase of this rebuild to assess the financial condition of the bureau, the state loans and the viability of the next steps to today. Four of the eight basins have been completed since 2002, with most of the work being completed more recently. As you can see from this, these are the four basins that were completed Basin eight, basin four, basin one and Basin five as of April 14, as of April 2014. These are the basins that have been completed. Sure. Again, was strictly replacement of docs and nothing more. No piles were replaced, no dredging done. Just replacement of docs. Allow me to say by comparison was much greater in scope and much more complex. It included new piles, gangways docks, seawall repair, void, grouting under seawalls, new utilities and disposal of disposable silt. Work in basin for also included landside improvements such as ADA compliant restrooms, landscaping and parking lot. So given the additional cost for the landside work base and for we made a decision at that time that we would not do any more landside work in the immediate future so that we can concentrate our dollars towards completing the docks for the remaining basins we'd say the landside work for after all, the waterside was completed. The audit scope, the scope of the work for for the elements to be rebuilt was extensive compared to Shoreline, but the scope was even further expanded by requirements imposed on the project by the Coastal Commission when the city submitted the project for their approval. Coastal added these additional requirements to the project. These were not part of the original cost estimates for the project. So back in 2008, when gave the cost estimates. These were considered as part of the cost estimates. The scope of, as you can see, includes eelgrass mitigation, insulet, pump outs, biological monitoring, drive, boat storage. Again this is coastal is attempt to keep boating affordable for people because of the changes in the boating industry. More and more people are moving away from the small boats, so Coastal wants to make sure those are available. Drive boat storage is available for the smaller boats, recycling away stations, post displacement allowances. Again, these were unique to the army as they rebuild, not so much to the shoreline rebuild. The funding sources for the four basins that were completed, as you can see. State loans, a combination of state loans and marina fund for a total of $48 million. So we have the remaining phases for the elements. Bay Rebuild our base in two base, in three base and six in base and seven with the number of slips in those basins. In addition, Coastal does require us to build a dry boat storage for the small boats. As we indicated, the cost by category Bellingham Marine Industries, that's $52 million for the docks. These prices right now are, as of today, assuming there are no other delays. The projects for all four basins and the dry boat storage would come in at $60 million. Contingency is about 5% of Bemis cost. The water quality monitoring during dredging has to be done by federal requirements. The construction management the city uses trans systems is our construction manager. This contract with Trans Systems was approved by the City Council back in 2005th December 2005, and their scope of services were pre-construction, construction and post-construction work. This number represents construction services such as coordination of all project participants, developing construction schedules, monitoring the design and construction process to ensure completion within scope and stormwater permitting. Our recommendation for the priority of the remaining basins would be as follows Basin to basin three, six, seven and the dry boat storage. If we were to do all this work at one time, the first order of business would be to complete the Southern California Edison and Utility Backbone four Basin two and three. And this item will be next on tonight's agenda for your approval if you wish to approve that project. Dock word and dock work and dredging needs to be done in Basin two and that's critical at low tide clears in some areas is only three feet an industry standard for size for the size vessels in that basin is eight feet at minimum. And again, dry boat storage requirements. And that's a California coastal requirement. Dredging. We do have a ocean disposal permit that allows us to dispose of the dredged material up to October 2015. After that date, the city will work with the Port of Long Beach towards disposal solutions in the Middle Harbor Phase three project . That concludes my presentation. I'll turn this over to John GROSS to go over the financials. Thank you. And I'm going to cover how we might finance this and how we can finance it. What I'll be talking about is based on work by some expert consultants that finance and the Parks and Recreation Marine Department hired to review the financial status of the Marina Fund and to assess the competitive situation for our slip fees . Based on that review, a projection was done by the consultants of the amount of money that could be borrowed from the Marina Fund. And what I'll be representing tonight is based on that report. Slip fee increases are very important because most of the revenue from the Marina Fund, which pays for the rebuild, that's where the money comes from. Slip fee rate increases dictate how much money is going to be available for the ABM rebuild and how much we can borrow. The options we looked at and our consultants looked at include included going an ongoing 2% slip fee increases combined with various types of other increases, including 3% increases until market levels are reached. And that was looked at because the current slip fee rates are somewhat below the market in this area. However, regardless of the slip fee rates that we use, the marina does not have the ability to support enough debt to finance the remaining ABM. Rebuild costs that we just heard were about $60 million. So let's talk about the borrowing capacity of the marina. The consultants indicated that about 34 to $40 million can likely be borrowed by way of a bond issue, depending on the level of slip fee rate increases. That leaves about 20 to $26 million. That must come from other sources, potentially in phases in order to achieve the current $60 million cost of the remaining waterside parts of the project. The bonds will also take about a year to issue because of the complexities of the financing and the fact that this is a very difficult market in which to sell these bonds. There is a possible role of the Tidelands Fund in solving this funding situation. Tidelands has received about $10.9 million from the marina over a number of years, primarily between 88 and 96. That could be returned. That 10.9 million could be returned to the marina to help solve the funding problem. And as another point, it will take about 2 to 3 months to secure approval from the State Lands Commission, which were required to do for use of tidelands money for the ABM rebuild, if that's what council wishes to do. Overall, and just to wrap things up in terms of the timing and what can be done tonight, we have a request. The next item on the agenda from Parks, Recreation and Marine is to authorize $1.8 million from the Marina Fund, and it has that cash to continue ABM rebuild work. Staff will start immediately a process to engage consultants for a potential bond issue in June or July. This in just a couple of months from now, we expect to be able to secure State Lands Commission approval for use of tidelands funds at that time. $10.9 million of council wishes can be made available from Tidelands for an APM rebuild in addition and work on Basin two can begin with that $10.9 million. Work will then continue on the bond issue and in the first half of 2015, Council could consider authorizing bonds, the slip fee rates and the balance of funding for the project . Bonds could be sold based on those authorizations probably somewhere in April or May of 2015. And then the ABM rebuild could be continued and completed, and that is the end of staff's report. Okay. Thank you. I'm going to move on to council comments. Councilman DeLong. Thank you. You see a couple of things. First of all, you talk about in the existing work that's been done, about $15.8 million has come out of the marina funds to date. Did we receive state lands approval for each of those expenditures? I don't believe so. Those are marine enterprise funds. So they weren't Thailand's per se, but they were marina enterprise funds either. And I apologize. But, you know, sometimes we're told that it's all part of the Thailand fund and other times we're not. So we get conflicting information. Now, if you go with the theory that you've suggested here, that there $10.9 million is really marina funds. It's not Thailand's funds, but it's paid back. Why would you need state lands approval for it? Councilmember The distinction is in part the revenue source where the money comes from. So the marina funds are basically generated out of the marina. Yes. And so the oil revenue is what state lands requires approval of. So whenever we're using oil revenue for any capital project over $100,000, we need state lands approval. But I guess what I heard was that the $10.9 million was originally marina funds. And now all we're doing is we're reimbursing the Marina Fund. Right. But we're reimbursing it with oil revenue. That is for a specific capital project. So we will need state lands and as we've. Indicated, it. Will occur in June. And and I, I don't think we want to put in jeopardy all of the other capital projects that we have in the pipeline by trying to avoid State Lands Commission, because they pay very close attention to what we're doing with the oil revenue. Got it. All right. Help me understand the dredging a little better that we've talked about, that after October 2015 will work at the Port of Long Beach. And I'm sure that port will be as cropped as they can. But what what are the potential pitfalls with that approach? Is it a done deal or are there things that could happen that would prevent that from occurring? Councilmember We've already discussed this with the port and they have told us they've always worked with us, with our dredge material and they told us they'll be there for us at that period of time. No one can promise what's going to be happening at that period of time with measure with them, with their Middle Harbor project. But if they have the ability to take the dredge material, they certainly will. They've started. They've stated. Okay. And the $60 million total cost, how much of that is I guess, and what's the sequence? So we know you're recommending moving forward to face up to another 60 million. How much is associated basin to Councilmember Basin? Two is about $26.9 million. Okay. Got up since yesterday. How about it? And then this Basin three follow that. I don't think it went up since yesterday. It was always 26.9. Basin three is 22.1 million. And then on those costs, I'm sorry. You include all the costs, not just bellingham's. Right. Okay. City manager and I had a conversation yesterday based on sex, and that would be the next one that you would go to. Yes. Okay. And with the cost of. That would be 6.7 million. And based on seven. 1.6 million. And the drydock. That's $572,000. And the landside improvements after all this is done. Well, landside improvements would be a number of restrooms depending on when we do it. And escalation right now, I think, between landscaping and restrooms is about $18 million kind of. All right. If I see a city auditor here missed out every moment. How are you coming? Taking a look at the marina funds versus Thailand, the funds and how they've been used. We're still working on it. We have received all the documents from city staff and we're analyzing all the information. We should be wrapping it up in a couple of weeks and give it back to city management. Great. Okay. Because that could help the bond issues as well as more more funds in the Marina Fund. All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Thank you. That's all the questions I have at the moment. Councilman O'Donnell. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. And I want to say. Just quickly, I appreciate staff's work on this, because basins two and three are definitely in need of work. And I think that's why some of the individuals are down here tonight. They well know as users of the marina that those spaces are absolutely in need. There's planks popping up. There is nails sticking up. It's not really a safe place to walk. And I know staff is doing their best to address those conditions, but ultimately it has to be replaced. So at that, just a couple of questions with the plan. These are just practical questions. But the the plan, we're not going to losing existing public dock space. What I mean is the temporary space when people pull up, etc., not necessarily the permanent folks. No, we wouldn't be losing any dock space. Okay, great. And can you just describe the small the small boat storage requirements are those for the dinghies that pretty much are already in existence on the dock or are they is there a requirement for small boat storage space elsewhere? Actually, they're more for the 20 to 30 foot vessels. The industry is finding that. People are. Trailering those in more than they are putting them in the water. It's cheaper to keep them on. Dry on the dry land. So Coastal is. Requiring that that we build some drive or storage. So that's in addition to the dry storage located right off Marine Stadium. Yes. Really interesting. I actually I see that as a good thing because there does need to be a balance. We want people to vote. We want people in a marina. Not everybody can afford the slip fees because they are going up. I think we need to watch that, too. So with that, I turn it back to you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Thank you, Councilman Neal. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. And in regard to your potential timing, under the June, July, the approval of the 10.9 million of titling funds, is that the only option that we have as a council at this body were not to choose that option? Is there a contingency plan or is this really the only option that we have, I guess is my question. Councilmember The original option was not to utilize tailings funds or general fund and we would go on perhaps a ten month hiatus waiting for the bond issue. So we have no plan B except to wait and wait when the bonds are issued by Mr. GROSS. The 40 the $40 million, we hope then we would kick start the marina, but it wouldn't be for about a year, so we would be taking a pause. But this use of the Tidelands funds allow us to kick us into gear right away. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. City Manager. Thank you, Captain Ballantyne. Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. I wanted to thank the individuals that have come out here tonight. I know you're just a small representation of the larger group of constituents that are interested in this. To start, I do want to thank you for coming up with a financing plan, and I appreciate the timeline for Bass in, too, but really hope that we can get the remainder of the projects done as quickly as possible. In addition to the disrepair. I do think it's such a vital part of our history and the city's identity. I wanted to ask in terms of the timing, Mr. West, you just mentioned what the timing would be, the council's action tonight. How many subsequent actions would you have to come back for in order to ensure that this is on track? And I think you understand my concern here. You have very strong advocates on this council. I would hate for there to have to be a learning curve of sorts, because that would suggest that the community wait even longer . And so to keep this on path in a seamless way as possible, given what our diocese will look like in July. Is this all you need today to keep it on track? Yes. We're not tonight we're not looking for any action from the city council. We were asked to come up with the plan to go forward. This is our plan to utilize the $10.9 million. If there was an objection to that, we would like to hear that tonight. I'm not hearing that. So our plan would be to go to the State Lands Commission in June. I think it's the second or third week of June. Hopefully they will approve this ten point million dollars, 10.9 million to go to basin to. We will come back, I hope, in the first or second meeting in July with the City Council to appropriate the $10.9 million and enter into a contract for basin to. Okay. I appreciate that you don't need an action tonight, but I think you understand my concern. And so while you don't hear an objection, I want to be sure that the point of action is taken as early as possible. This will be. The action from the Council will be the. First or second. Meeting and general. Meeting in July as the first meeting we can get to. After that State Lands Commission meeting in May or June. I'm sorry. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. Any further council comment? Councilmember DeLong And it was along the same side. What I would ask you, Mr. West, is, if at all possible, assuming state lands approves, it is to come back on the first Tuesday in July, the second Tuesday, a difficult meeting with what else is occurring. So that that would be our intention. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you. Seeing no further council comment, do we have a motion on this yet? I believe we moved in second and already didn't. We move to designate problem. So why don't we turn to the public and item number 23? Any members of the public wish to speak on item number 23? Mary, Judy Clarke has to address a number of issues. Number one, if I read the information correctly, part of this money is to pay Bellingham to stand by and wait because their contract apparently is if it was represented right ends and their contract is up. I don't think we should pay anybody to stand by and wait. What we say to them is bye bye. No, no. And if they want to come back, they come back. All right. I think a better way to approach is to move forward and bow out and do the remaining work, which definitely needs to be done and do it in with wood, not the concrete. Varian allowing our good staff to do the repairs that come up at any point in time. They have the capacity we have the capacity to do it here very well locally. It's divorced from intelligence to hire somebody 1600 miles away that's structured into the cost. When you buy a car, do you buy it from somebody or are you the mechanic or you have to take it 1600 miles away? Makes no absolutely no sense. It's void of intelligence. So the city long has the capacity to get it done with wood and the city staff can repair it and do it very well. Parenthetically, I think we do a vote of thanks to Councilman O'Donnell for finding that original can for that institutional memory and finding those funds from the it went from one fund to another. Thank you, Mr. Goodhew. It comes from my Marine patrol days, many years ago. I know where thank you assembly was made, and I think this needs to be understood. The staff had indicated that the tendency is for larger boats. Not so. Not so. The average. The best. What we are. The target market we should have is those around 34. Once you get beyond 34 feet. You have a problem. You can't take it out as often unless you have a full crew. That's why 90% of these boats just sit there. You need the crew to operate that. So our market is in that 34, up to a 34, maybe a 36. Beyond that, they sit there too long. All right. God the only people to tell you otherwise. Who are the brokers who want to move those things? Period. Additionally, I think that we should understand why that small we need small boats is. We are the only place that has the breakwater we have that gives us, in fact a de facto in the lake where George Joe Sixpack can go out and spend the weekend behind the breakwater without going out into the high seas. Thank you, Mr. Good here. Next speaker. Please. My name is John Mrazek. I live at 5381 East Appian Way. Firstly, I would like to thank Councilman de Long for his support in this. I mean, we disagree very often, Councilman de Long, but I do agree with you in this case, and I thank you for your support. I was a little incredulous at the staff's report that there was 10.9 million missing from the Marina Fund, that that we were penalized for going on, what, 18 years now? You know, I don't know how that could have happened. And, you know, to be honest with you, I think we should probably request interest back from the Tidelands funds for our $10.9 million loan amounts are a little incredulous that the work will not be done on the slips and base and two and three except for the electrical work, we hope. And yet the staff is recommending greater than market increases and slip fees to get us to a market position when in fact that we have substandard slips and we have slips that don't deserve that type of slip feet. I also notice that we gave tonight the Long Beach Slope Club a break in their permit fees. Well, if we're sending in substandard slips, I think that the basin two and three should also get a permit or get a break in our slip fees for being in substandard facilities. I'm not going to say my fourth point because it's not politically correct, but I will comment on Mr. Good, his comments. As you know, to be honest with you, Mr. Goodhue, unless you're down at the marina, unless you own a boat, you don't know what you're talking about. You know, I'm I'm not a yacht broker, and I do take my boat out. And I love being on the water. And I can tell you, everybody here loves being on the water and lesser slips. So let's finish the marina. Thank you. Thank you. Male speaker, please. Good evening, and thank you for allowing me to speak briefly. My name is. Richard Winslow, and I live in. Leisure World in your neighbor to the south. But I'm a small stakeholder. I say that without modesty. I have a 38 year old. 33 foot sailboat at Alamitos Bay. I'm on Gangway 17, and it's been receiving quite a bit of recent maintenance. And some of you may know that at least two people have fallen off of or into the dock in Basin two lately and injured themselves. In a minor way, fortunately. But the idea of. Possibly waiting or delaying the beginning of repairs, I think, is not a wise course. You have not. Only an asset to protect that you owe the the city and the county even. But also the. Potential of liability. For people who might get injured as a result of. Deficient dock. We were as careful as we can be when we're walking around. But even with. That, the docks breaking and boards are simply not sufficient. So, you know, I think any delay would be as likely to cost you more in liability. Potential liability for personal injury and possibly for damage to the boats more than you could hope to sail at. To say if by. Delay I would. Echo and had already planned to suggest that asking for $10.9 million from someone who in effect borrowed it 20 years ago is not what you'd expect from a. Bank or anything else. If you borrow something for. 20 or 30 years, you pay back. Three times as much as you borrowed. You're not likely to get two or three times that back from. The Tidelands, but I think at least. Negotiation should begin with trying to get twice as much back or try to find out. What value they got from borrowing that ten and. Almost. $11,000,000.20 or 30 years ago. And what they. Pay back should reflect some of that. And hopefully the the city attorney can advise you on whether that's. You know, it's legal. To require them to pay back something on the investment. Something for borrowing the money. Pretty much. That's all I had to say. Thank you very much. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Hello. My name is Operator Fernandez. I live in. 22 Northumberland Drive now. I mean, this bay and. The part I want to bring up is something new that just. Was brought up to me. Last week. I'm also on the board of directors of the The Measurement Laboratories Association. And is that sailboats with draft deeper than six feet. Are getting stuck in the. Fairway at low tide through tide and below? And actually, they did send me the pictures of a couple of those that are coming in and they're slip at low tide. They're getting stuck as they're coming. Into the fairway or trying to get into the slip. So that's besides the docks falling apart, which they're doing. The main is doing a great job on it. Now we're getting boats that are adding to the danger because they're coming in and then there's either got to call, vessel assist or wait to the higher tide to continue on. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. My name is Bob Hubbard. I'm a resident of the third district. And I have a boat on Gangway 14 and Basin two. I just wanted to encourage anybody on the council or. On the city staff that hasn't. Gone out and walked along some of those docks to do it. I know that it. Seems everybody's in support of doing this rebuild as soon as possible. But it can't be delayed. Those places, those things are dangerous. Just a couple of months ago, there. Was a problem with my slip, and when I reported it to the city maintenance, I was told, okay, well, they'd take my request. I was number. 56 on the list for major maintenance. On a slip. So that they'd get to me in a few months. You know, I know they're doing a good job. They've got limited funds, but they can't keep up on my gangway. There's at least two or three more slips that are in situation like. Mine was a couple of months ago. Mine got so bad that I finally made repeated calls to Marina Maintenance and they they declared it emergency and came out and fixed it somewhat. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's way better than it was. It was sinking. The the finger on the dock was angled such. That you couldn't walk down it. So we can't delay. And if you haven't. Been out there and looked at it, please do. As to concrete. Versus replacing with wood, again. Obviously that I couldn't see that as a viable option. The way the wood is now, it'd be the same way in a shorter period of time than concrete. So anyway, I just encourage everybody to to do everything you can to make this move forward as fast as we can. They're just not safe. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Pardon me, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council. My name is Rick Duryea. I'm the chairman of your Marina Advisory Commission. Once again, you've heard all the impassioned pleas by your tenants, your boat owners, as well as staff and their recommendations on how we move forward with this project. I think it's important that the Marina Advisory Commission go on the record of supporting what has been presented to you tonight. We've met with the Director of Parks, Recreation and Marine and his staff, and we are unanimous in wanting this project to move forward as quickly as possible. We believe that staff has found a viable way to do so. And we urge your support tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Vice Mayor. Council people and staff. My name is Carl Kern Bauer and the past president of the Long Beach Marinas Boat Owners Association. And very impressed like this. Special thanks to Councilman DeLong and Lowenthal for your assistance in helping this all come together and very impressed with the 10.9 million, obviously. And yes, I encourage support and the opportunity to perhaps get some interest on this 30 years of money that have been held, which would be very helpful for getting the rebuild going. But I've been around. I've had my boat. And I don't know how many years I've been in the Long Beach Marinas decades and in the past, I heard perhaps I'm incorrect, but I heard that the DBA, Department of Boating and Waterway funded substantially or perhaps all of our rebuild. I can be wrong on the amount, but a very, very substantial funding of our rebuild that's d ball to parting of waters. And by the way the ball is 100%, from my understanding, funded by us boaters, supposed to be dedicated only for use for boating people. Okay, so like funding the marina. I was wondering if y personally why I did not hear one word from the city manager about d ball and perhaps I'm talking the wrong thing, but shouldn't we be looking at DBL for funding of this marina rebuild as we've done in the past, all that money that goes into the ball comes from us boaters. So thank you for your time. Hopefully we can look into D ball. Thank you. I would like. Thank you. We'd like the finance director to just respond to that. Sure. When I discussed looking for bonds, we will be including looking at DBA as a possible option for the loans or in addition. So that's just automatically included. We agree with the we will look at Devo. Great. Any other statement? No other public comment? Any other counsel comment on the item? We have a motion on the floor, I believe, Mr. Kirk. Yes. So, Members, please go ahead and cast your votes. Motion carries equal access. Great. Thank you and thank you all for coming out again. Next item, please.","Recommendation to receive and file the report provided at the April 15, 2014, City Council meeting regarding the next steps in the rebuild of Basins 2 and 3 in the Alamitos Bay Marina.

Counsel build 22 dash. 246 has passed. Thank you to the community member and the owner and thank you, friend for the staff report. We're going to move on. Councilmember Flynn, would you please put Council Bill 22, Dash 249 on the floor for final passage? Yes, Madam President, I move that council bill 22 dash to 49, be placed upon final consideration and do pass. Thank you. It has been moved and seconded the required public hearing for Council Bill 20 2-2 49 is open now we have the staff report. Council members from Pineville again planning services. No, I'm going to present you an overview for the MAP Amendment four 4151 4155 North Jason Street. The subject property is in Council District one in the Sunnyside neighborhood. And the properties are located in the southwest corner of Jason Street and 42nd Avenue. The properties are currently in the I am x three zone district and the applicant is proposing to rezone to urban residential mixed use five storey district which would allow for townhouse and shopfront building for up to five storeys. The District is intended for the use for using the urban neighborhood context to promote safe, active and pedestrian skill diverse areas and enhance the convenience, ease and enjoyment of transit, walking, shopping and public gathering within and around the city's neighborhood. The Karen Industrial mixed use three storey district allows for a mix of industrial, commercial, residential and civic uses. Adjacent zoning include I am x30x8 you are x3ia year two with other mixed use multi-unit and single units on districts in the vicinity. As far as the existing context, the area's land use is a mix of industrial office and residential uses. Showing the upper right photo. 4155 Jason Street has a warehouse currently on site and in the bottom right photo you can see 4155 Jason Street, that is currently used as surface parking. The image on the bottom left side of the slide shows the townhomes on the other side of the alley west of the subject properties. Now here I included a comparison table where you can see some of the differences and similarities between the carrier and I am x and the requested your x5. A couple of things I would like to note here are that the new request, the new request the district will allow for the shopfront building firm that is not currently allowed in. I am x three and it will allow for five storeys or 70 feet in height compared to the current three stories or 45 feet allowing. Also u r x5 doesn't allow for surface parking between the building and the primary street and requires more transparency on the primary street, which will promote safe, active and pedestrian uses. Concurrent with the rezoning, the applicant is facilitating a voluntary, affordable housing agreement. The agreement will apply to integrity of the site. General terms include a commitment to construct at least 10% of the total units affordable to residents earning 80% or less of the area median income, resulting in seven units under the current proposed development plan of 73 units. 8% of the units would be restricted to 80% AMI, and 2% of the units would be affordable to residents earning 60% AMI. The income restricted units will remain at this level of affordability for a minimum period of 99 years. Throughout the rezoning process, application modifications have been provided according to code requirements. Planning Board recommended approval anonymously in February 16, 2022, and to date received only one letter of support from Sunny, who has been working with developer on a memorandum of understanding. The applicant also provided a summary of the community outreach in the application. Now on to the criteria. There are four approved plans for these two sites. As stated in the staff report, the rezoning is consistent with several goals in the comprehensive plan. Just to name a few. If approved, this rezoning will increase the development of housing units closer to transit and mixed use development. It will promote infill development where infrastructure and services are already in place, and it will also focus growth in transit stations. The proposed rezoning is also consistent with the urban neighborhood context as defined in Blueprint Denver. The proposed U. R. S five district is intended to promote safe, active and pedestrian scale diverse areas through the use of building forms that clearly define and activate the public realm. The future places map designates the subject properties as high medium residential areas. Blueprint Denver describes these areas as having a mix of mid-scale multi-unit residential options. Some neighborhoods serving mixed use might be appropriate. Buildings are generally up to five storeys in height as proposed on district. You are five allows for a range of residential and limited commercial uses along on designated local streets, and this area is well-served by transit. This makes the district consistent with the future streetscape at this location. The growth area in Denver is all other areas of the city. These areas are anticipated to see a 10% employment growth and a 20% housing growth by 2040. Now looking at the 41st and Fox station area plan. This plan was adopted by City Council in 2009 and applies to subject properties. The plan sets for a vision for the creation of a diverse transit, sportive and environmentally sustainable urban center in the land use concept map. Subject properties are mapped urban residential to eight stories. These areas are intended as new moderate density neighborhoods and are intended to create an improved new edge between the station and the existing neighborhood to the west. The Urban Residential two stories designation calls for a range of housing types, including single unit accessory dwelling units, duplex townhouses and small condominium and apartment buildings. The requested zone district you are five, allows for a wide range of housing types and provides an opportunity for neighborhoods serving commercial uses within walking distance of the transit station . Therefore, this rezoning request is consistent with both the land use and building heights recommendation in the 41st and Fox station area plan. Now. The Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan was adopted in 1992 and also applies to subject properties. The plan identifies the subject properties as industrial, but they are right on the edge of what is described as a residential area to the west. Although the Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan is an adopted plan that contributes to policy and development of decisions within the neighborhood, the eastern portion of the plan area, including the subject sites, has more recent guidance from the 41st and Fox station area plan. The station area plan is more recent. It provides more recent land use recommendations and the older Sunnyside Neighborhood Plan. Still, the proposed zone district you are five is consistent with the overall goals of the plan. It supports housing options and the opportunity for a limited neighborhood serving commercial uses. Stuff also finds the requested zoning meets the next two criteria. It will result in the uniform application of this on district building, form, use and design regulations on these sites as they are applied in any other sites. You are. And the proposed amendment furthers a public health, safety and general welfare of the city by implementing the vision set forth in the city. Adopted plans. By allowing. By allowing high medium intensity mix of land uses and intensity redevelopment that is in character with the surrounding neighborhood. The application identified several changes and changed conditions that justified circumstance, risk and physical. Recent physical changes within close proximity to subject sites include the opening of the 41st and Fox Station in 2019 and the addition of the multi-use industry that connects the Sunnyside neighborhood to downtown. There are also several new predominantly residential projects in the immediate area, including townhomes across the alley from the subject property. The site development on the street and the new project under construction across adjacent street. Rezoning to a district that allows for ground floor retail will be necessary to provide neighborhood serving uses for new and existing residents in the area. Overall, the proposed rezoning is consistent with the urban neighborhood context, the mixed use, residential district purpose and intent. Therefore, it stuff recommends approval based on finding all you get. Criteria has been met. All right. Thank you, Fran. We have two individuals signed up to speak this evening. Our first speaker is Bobby Brown. Just drastic? Thank you, Madam President. I'm Bobby Vandross. I live in the neighborhood. I'm here representing Sunnyside, United Neighbors, Inc.. We want to urge the council to support this bill tonight. We've met with the developers on multiple occasions over several months and have developed a memorandum of understanding with them that incorporated multiple tasks from the community into the site development plan and the zoning changes consistent with Blueprint Denver, a 41st in Fox station area and in the Sunnyside neighborhood. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Our next speaker is Jesse Perez. Yes. Go ahead, please. Jessie. Evening. Yes. Good news. A counselor was watching at home. My name is just the song Personal Representative for Black Star Action, Movement for Self Defense, Positive Action Command for Social Change as well as the East Denver Residence Council. For a long black nose. And I'll be the next mayor of Denver in 2023. I'm actually a guest on tonight. This um in this new Sunnyside has been rapidly gentrified. It's like a breeze of the city, and it seems to be nonstop of this. So if you approve, my Lord, just filling. That's the affordability. Not much. My my criteria. The people's criteria, what is actually affordable in this area. If you're really trying to keep the people that benefits, embrace that community, which I'm not this is not for people that have only lived in this neighborhood. This is for people that are very rich and wealthy. So I cannot support this to my I had a few questions. However, was there a good neighborhood agreement signed with the community? Was there a traffic study done? Was there a real study done? If I get, please get an answer to. But I would really spit it. Thank you. Thank you. That concludes our speakers this evening. Questions from members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 249. Councilmember Ortega. Sorry about that. Thank you, Madam President. I just wanted to ask if the developer of the project is in the room. If you wouldn't mind coming forward, tell us your name and then I have a couple of questions for you. Jonathan Bush with LCP development. Okay. Thank you for being here tonight. I think it's always helpful to have the applicant in the room when we have questions. So under the I am x three, how many units would you have been able to build on this site? I don't know that we really looked at it as a three story, but I would guess two thirds of that count. So the order of 40 to 50, maybe. Okay. And I noticed looking at the site map, everything on Jason on that west side is all the IMX three zoning. So to the to the east, you've got the higher density zoning in. I understand that. Creates the zoning on the east side, creates the changing circumstances for the area. But this will now create that domino effect on the rest of Jason. And that is the most adjacent street to the more single family residential to the west. And so I was just trying to understand why you chose to go with the five story instead of the three story. I think one and this is one of many tuned projects we've done and I think is a as a 2D project that's hitting a block from light rail. I think there's a certain responsibility to have density around light rail. And so in looking at in kind of looking at the three storey townhouse at the West, and we stepped up to the project across the street, the alleyway, which is going to be eight stories, just felt like a natural height. I mean, five storeys, as Bobby indicated, we met with the neighborhood on multiple times. They were very comfortable with that height, frankly, and I think they were encouraging about that height because of the proximity to light rail. So I think it was done for a lot of urban planning reasons, not just density. So for 73 units, how many parking spaces will be required to? 56? 56. Okay. And then you've got one affordable at 60% of the am I and six at 80%. That's correct. Okay. I think those are all the questions I have. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Flynn. Thank you, Madam President. First of all, it's commuter rail over there, not light rail. It's the it's the larger one. The Fran, could you address a question about the Sunnyside neighborhood plan? 1992, it's 30 years old, but I know that Sunnyside is included in the is it called Near Northwest NPI? I've not been following that process from Southwest Denver, but could you tell me from your knowledge, are you working on the Near Northwest MPI? I am not. I'm sorry, I am not part of that MPI. I was leaving. Are you working? And I'm just wondering, do you know, is there anything in this application that is at odds with direction that that that MPI is headed? No. And we brought it up to the team and we talked about it and we all agreed that that that's an area like we worked really closely with the developer into picking the appropriate districts. So we all agreed that that was what the plans call for and what our goals were, because at first they were asking for C and then we figure that Irvine was more appropriate for the area. And the five stories he explained was a good transition with the three, the eight. So we worked together on that. Okay, so although we can't reference it because it's not an exact plan at this point, there's no concern that this would not be consistent with what's coming. I don't think so, because a 44 person Fox station area plan, it's pretty accurate and it's still fairly new. So I think that that guidance is still pretty accurate. Mm hmm. Okay. Thank you, Madam President. That's all I needed to know. All right. Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. I have a question for CPD. Do you remember what zone district and how tall this application first came in at? When I got it, it was CMCs five. When I received it. Okay. Thank you. Thank you, my president. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And not seeing anyone else in the queue for questions at the public hearing. This closed comments by members of Council on Council Bill 22, Dash 249. Councilmember Sandoval. Thank you, Madam President. This area on Jason streets one block away from Enga and the 41st and Fox station area plan in 2009 actually calls out that it could be eight stories. And I've been working with the Sunnyside neighborhood to figure out how to transition down to the protected zone district in between Jason and the alley and the next street over. And so I want to thank CPD and the applicant for working on that because although there is plan support for eight stories CPD because of the Neighborhood Planning Initiative, we have talked about the need for this to be more of a transition zone and it has coming in at five stories. I want to also thank the applicant for working with the Sunnyside neighborhood, I think, Bobby, for being here in person. It matters when people show up, especially from registered neighborhood organizations, and this meets our plan guidance and all of the recommendations. So I'd ask my fellow colleagues to support it. Thank you, Madam President. Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And not seeing anyone else in the queue for comments all round the mill that I agree this does meet all of the rezoning criteria and we'll be supporting that this evening as well. Madam Secretary, roll call on Council Bill 2249, please. Sandoval. I swear. I. Torres. I black. I see tobacco. I. Clark. All right. Flynn. All right. Herndon, I. Hi. Cashman. I can eat. I. Ortega, i. Madam President. I. Madam Secretary, closed the voting and announced results. 1313 Ies Council Bill 20 2-2 49 has passed. Thank you to the members of the public on that one. We're going to our last hearing this evening. Councilmember Flynn, will you please put council bill 22, dash 250 on the floor for final passage?","A bill for an ordinance changing the zoning classification for 4151 and 4155 Jason Street in Sunnyside.

So that's the first item the staff is recommending that you take action on the final approval. The second item is to approve an ordinance extending the existing moratorium that has been in place since November 5th that has been amended on several occasions. The moratorium has limitations on certain rent increases and prohibits evictions except for cause. And that moratorium is scheduled to expire on March 9th. And we staff is recommending that we don't have any gaps in tenant protection measures while the 30 days elapses before the effective date of the permanent legislation. And therefore, we're recommending adoption of this urgency ordinance that would extend the moratorium for 22 days and it would then expire on the 31st when the new ordinance takes place. That concludes my staff presentation. Thank you. Any clarifying questions from council? We have at this point 11 speaker steps. If you want to speak on the side and please turn in your steps. Counsel I'm planning to continue the 2 minutes at this point. First Speaker Unless there are people sitting time. Is everyone comfortable that it's 11? Yeah. Latin speakers. We have 18 speakers on the next item after this two. This is 11 in one more. Oh, yeah. All right. And that's because this item is a fourth time. I think we've been referred so. All right. Our speakers and some of you have to people see it in your time. So then it'd be 6 minutes. Yeah, you get. Three, so be six up to six. That was what we had done before. So that's Barbara Thomas, then John Sullivan and then Greg McConnell and many more. All right. Barbara and John would each get 6 minutes. Barbara, your first. Yeah. I appreciate the early Ms.. Ryan and I said all those things earlier. I said all the good things earlier. Now I'm here to make a record as an attorney on behalf of a client. And that is, once again, I do not feel that this ordinance complies with secure. And that is primarily the point that I made before that it was. Didn't deal adequately. With preserving the historic buildings and historic element as mandated by the charter of the city of Alameda. In reading all the case law, I just said, you know, I've been looking at the tree and I missed the forest because this doesn't hasn't been addressed in your housing element. And I know your city attorney's going to tell you about. The black property owners versus the city of Berkeley and how my dear friend, Judge Jackie Joyce Tabor found it for the black property owners, saying that if you didn't address your housing element adequately, it isn't law. Jackie, who is a wonderful and one of the most beloved judges in Alameda County when she retired for the third time at about age 98, was overturned. And the Court of Appeals said they did address it in their E.R. for the housing element. You guys didn't. So guess what? Doesn't pass muster for the housing element. Compliance under the government code. Mandatory element of your what used to be the combined land use plan. Before I made the comment that it didn't adequately preserve the historic buildings and accommodate their preservation through. The. It extensive the lot, costs a lot of money to maintain a house, historical building, a Victorian brick foundation. You have to pull out your knob and tube, you have to redo your roofs and to recover that. And I know one of the persons who sent in some evidence on this indicated that he spent $1,000,000. $1,000,000 on a single family dwelling because he had to comply with the the historic with the historic preservation. Ordinance. And so along those two lines, I think that and I do think you guys do a lot of work, but I think you would have done a little bit less work and a better job could have been done if this had gone to the historic advisory commission, as well as the planning board on the housing element . I think this ordinance is premature. It's not well thought out. And you can see no matter what you do, you're making people angry on both sides. I mean, that's a good, good sign that there's a compromise that's workable. But everybody is angry. This isn't the right ordinance and it doesn't comply with the law, in my opinion, my humble opinion. The other thing I've addressed and I've read the city attorney and it's not this young man, but it's another person who responded that there are not conflicts of interest because more than 50% of the households or something in Alameda are renters. And that's that's apples and oranges. It's people. You guys are people. You're not households. So you have to get up the number of actual renters and compare it and see whether you. You are an exception. I don't know if you're an exception under government code 1090, which is a felony. And I think very seriously about whether I voted on something which I hadn't been cleared by my attorney in my personal circumstances. She will be allowed to vote on this. Everybody's not the same up on this council. Some of you are in different positions. Then you are vulnerable. Hmm. Violation of government code ten is a felony. You can't hold office and you can't be a lawyer. And it does come to pass. When I was on the council, our city attorney was accused of it and had to withdraw, resign. So even the best of advice is sometimes wrong. Anyway, I. Asked a lot of questions about the warehouses last time I was here. Nobody answered any of them. We'll see if that is going to hold up in a court of law. And thank you. Thank you. Next speaker John Sullivan. You have up to 6 minutes. Good evening, Mr. Spencer. Members of the Council and city staff. I'm John Sullivan, a housing provider here. Mm hmm. I might ask you, I just followed. I did get this passed up to you earlier. I just follow through on it. This color. I've been very closely involved with the rent mediation services. I'm sorry. I'm going to end it before you start speaking, because we're going to have to make a motion to continue. So I'd rather do that before you start speaking. So let's restart this clock and let's check our motion. Thank you. Sorry. Sorry about that. That motion is to be able to add. Because we're approaching 1030, we need to make a motion to consider the remaining items after this one, which is nine a the referral on the mixed use zoning and we have 18 speakers on that and that require four votes. So we have a motion. A second. All those in favor. Hi. Any oppose? No. So motion carries 4 to 1. So we will be able to hear the nine and then we take another vote around 11. So we're going to restart the clock for you, Mr. Sullivan. 6 minutes. Okay. Thank you. I've been closely involved with mediation programs here in Alameda County and also in San Leandro, Fremont and so forth. And I really. Feel read that there's a you know, concerned on some of the items before us on this and this rack structure as proposed for instance, when tenants receive notice of a rent increase going forward. They will receive instructions on how to file for the you know, for a hearing. And then with the new ordinance stating that every. Every increase above 5%. The landlord has to notify the city and that triggers automatically Iraq hearing. I think we are being naive, really, if we feel that the Iraq war can, you know, handle that kind of a lot going forward. So we really should look for some modifications to that. Our annual cost of operations tenants pay half. Landlords pay behalf. Obviously the cost of operations will depend to a big degree on the number of cases filed. Since the tenants can file regardless of the rent increase amount. Why mandate the automatic filing when the landlord notifies the city later? About 5%. That's redundant. You know, it's duplication. It runs up the costs to tenants and to landlords. And obviously it justifies, you know, future. Raises to the budget. You know, the obvious way, of course, to avoid this would be to raise up the threshold from the 5% to 8% or 7%. But I would be naive, I guess, if I expected that to happen tonight and then the second reading. But there are and maybe we should take a look at some alternatives, some really numbers to to if we could work through. And there's an alternative number one. We all know, of course, that the tenants, regardless of the increase, they can file for a hearing. When a landlord issues a 5%, he must notify the RAC. And this now would be a suggestion, alternative suggestion. The RAC would take no action unless the increase exceeded 7%, in which case the tenant would be notified. The indirect hearing would be would proceed. Alternative. Number two, if a landlord issues an increase exceeding 5%, he notifies the rec. Here's a suggestion then alternative suggestion. Rat would take no action if the landlord provided the landlord demonstrating in his notification to the RAC. Two things a and B they. Since a tenant moved in to the property. The average annual rent increase, the average annual rent increase has not exceeded 5% and the increase being offered at that time does not exceed 7%. That's a responsible landlord. And that really represents about, I'd say 80, 85% of our good landlords in MM. Today. And we don't want to run, you know, run them out of town. If the goal is to collect information on the increases about 5%, then that's being accomplished. But the other vital concerns are also being addressed. Number one, safeguarding our rack. This issue less cases protecting landlord tenant relations, no redundancy tenant can file if they wish, and keeping the operational costs to a minimum. No. I think adopting any either of those would be a win win situation really and would help our Iraq going forward . A few other concerns on the next page and I'll just you can maybe read through them, have ability questions and and some suggestions attached to it. And also a concern concern number three landlord representative representative visited there new ordinance says that a landlord representative must have an ownership interest in the property and this could be problematic for the reasons stated here you might look through them and then concern for would be. Relocation fees and a sensible remedy. I think that I have put in there. You might just look through that. I've been, you know, obviously being involved. We have here by voice here many times and. But because I'm really passionate and my desire to see this new look rack and board operate successfully and efficiently. None of my requests here tonight or suggestions are going to call them that involve any major change just by, you know, vital clarification. And please do take the time to give them some air tonight. You know, we need a little bit of clarity, just avoiding conflict. Now, to finish up, I've been actively involved with the housing issue here for the last 18 months or so. I appreciate your enormous efforts, really. I know you've put a ton of time and effort and worry and so forth into this. You're dealt a really a bum hand in not winning hand in court if you're talking about cards. I thank you every member of the city council for your dedication and your efforts. And also that would go to the staff for their continued effort and diligence. Thank you. Thank you. All right. If you want to speak on the side and please turn on your step. Great. McConnell is our next speaker. And then Mimi more. And then Philip James. Greg McConnell. Mimi. Philip James. After Phillip, I'll be Rosa, Linda Fortuna and then Maglia Vella. And then that's. I don't have any other speaker steps on this item. Mayor Spencer and esteemed council members. I was raised in Alameda and have the privilege of living here now. But I see friends of mine, other sons and daughters of Alameda unable to live in the city that raise them or getting priced out of homes that were once affordable to them. The plan before you does have some technical concerns that do need to be addressed. But I worry myself about getting priced out of the city. That is my home. Something to keep in mind as we make these deliberations. Alameda like the rest of the bay area, like the rest of california is facing a housing crisis. It's getting more expensive to live here every year and the housing supply is shrinking as more and more new residents move to the area. As existing alameda see their rents go up, where are they supposed to go? Alameda needs more housing, but it also needs to protect its current citizens. I urge the Council to look at this measure as a first step towards helping alleviate housing stress for alameda families. Keep alameda in alameda. Thank you. Thank you. Rosa. Linda Fortuna. And then. And then those are our last two speakers on this item. Mayor Spencer, City Council members. I'm concerned with the operational costs of this rent stabilization ordinance. Why do we need $1,900,000 budget per year? Debbie Potter said she estimates approximately 20 cap capital improvement plan cases that will come before the RAC every year. So that's 20 May or. Spencer said that she feels with the 5% annual rent increase, it will not trigger the RAC and the majority of the landlords will go along with. The plan and that it should be no additional burden on on the RAC. With this in mind, why. Are we projecting 1.1. Million 900,000 for this? Why can't we have the fee study group estimate a lower amount and decrease the bureaucracy involved? All across the United. States, voters are expressing their their anger with big. Government. And many Americans are endorsing a revolution to reduce the excess. Bureaucracy that the big. Government is imposing on the citizens. So, I mean, you've got. The Bernie Sanders, you know, people. And so it's it's just. Not something that we want to see to continue. So thank. You. Thank you. And our last speaker on this item. Malaya. A chance to turn in your stats. Good evening, Mayor Spencer and City Council. I think the. Polling that we just looked. At shows the overwhelming concern of voters in Alameda regarding the rising costs of. Housing. And I think it really is the. Purpose of government to provide justice. That's what was discussed when people were actually. Writing the Constitution. And talking about what. Type of government we wanted. They talked about the purpose of government being justice. And housing costs have soared. We need to take a first step. It's been a couple of years since. This issue was. Raised again for a second time before the council. And this is really what we need to do. We need to make sure that the council is listening to voters and taking a step to make sure that everybody stays honest. If you're going to make improvements to the property, making sure that those improvements are done, making sure that we're collecting data, I think that this ordinance. Takes. An initial step in actually looking at that and making sure that people are following through when they say. They're going to do something. I am still concerned about some of the issues in the in the ordinance as it was presented at the last meeting, in particular with the different types of leases that could be offered. I think there needs to be a strong look at that to make sure that we aren't allowing for major loopholes that will undercut what this council is intending to do. So I hope that there is some sort of remedy for. That that's looked at. Thank you so. Much. Thank you. All right. She was our last speaker on this item. Council members once to go first. Anybody I'll I'll I'll just off for day. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for everyone who's come out and. Showing their support on whatever side of the issue. I think it makes our civic life that much richer. When people are actively engaged, as is so many of you are offering your different perspectives and solutions. So believe you me. You know, we take notes and we try our best to incorporate the thoughts that are out there. I appreciated the yellow pamphlet that Mr. Sullivan put together is what it appears to me is some small steps, perhaps, that if we adopt some of these small steps in sending a message to the smaller mom and pop landlords here in town, that that we're doing our level best to try to. Is what I consider to be the burdens of this ordinance, as is especially on the smaller mom and pop landlords. I think for the renters in town, it will work effectively in terms of stymieing the excessive rent increases. So I think if this is adopted that we have a system in place, but I think it's come at a great risk, at a great cost, especially to the smaller mom and pop landlords who are being asked to bear certain burdens similar to what the larger apartments are are bearing, even though it's the larger apartments who cause this problem. So in the yellow pamphlet that Mr. Sullivan put together, I do see some ideas that perhaps if we adopted, we could send a message that, you know, we're trying our best for the small or mom and pops. For example, like the idea that he has here about the having eco housing come in or or an entity like echo housing to come in to evaluate instances when a renter claims that the situation the habitat ability of the unit is in question so that. The Rent review advisory committee then doesn't just have a he said she said think of or do I believe the rent or do I believe the landlord they can turn to eco housing as as a source for to validate if the what the situation is. So I think that's I think that's a a great suggestion. And I also I like the idea of. Well, the concern number three here is kind of interesting. I mean, having making sure that whatever relocation payment is required. For actually Mr. Rudd, is it. Number four. We. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, whatever. I need my glasses, I guess. Whatever relocation assistance is provided that it's provided, it's placed with the the next landlord. So that's something that makes sense because we want relocation assistance while we have. Concerns about the amount of relocation assistance. The relocation assistance ought to go to the home, because that's the whole point of it is for relocation. So. So I like that. I also like the idea that I what I saw on the. On the Internet today and which I do actually want to pursue. And again, it's along the lines of sending a message to the smaller mom and pop landlords. I mean, I would love to exempt owners of up to two residential units and only two residential units in Alameda from the requirement of relocation assistance in the specific instance of family move in. I think if we adopted that. A change in the relocation assistance formula. We would be sending, I think, a great message to the smaller mom and pops in town. I personally would have wanted to expand the definition of smaller mom and pops to those, you know, with less than five units. But, you know, I recognize the direction of the council. But if we can do something like that, I think. We would be, you know, demonstrating that we're for a strong rent protection ordinance. But we're also trying our best to lessen whatever impacts there are on the smaller mom and pops as so defined here, in which cases those owning no more than two residential units. So. Those are ideas that I want to throw out. At member Ashcraft. Thank you, Mayor Spencer. So and again, thank you to everybody who for months now has has talked to us. And former council member Barbara Thomas is right. We have talked to dozens and dozens of people for hours and hours. But that is the way we get better informed about this very complicated subject. I, too, was intrigued by some of the suggestions that I read. However, I would like to see this ordinance move forward tonight in its second reading in the form in which we approved it at the first reading. However, we've said all along, not only do we have an annual review built into this process and a three year sunset, unless this subsequent council renews, we can, as a council, bring this back before the Council to see what I want to do is at least give these very, I think, well-thought out vetted proposals a chance to be be used. And we can see, let's see the kinds of cases that are coming before the rack. Let's see if I don't remember hearing previously that the RAC has been inordinately bogged down by claims of properties being uninhabitable. But I think that if I know some landlords have raised the question of, well, what do we do if we pay 50% of the relocation fees and then the tenant doesn't vacate or stays longer, and then you have to go to court and do it in lawful detainer and it costs money. If we start hearing those those cases happening, if they're documented, this council can make a change before the year is up. And I think I mean, I think it's rather intriguing to to think of paying that 50% of the relocation directly to the new landlord. But let's just see how this plays out. I think we're making some assumptions that just aren't there, aren't there? Based on any verifiable fact at this point. And also speaking of assumptions. I know there's a tendency to want to believe that it's the large landlords who are causing all the problems. I've been on this council long enough to know that's just not true because they I mean, one of the most egregious cases that came before the council when I was first elected had to do with a four plex and senior citizens with disabled adult children getting 65% increase in their rent just because a landlord could. So, I mean, it's we want to protect all of our tenants and I don't want to create different classes of tenants. We want to be fair to our landlords, too. But what I think we've done is we've we've struck that balance. And I think we've spent a lot of time, put a lot of effort into this. I don't think it's time to start carving this ordinance up now before it's even had a chance to to take effect and be tested. Thank you. Amber. Amber. I just if I. Thank you. Two quick points. The first quick point is that, see, dealing with the relocation benefits situation to me is an emergency issue, because once we adopt this ordinance and once it takes effect 30 days after we adopt it off the bat, someone who owns a granny flat behind them or and they want to move in there, they're their their grandmother or their or their or their adult senior adult parent into the backyard home that's being rented out. Off the bat, they're going to have to pay up to $10,000 right now. So I think that's why we can't wait to see, well, is it going to happen? And we know that that's going to happen. And that's just an amount that is. And I think the reasonable person would agree that for family move in situations, especially for someone who only owns one rental unit, that's not reasonable. The second point is that the data is clear that it is the larger landlords. Of the 40 case cases that came before the rent review advisory board over the last two years. Of the 40 units that were subject to the Rent Review Advisory Board. Of the 40, 33 were larger apartments. The case that councilmember, as he Ashcraft is referring to is in Benton Avenue, and that was in 2013, prior to the initiation of the housing crisis that really started in 2014 and caught flame in 2015. So over the last two years, you know, it is clearly the larger land landlords, the larger apartments that have been driving this and caught between all that crossfire and fortunately has been the smaller guys. And Brody. So. Thank you, Madam Mayor. We've all talked a lot about this, so I'll try to keep my comments brief. You know, just to kind of address the point that my two colleagues were discussing, you know, I recall hearing a gentleman who lived I can't remember it was over near Blanding, but, you know, his rent. I think it was a veteran, a senior veteran back the first meeting we had over at Kaufman that his rent was raised like one or 200%. So that was a four unit building. And there was a couple senior couple that sent me an email saying that, you know, they were getting evicted for a move in when there was a vacancy and they weren't given an opportunity to stay in that one. So that was also for unit building. So I'm sure if I stretched my recollection, I would find other stories in my email and my talks with people on the street that, you know, there are smaller mom and pop landlords that are not behaving properly . So it's not just limited to the large ones. And on the flip side, you know, there are probably larger landlords that are not behaving badly, that are doing reasonable rent increases, that aren't evicting, you know, willy nilly. So I just I'm going to support this ordinance as it's written. I mean, there are things, I think that can be improved on it if we find that there's data showing, you know, there's hardship or if there's data showing that it needs to be tweaked, then, you know, we're all free to put in a council referral and have that discussion and kind of modify the ordinance. You know, we receive a lot of emails and a lot of communication and some of them get a little a little bit hostile in tone. And usually I try to just kind of brush them aside and say, I mean, these are our constituents. They're allowed to vent, you know, and that's kind of the deal we sign up for. But one in particular I do want to talk about somebody said that if that if we pass, this is going to increase hostility and hatred between landlords and tenants. And if that happens, that's our responsibility. And I don't I don't like to get up here and be preachy because that's not my way. But seriously, it's not. It's between. You all out there. It's between you, the landlords, and between you the tenants, too. It's up to you on how this works. If you maintain respectful relations, if you get along with your tenants, know if you do the right thing, there's not going to be hostility. All the small people, landlords that we heard said, I don't evict people. I don't raise my rents, not I don't raise my rent 7% or 5%. Most of them said I don't raise my rents. You know what the reality is? I think John White mentioned this back at the last meeting. And Kaufman. If that's how you're behaving, then. You're not going to be subject to any of the provisions of this ordinance because you're behaving right. So I didn't I was a little preachy back in the summertime, and I said, if, you know, if this keeps going, then the council's going to have to do more. And it did keep going. We kept hearing stories of rent increases. We kept seeing we saw the for 70 central happen within days of us passing a moratorium. So I plead to everyone, you know, let's see. Let's do the best we can to get along. Let's do the best to have positive human relations. You know, let's have peace in our city. Because if we don't. There was a measure ballot measure filed yesterday, I believe. And those are very strict rent control provisions. And without passing a comment on them, you know, one way or the other, I think if we continue on the path where we continue to have mass evictions, we continue to have people try to find loopholes. We continue to have massive rent increases at the tide in this community, and the public opinion is going to turn against landlords. So I plead with you, if you want to stop that ballot measure from passing, let's all just, you know, not to channel Rodney King or anything. Let's all try to get along. Let's all try to be reasonable. Again, I apologize for being preachy, but I think these are solid tenant protections. I think there are. With the CFP and some of the other exceptions that are in there that reasonable landlords can still earn a profit and still do reasonable things. But come on, folks, this is a long journey that we've had. Let's try to treat each other nice and try to treat each other fairly, and we won't have to have any more additional regulations. Vice Mayor. Thank you, Madam Mayor. I feel strongly about the mediation process and having observed it. It's success and. I think. Looking at this ordinance as its package, I do think it sends us a way on down the wrong path. And that path is a formulaic, one size fits all for probably the most important part of of the crisis that we've just seen. That being said, I think there are some good points. So another point is we can look at this and monitor it and change at any time we want. And secondly, I think the point about protecting from mass evictions by a proportion of low cost evictions that's allowed limited is a good provision. But at the core and we spoke about it earlier in the session that preceded the regular meeting, that mediation has been successful. And I strongly believe in it and. Well, we'll see what happens. Mary Spencer, may I just interject in response to things that were said about my remarks? Very briefly. Ah, yes. Member Ashcroft Nicely. So with regard to the success of the RAC, and I've said this before. It's difficult to really place value on the statistics we've seen because we have also heard from many tenants who were too intimidated to even approach the rack. The fact that they were tenants in larger associations. I'm aware of some of those. I mean, in larger buildings, groups of tenants went in together, so they had the power of numbers. But how do you measure the people who were too intimidated to use a process that was completely voluntary, that had no teeth? The the landlord could be there and they could listen and they could say, oh, you know, you say it's a hardship. You can't afford this. Well, I can do what I want. There was nothing that could be done. We've now put some teeth into the the mediation process, which I think has great value by adding the subsequent step of being able to take your dispute to a mediator. So I agree that I think mediation is very useful, and I do see some potential, even for some of the concerns that the small mom and pop landlords are bringing to me. I'm not unmindful of your concerns, but I agree with Councilmember Odie. I want to see this ordinance go forward as as constructed. If the if the rack was working so well, we wouldn't have have, you know, had to come to this point. Thank you. Thank you. All right. I wanted to ask, we had a public speaker speak to the E.R. for a housing element. Not being there doesn't. Protect us like it needs to. That somehow we're not complying with secure this. How to have a response to that. Madam Mayor, first I would point you to the sequel recommendation in the staff report, and you will see that the staff report makes a finding that this the passage of this ordinance is exempt from sequel as not a project. We stand behind that determination and we have Mr. Brown. From the city attorney's office who might want to speak to. This as well. Would you like to speak to this as well? Actually, I was going to defer. I'm happy to speak on it. The attorney that prepared that particular staff report is also here, Mr. Roush. So if. If he's in. There, I didn't see him back there. Mr. Roush. I misspoke. Yeah. Though. He's our city attorney. I didn't realize that. And way back there. Yeah. All right. Madam Mayor, members of the council, Michael Roush in the city attorney's office, the. With respect to the housing element issue, in fact, very clearly, the housing element does address this particular kind of matter. Housing element indicates that the city has a responsibility to maintain its housing stock, to provide a wide range of of housing opportunities, to make sure that persons of all income levels have housing opportunities. And this is exactly what this ordinance at least attempts to do makes those opportunities available. And so, quite to the contrary, the housing element does address that issue very clearly. And secondarily, with respect to the ordinance itself, as we indicated last time, if there are older homes, Victorians, etc., that need additional funding, that is a consideration that both the RAC and the hearing officer can consider when they look at rent increases that a landlord might bring forward. More fundamentally, this ordinance, though, does not change, does not have any impact, any direct impact on any physical environmental situations. This is really a a a, you know, it's so rent control. It's a it deals with rent. It doesn't going it's not going to cause any kind of environmental concern. And that's why. We concluded that it's not a. Project. And even if it could be construed as a project, there's no physical direct impact and therefore it's exempt. That risk was well. Glad to answer any questions on those two issues if you have any further questions. Thank you. I have other questions, but I appreciate those answers. In regards to government code 1090, if I'm correct on that, that that was the code section that suggested that, yes, that I'm a renter. And there's, uh, I understand he's one of the runner up here. And I think the comment suggested that because we're renters, we would be possibly subject to some criminal violation by voting on this. Could you address that? Yes, Madam Chair, I believe that the information that you heard was slightly misplaced. Government Code Section 1090 is about conflicts of interest by decision makers when they're entering into contracts. That's not what you're doing tonight. You're passing an ordinance, a law. So the application of ten, 90 to 90 is not applicable to the action that you're about to take tonight. All right. I appreciate that. It's actually quite a relief. Oh. Okay. Also there to me, there is a legitimate issue that so this is something that we can revise. And at some point I think council may want to look at in regards to if there's consecutive one year term basis, um, there could be small fixes like that that we may want to address at some point. Circle back at this point, I do plan to support it as is. I think that it is very important. I actually think it's extremely important that we take action tonight. I want to thank all of the members who have come out and shared their concerns for and against. This is really, really since November 4th, I think our council has stepped up. I want to thank council for all of their work on trying to I'm going to say, exercise your best judgment to meet the needs of our community. I want to also thank staff. This really is a lot of work. And and I think it's just extremely important. We have an unstable housing situation for many of our community members. And to me, that is something that we are trying to address and a what I'm going to describe as a balanced, measured approach. That we do have the ability to revise, which is to me one of the things that it is very important for 11:00 motion to continue. To make a really quick. Yes. Okay I move that we continue this meeting past 11 p.m.. All those in favor I was announcing so. So I do think it is the role of government and our council specifically. And I commend our council and our staff for moving this forward. I really think that we have tried our hardest to add that I want to say is teeth to Iraq and honor the work that Iraq has served our community well since 1979 and that we are adding a layer and that we can we can continually revise this measure. It is very different from a ballot measure that would be permanent, as my understanding, versus this this weekend, continually get feedback and we can modify it and make it better. It also includes by definition, part of it is annual reviews. I think it really is a is a very good effort by our council. That being said, we have a motion. It would be my pleasure to move that we we need to do this. We don't mean. Miss Potter so that we may have adoption. Of. One. Sorry, this. Got it. That one. The first thing I get. I move that we approve final passage of an ordinance amending the Alameda Municipal Code by adding Article 15 to Article six concerning review of rent increases applicable to all rental units and rent stabilization applicable to certain rental units, and concerning limitations on evictions and the payment of relocation assistance applicable to all rental units. Amending Section 2-23.4 concerning the duties of the Rent Review Advisory Committee and suspending Article 14 of Chapter six in its entirety and determining that adoption of the ordinance is not a project. And is California Environmental Quality Act secure? Or if it is a project, the ordinance is exempt under sequel. And do we do? There are. Two separate. Separate. Okay, that was a motion madumere. I'd like to make an offer, an amendment I would like to offer as an amendment that we move to exempt owners of up to two residential units and only two units in Alameda comma for from the requirement of paying relocation assistance in the specific instance of family moving. That's an amendment that I'm offering to this main motion. I would I would not support that. And and I don't want it to be part of the motion I just made. So we could address that separately. At this point, we have a motion. Do we have a second? Yes, second. Well, that was. I'm sorry. No, that's. Okay. Yeah. You have to address the amendment first. Okay. For you. So. Okay, so we vote on that separately, then. Then if he has a say. Is there is. There a second for the amendment? The proposed amendment fails for lack of a second. Now we go back to the main motion. Thank you. Thank you. All right. We have a motion. Do we have a second? I'll second the motion. All those in favor I made. If I can make other comments. What I said two weeks ago still applies. My grave concerns about the impacts on especially the smaller mom and pop landlords continues. But. As I said two weeks ago, in reflecting on what two different pastors had to say about the season of Lent. One talking about how in this big house we should work so that all benefits from, you know, what society has to offer. And that in this season of Lent, it's also a season of change. For that reason, I think the bigger picture my concerns about. The impact on smaller landlords notwithstanding. I think the bigger picture is that we need to move forward in addressing the rent crisis and we'll still have to figure out how to deal separately with my concerns. So I support this. All right. So I'm going to call the question again. Although some favor I oppose. No. Motion carries for two one and thank you. And then second motion. Okay. Okay. And I also move that we consider adoption of an emergency ordinance extending within the city city of Alameda, a temporary additional 22 days moratorium on rent increases for certain residential rental properties and on evictions from all residential rental properties except for just cause. Back. Any questions? Comments? Just one question. I mean, in the event that the audience we just passed skits, referendum referenda or whatever the proper verb is. I mean, what are how can we make sure that this moratorium covers the period where this ordinance might be suspended or held in advance? I believe we would come back with another ordinance, another emergency ordinance extending the timeframe. Or would there be a gap between. And that it's hard to hear. I'm sorry. Would there. Would there be any gap? If needed, we would. We could possibly schedule a special meeting to consider the urgency ordinance. We will know. I guess we would know if it's if the ordinance is referenced by the 31st, the same day that that the moratorium would expire. I suppose in the alternative, you could it. Could be a stretch. Or a moratorium a few more weeks. Or sorry. Conditionally. It. I think it a michael Roush again. Madam Mayor members of the council. I think what would happen is if we find that a referendum petition is being circulated, we will know that probably within a very short period of time. And if we see that effort underway, we would bring back and schedule for the council's action before the moratorium would expire and an extension of that so that. In the event the petition. Was filed timely with enough signatures in the council, still one to continue the moratorium. You would have adopted something so there wouldn't be a gap. Thank you. Thank you. So we have a motion to someone, so we have a second. Any other questions? Comments? All those in favor. My motion carries unanimously. Thank you. All right, now we're on item seven, City Manager Communications. Yeah. I remember I think I said most of what I needed to say before. I thank you. Thank you. Number eight, oral communication, non agenda. Do you have any more? We do have additional speakers on. All we do under public comment. Okay. Non agenda. Public comment. Non agenda. Public comment. We have two Catherine Pauling and can Peterson. Nothing. And you may have 3 minutes. And I thought. Thank you, Pauline. I'm what I wanted to comment on is when I was double checking language and requirements and everything, I went to the business office. To try to find out what data. Existed on rental units in the city. And I figured with people paying that $20 annual fee for each rental unit that.","Summary title: Consider: 1) an Ordinance regarding Rent Review, Rent Stabilization and Limitations on Evictions, Amending the Duties of the Rent Review Advisory Committee (RRAC), and Suspending the Current Article XIV of Chapter VI regarding Rent Review; 2) Determining that Adoption of the Ordinance is not a Project Under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) or, if It is a Project, the Ordinance is Exempt from CEQA; and 3) an Urgency Ordinance Extending a Temporary (Additional 22 Days) Moratorium on Rent Increases for Certain Residential Rental Properties and on Evictions from all Residential Rental Properties Except for Just Cause.

Councilwoman Mongo. Ocean cares. Thank you. Item 17, please. I'm Phil Bridge. Item 17 This communication from Councilwoman Price Recommendation two closed a pedestrian bridge at Emefiele Avenue in order to address persistent crime and public safety issues. Thank you, Councilwoman Pryce. Thank you. I do want to hear from the public on this. I know there are members of the public here, but before I do that, I want to state that the motion is actually different than the agenda item. Rather than requesting a closure of the bridge. We're going to be requesting pin code for the gate so that people, anyone requesting the code can get the code and be able to access both neighborhoods through the gate. And that's the proposal on the floor tonight. And I want to hear from the public about it, and we can talk a little bit about it. But I know there are competing standpoints and concerns with with the bridge access. And so we want to make sure that we address those concerns while providing access to anyone who should want to have it. So with that, if it's okay with you, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to go to the public comment, but I wanted to make sure everyone knew that it wasn't a bridge closure that we were talking about at this juncture. Thank you. And there's no need to stand, folks. I do have the public the the list. And so I will call you in the call the first few folks up. Okay. So the speaker's list and because we have more than ten, it will be it will be 90 seconds. So in this order, Mr. Goodhew, Zari Morrell, Dan Lowenthal, Amelia Ghareeb and Ron King are the first five speakers to please come forward in that order. And if I mispronounce your name, I apologize. So please, please line up. It's Mr. Goodhue, Zoe Morrell, Dan Lowenthal, Amelia Ghareeb and Ron King. Please come forward. Thank you. It's good to hear. It makes eminent sense. Move forward with it. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker. Hey, how are you doing? How are you, man? How you doing, customer? Christ. My name is Dr. Zoe Morrell and I actually live in Park Estates and I love living there and had always felt safe. However, the two most important things to me are my daughter's one day. Luckily, I have a practice in a usually in Los Angeles, I have a practice now in Los Alamitos. I got a call that somebody, a skinhead who looked like he was high on drugs, was throwing rocks at my house, called the police. And obviously this is a low priority item. Ten, 15 minutes went by. I got another call. No one was there. I actually went home. Went home. And that person was across the street, had tried to break into my house. I am not a person who has weapons. I'm a surgeon and I had a sledgehammer. So I went to try to disarm this guy with a sledgehammer. I called my across the street neighbor, who's also a physician. He happened to come home, called the cops again, who I respect and really appreciate. Still, no one was there. We had to physically disarm this person as he was breaking in to my across the street neighbor's house. Now, unbeknownst to me, his daughter was home. I only thought if my daughters were home, his daughter was home and she runs out after she keeps calling the police. Until we told them that he had a weapon. She wanted them to know that the two black guys actually were the ones who were the heroes and that we were the ones with the weapon trying to disarm this gentleman so that we would not get injured. This is really an issue because my daughters, I love to have them walk around the block. My my youngest started a dog walking business. I can't have her do that anymore. My other one babysits kids throughout the neighborhood. I can't have her do that anymore because they don't feel safe and it is unsafe. And I really think that disclosure will help solve that problem. Thank you very much, sir. SLAUGHTER Which is a long thought. Thank you. Good evening. It's an honor to be here. Thank you, Councilwoman Price, for all of your hard work. I strongly support this item. The I think context is important. When Park Estates was built in 1948, there was no bridge. There was no access from Atherton about ten or 11 years after that. There previously had been a creek behind Park Estates that ran parallel. To Atherton on the south side of Atherton. The county came in and built a storm drain. At that time, they granted a six foot easement from Atherton to reach the. Storm drain, and they. Did a cement bridge over. The storm drain. Both of those things were for access for the maintenance workers, not for public access into park. Estates, but it became. Commonly used for that purpose. That is not necessarily problematic, except two things have developed since that time. One is that there's a little alcove. Next to the bridge. It's entirely unlit, it's hidden, it's out of you can't be viewed. By law enforcement, and it's become a magnet of criminal activity. There are commonly syringes can be found there. Remnants of packages that are stolen from the neighborhood can be found there. People sleep there. The second thing is the bridge provides ingress and egress into the neighborhood for burglaries to be committed. My home was burglarized. I put up a sophisticated. Video surveillance system. It was probably torn down. The home was burglarized again. My neighbor's home was burglarized. And the commonality of all of these burglaries is each instance the person comes from across the bridge. Enters through a window, burglarized is the. Home, and then escapes back across the bridge undetected because it's just. So out of you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr.. Thank you. Thank you so much. Our next speaker, I mean. Good evening. My name is Amelia Greve. I am a resident of Sovereign Park Estates, which is a 156 unit owner, occupied cooperative apartments directly next to that bridge that we've heard so much about. I depend on that bridge to safely walk. My dog is a woman alone. My elder elderly neighbors depend on that bridge to go to church, to go to social areas, to. Go over the crooked duck, to get their exercise. I am that's my all that is our residents only access to safe, walkable areas. We don't have crosswalks across Atherton. All we have is traffic and E-Scooters. I do not have $1,000,000 home. I am a public school teacher, but I have that bridge and I have a safe. Place to. Walk and so do my residents. I strongly urge you to please keep it open for our neighborhood. Thank you. Thank you, Ron King. Hi. I too live in the Park Estates area, and this Alfred L filled bridge. It's about nine homes up from me or down from me, actually. And I noticed that when I first moved in the area, I saw this, you know, on a just a walk around the neighborhood. I saw this bridge. I thought, this is kind of odd. I walked over and it just goes over to the next street, goes over the wash area, the flood control area. And that was about it. But things also I noticed that after 20 some odd years of living, there is the crime. Escalated. And we live in an area right there in that area that there's no through roads or whatnot. You either live there, you don't, or you're just totally lost. And I wasn't surprised about the crime escalating. So the crime found me. My car was parked in in the driveway, probably. 30 yards from the street. And my fault. I didn't lock the door, but I got up the next day and it had been vandalized and everything thrown out of the car. Had some samples from my employment thrown all over my all over my driveway in the front yard. I thought that was quite odd. So time passed and whatnot. And this, this last year we were burglarized, which I thought, this is this is just crazy. But I will say this in closing, and that is the only traffic people I see. Disturbing people, per se. I mean, I said the good, the bad. Thank you so much. Time. Time's up. Six where I go. I want to keep the time timely. If my time's up. Yes, I didn't look. Thank you, sir. Let me go ahead. The next five speakers are Melissa Paulson, Garrett DiGiorgio, Ted Bruder, Tyler Paulsen and Ruth one. Please come forward in that order. Melissa Paulsen. Gary Director. Georgio Ted Aberdare. Tyler Paulson and Ruth one. Hello. I'm a resident of Park Estates. I just want to say that I strongly support this measure for the safety of my home and my family. Thank you very much, Speaker, please. Hi. My name's Gary DiGiorgio. I live 12 doors down from this opening. I just want to say that, uh. Progressively things have gotten worse in the neighborhood. My home has been burglarized. They've caught individuals directly in front of my home breaking into cars. And it's just it's a slippery slope and it's getting worse. Having worked in law enforcement for 25 years. I will tell you that. In terms of first responders, fire is not coming through there to save anybody. From a police perspective. It would enable them to hold a perimeter for. People who are in that community. For those that say, hey, I use it to walk through regularly, I would say that we have three other entry points. It would be a five minute more of a walk, which. I think is the councilwoman said earlier. Walking is healthy. It's good for everyone. So I would I would just ask that. You know, we definitely look at having a keycard or a complete closure. Thank you. Unit speaker, please. Good evening. My name is Ted Brunner. I am the track rep for that tract that has the entrance on Allen Field. I am also the president of the Park Estates Homeowners Association. I started this discussion with Suzy and Jack and Craig from Department of Public Works. About a year and a half ago, talking about all of the crime issues that we have and what can we do to control access. And at the time, we when we met out with Craig at the site and talked about putting up a PED gate, pedestrian gate with key code access or some kind of turnstile, something to control, ingress. Egress, so that we could keep the I can't bend it, but that's really what there are the homeless people and the addicts that come into park states. They have one path that comes through right by my house. I live right next door to that guy and they and I have my church member walking into three times. He stole my bike, jumped over my fence in broad daylight with people home next door to steal my bike. So these people have no shame. They don't have any threat. They don't they don't look at anything and say this is a bad deal. So we need to regulate access. And I'm not talking about cutting it off and sealing it. My proposal after item of proposal, it would be a hard closure for three months to change habits and then put the PED kid up to replace the hard closure so that everyone that belongs there can get in and then have the police department be in charge of handing out key cards. Criminals are not going to go to the PD to get a keycard and then you can just have them come in and out. Thank you so much. Our next speaker, please. Good evening, tyler polson. I am strongly in favor of this item. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ruth one. I also echo that notion. I'm a Pakistani resident and a mom of two young boys, and they do a lot of. Outdoor. Activities at night. They're big tennis players, and I don't actually feel safe with the amount of suspicious people that I myself have personally witnessed that very much are very disheveled. They look intoxicated. I have called the police myself. I've taken pictures of them on my neighbor's property looking into their windows. And it's just a very uncomfortable. Feeling that you. Cannot be outside at night. So thank. You. Thank you very much. And last speakers are Will Willie Gaffney, Rebecca Corrie, Margaret Lehnert says Margaret Cohn, who killed Ingrid Nicolay and David Eastman. Please come forward in that order. Willie Gaffney. Rebecca Corrie. Margaret Keough, Ingrid Nicolay and David Eastman. Good evening. Thanks for hearing from me. I'm Dr. Willie Gaffney. I also am. A resident of Park. Estates. What you guys may not know is that there's now a homeless encampment of sorts down on Atherton, which is just outside of our community. It appears that these some of the homeless people are accessing our neighborhood due to this walk away, and we very much would like to have it. Limited access. I am a neighbor of Dr. Morrell. My home is the one that was actually burglarized that day. A gentleman didn't get in, but I worry because my daughter was at home. She's 21 and she typically will leave our home to walk the dog and won't set the alarm. Can you imagine what would have happened if he had actually gained access and had been inside of our home when she got back from walking the dog? Can you imagine what would have happened if I had been home when he broke the window and put his hand in? I would have responded with lethal force. That's pretty dangerous. Imagine what would have happened if my daughter hadn't alerted the policeman that the two black guys were armed and were two good guys holding a white gentleman who was unarmed on the street. If they come around the corner and open fire, that that would have been a horrible outcome or could have been a horrible outcome. Now, I strongly encourage you to limit. Access to these bridges. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. If anyone else can, please just come forward and rest the speakers. Please come forward closer. Thank you. I'm Ingrid Nicolai. I've lived in the neighborhood over 30 years. Things have changed. And one thing that bothers me is that there are transients sleeping right down in there where the preschoolers. And whenever I walk through there, I'm thinking, these are kids that are two and three. I don't think they're four yet. But these people are walking through and talking to those kids. I don't think that's safe. I I've noticed that they're dropping all sorts of paraphernalia. They don't really. I've asked them to, you know, what are you doing? They said, it's none of your business. I can be here if you can be here. They're caring. I was upset when I saw driving down the block. Two or three of them who had stolen the tricycles from the preschool and their the bigger utility trikes. I should have stopped them, but I didn't. And I still feel bad about that. But the neighborhood is not safe having that open. They're all going through with bags. They're all riding their bikes. They're all going down the hill, turn in the corner to get out on Atherton. And I'm all in favor of putting a lock code on that gate. Thank you. Thank you so much. Next picture, please. Hi, I'm Rebecca Corey. I'm in favor of the game with Ingrid. I've lived in the neighborhood 30 years. And we've had. Nothing but break ins, robberies, packages, mail checks, stolen tags off our car, you name it. It's happened time and time again and I'm in favor of it. Thank you. Thank you. Speaker, please. Hi, I'm Margaret Kuo and I also strongly support this item. I live. In on a street that is adjacent to the bridge and. Have had packages stolen and have my. Had my car broken into. And I would also. Emphasize that it's called the bridge, but it's not really. A bridge. It's a very irregular. Pathway that is dark and. Kind of covered. Over with trees and hedges. And it is a source of concern and anxiety and worry when it comes to my safety. And the safety of my son. So thank you for taking the time to. Listen to the residents. Requests and to the rest of the Council. I would hope that you would support this. Agenda item as well. Thank you. Thank you so much. And David Eastman. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. I'm also Resident Park Estates. I have been there for 25 years. For 25 years, I have talked about all the criminals who are coming in through the gate off of Bellflower and over the bridge from from Atherton. But nobody talks about all the criminals who are coming into the neighborhood on Los Lomas Street, which happens to be where I live. Basically, what we've heard is we've got crime in the neighborhood. Yes, we do less and less than most places in Long Beach. The the basic idea that those criminals are coming across the bridge is based on no facts whatsoever. We have anecdotal material. I have suggested in the comment section that we do a very extensive statistical study before we either get it or even pass out cards for it. And I would like to see the criteria for the cards before we do that, because it may limit people outside who do come into our neighborhood and actually provide us additional eyes on illegal things because they're nice people who like to walk in our neighborhood. I know if this seems like there's an awful lot of money to spend. The Park Estates Homeowner's Association does have some money for neighborhood security. I know I was on the board, I was the treasurer for a number of years and there's quite a bit of money there that if the city thinks it's too much money to ask, then I think the homeowners association can kick in. Thank you very much. Very much. That concludes public comment. A Councilwoman Price. Sort of what we're looking at. So, Eric, I'm not sure if you're back there, but if you could cue up the photos. Okay. So just to give everyone kind of a overview of where we're at, this is the Park Estates area. And you can see the main cross streets that are relevant to this discussion is Atherton. And the red line there, that's where the bridge is located. So I'm just going to go through a few photos here. There's the flood control channel and you can see the yellow delineates where the bridge is currently located or the walkway. This is the entry point to the walkway from Atherton. These are a few photos of the walkway that you can see so that you can see what walkway we're talking about here. I believe that Judge Lowenthal is correct, that this was not designed to be in the beginning a walkway. It was designed to be an access point for maintenance. However, it has turned into a walkway. And you can kind of see what the ground of it looks like and what the condition is. This is the cul de sac area that the walkway leads to in the Park Estates neighborhood. So generally, anyone who's on the street and a vehicle would be someone who's living in that street because it is a cul de sac area. This is the viewpoint of the bridge leading into the bridge from the Park Estates area. And again, another shot of that, and this is the flood control channel. So I'm glad to be discussing this topic tonight with the full city council. For background, this has been a location that countless residents have contacted my office about for the past four or five years. It comes up at community meetings. I actually had one of the residents who spoke tonight came to a concert in the park, and while everyone else was seated outside with their picnic blankets, enjoying the music, he came specifically to talk to me about this bridge. And after doing so, promptly left to go home because he wanted to make sure he had face to face contact with me. It's been the focus of discussions at so many community meetings and it's an interesting issue because it's very localized to two different neighborhoods, both in the third Council District and actually it affects the fourth Council District as well because a lot of residents there use it and want to continue to be able to use it. So with the competing concerns that we have in mind, I've been working all day today to try to figure out a compromise that we can put into play on a pilot basis so that we can have the opportunity to collect some data, do a little bit more, study an analysis, and really track what's been going on. So a couple of things to the folks who I represent who live in the apartment complex. I get it. Walking is my absolute favorite hobby and my refuge. If I didn't walk, I wouldn't be sane. And so I understand the need to have the ability to walk and have access to beautiful neighborhoods such as park estates, and be able to have the peace and not be on a major corridor. Limiting access to residents who want to walk in the area is not an issue, and that's not the concern. The concern is the invitation for, as I've shown here, with no lighting, an area where people can seek refuge and have easy access points to residential communities, which I don't think is something that anybody wanted or hoped to to have. So I'm proposing adding temporarily adding a gate with a pin code that could be used to open the gate. The pin code would be freely given to anyone who emails or calls. In fact, between now and when the gate is installed, we will have a sign out there. And I'm hoping that the residents from both park estates and the apartment complex will help me share with people that there's going to be an access code, because we want to make sure that people who want to use this for walking have the access code. So after that, we'll have a sign at the gate that has the number or email address to contact in order to get the access code. So we'll set that up so that anyone who wants to can have access to it. Will it be perfect? Probably not. It's the first time that we've done something like this. So this is an opportunity for us to experiment and see what works and what doesn't. And that's what the six month period will be about. It's an it's an attempt to try to compromise. What I am asking from the Park Estates residents is if you see something, say something. You have to contact the police. You have to contact the police when you see something. Because if what you're seeing is not supported in police data in terms of calls for service, then it's not something that the city can rely on to take further action. So we'll be we'll be studying what happens in the next 30 to 45 days before the gate is installed. We'll also be studying. What happens after that. So I'm asking my colleagues to support me in this item. This is a local neighborhood issue and I ask for your support. Thank you so much, Councilman Austin. Okay. Members, please cast your votes. Comes Mamasapano. As a member, Richardson. Bush and. Kerry. Okay. Thank you very much. Motion carries will move on to the next item. Thank you very much.

My apologies. Councilmember Johnson. Thank you. Council President Harrell As you are aware, this piece of legislation will require all residential development in the city to either pay a fee to build more affordable housing or to build affordable housing on site. I'm very excited to bring this piece of legislation forward today, but before I speak to the bill, we have two small amendments. And may I suggest that now that Councilmember Bryan is back, we start with his amendment. Senator, in your timing, you have an amendment, I believe, to the section one one. Great. Thank you, Councilmember Johnson. I'll go ahead and move amendment number 1/2. But amendment number one does it corrects a typo that we caught in the process. If you look at the amendment, you can see where they changed the language specifically. We had always intended to refer to looking at the pin payment in lieu fees and how they affected projects inside of the downtown South Lake Union area. We actually had put outside in there and so this would correct that. So the bill has been moved. The amendment has been moved in second. And all those in favor of the amendment bill I, I opposed. The ayes have it. So it is a minute in that sense. So Council President Harrell I've got a Second Amendment that as you know, the establishment of the framework legislation is subject to our 36.7 a .50. Our legal team has requested that we amend the ordinance to include a findings of fact which demonstrates how our program meets the requirements of the our CW, including facts related to our affordable housing need, and outlining how the proposed program will operate in accordance with state code. The amendment is proposed to insert a new section into the ordinance to attach the findings of fact. And I'd like to move Amendment two to amend Council Bill 118736 by adding new Section one and titled The City Council hereby makes the findings of fact an attachment add to this ordinance. Second. Second. So a Second Amendment has been proposed by Councilman Johnson in the other questions on the amendment. All those in favor of the amendment vote i. I opposed. The ayes have it. So we have an amendment piece of legislation with two amendments. Councilmember Johnson, you. Wouldn't mind allowing me to speak just for a few minutes on the underlying bill? Council President Harrell I want to first start by saying thank you to the members of Washington. Can LGBT, LGBTQ allies ship as well as Puget Sound Stage for showing up today to testify in support of this program? This program is critical for the success of our city. As you're aware, rising housing costs in the city are having a real impact on our residents. Over 40,000 of our households are paying more than 50% of their income in rent. We know this burden is experienced even more acutely by communities of color. We hear from residents every day who are struggling to afford to stay in the city of Seattle, where they move away from their families, from their places of worship, from their schools, to get the services that they need, they need to be able to afford to live in the city. We must address the tools with all the available tools in front of us. And I think this is a critically important tool in order to build out 6000 affordable units towards our goal of 20,000 new units over the next ten years. We had a great discussion over several months around this legislation. We heard from many folks who in the community emailed, called or stopped by our hearings or our public meetings, and we made some significant changes to the legislation. And I want to thank in particular Councilmember Herbold and O'Brien, who spent a lot of time working with me on this legislation. One of the elements that we heard is that the community was interested in seeing a greater percentage of the units that will result from this program being built in the neighborhood. So we amended the legislation to include that. We heard that the community would like the term of affordability to last longer. So we amended the term from 50 years to 75 years. We heard from the community that they wanted us to do a better job of allowing folks who are renting in that building when it gets converted into homeownership, be offered the opportunity for first rate refusal to stay in their building and purchase those units. We, I think, really heard from the community about how they want more accountability and reporting. So we changed the timeline to advance how early reporting, to understand how the program is really working as it's intended to. This bill is a culmination of years of dedication from advocates in the community who have been fighting for more affordable housing in the city. I was proud to shepherd this through the city council. We've still got a lot of work in front of us. This bill doesn't actually change any zoning codes today, but what it does do is it provides an important framework to ensure that every new residential development the city will either pay a fee into the Office of Housing to build more affordable housing or build more affordable housing on site. I'm proud of this piece of legislation and encourage my colleagues to vote yes. Thank you, Councilman Johnson. Any further comments on Council Bill 118736? Councilmember Herbold. Thank you. So this legislation is definitely historic in that we will, for the first time require developers to contribute to affordable housing whenever they build. That's that's a really big deal. I want to highlight the other sort of historic nature of this bill. For the past 30 years, housing advocates have been trying to get displacement mitigation recognized. The amendments that we worked on to this bill, I think, takes a really important step towards towards that effort. Councilmembers O'Brian and Laquita were the first to encourage the city in 2014 to discuss and study how development left unregulated, regulated without some level of mitigation can impact vulnerable communities. Before that, displacement was largely unrecognized as a result of development. We know that between 25 and 2015, the city permitted the demolition of almost 6000 units of housing. We don't know how many of them were affordable and we don't know how many of them were rental. But we do know that those were units that were contributing to our our housing. Dock. Since older buildings are more likely to be affordable than new construction, this inevitably has been an impact on our our affordable housing stock. The. The efforts of this amendment, I think, are small and incremental. They will not stop housing demolition in the city, but it is an important recognition that a racially inclusive and affordable city will mean taking steps to not lose what affordable housing that we already have. Thank you. Thank you. Katherine Herbert. Any further comments from any of my colleagues? Council Member O'Brien. Now, I'll just briefly want to also thank council members Johnson and Herbold for your great work on this. This is an outstanding piece of legislation that I'm very excited to support today. For the reasons you've heard before, requiring that all development contributes to affordable housing in the city is a great step forward. Also, the work around addressing displacement. The language in this bill, I think is a great step forward. There's a lot of good language in this bill, but until we do further actions both around how we address displacement and the zoning changes needed to necessary to make this implemented, it'll just be language. And so I'm proud and excited to stand with my colleagues today and support this, recognizing that we have some ongoing work to do so we can actually get more affordable housing in our community.

So this item is kind of a follow up item from a vote that was done before I was on council in April 2016. The goal of that item was to make sure that we had peace programs accessible to residents and businesses in the city of Long Beach. Why? Green was one of the companies that worked directly with the city at that time, and they were allowed to do commercial and multifamily projects, but not residential. And it's been my understanding that that was kind of phase one and that there would be a phase two. There's been some changes to the legislation. And so we wanted to make sure before we brought everything back that we worked with city staff to really come forward with a report. And so I'd like to ask for my colleagues to support this item with the understanding that staff would come back. And we had said 45 days, and that was whenever we were talking about it coming back our agenda using this early January. I just wanted to hear from staff your thoughts on the item and then when is the soonest that you believe you could come back? Thank you, Councilmember. Yeah. We have a long history in the city with PACE programs. We're actually one of the first ones to adopt the business peace programs when it first started. And we've had a couple of successful projects here in Long Beach. From the get go, we you know, the staff have had some concern about the residential aspects just because some of the underwriting standards weren't very strong and people could get into into some borrowing that they weren't quite aware of what they were doing. So we have not been a city that has really gone the residential path. You're correct that it has changed recently. There's been a lot more consumer protections that have been put on by the state. We're in the process of analyzing those right now, but they do look to be, you know, pretty significant. And so we believe we can come back with a report sooner than 45 days. We're already working on that. At the top of my head, I'd estimate it, but probably about 2 to 3 weeks. We'll have something that we can bring back, at which point we would make a recommendation. Great. Thank you for that. So I'm looking at the calendar and hoping to have something back on February 12th or February 19th. And I do want to just elaborate. I've also had many, many conversations with Y Green and other companies which might speak tonight. I know that why Green itself, they make sure that they have a full process, that audio recorded interview that people can back out of the program if they want to, they screen all their contractors. And so I'd like to, in your report, kind of go over, make sure that it includes the contractor piece, because I know sometimes they might go with a contractor that might not have high standards, but just understanding what the requirements are at the state level for that. But I encourage my colleagues to vote for this report back. I think it's a step in the right direction for our residents to be able to have access to greening their homes in a responsible, effective way. Thank you. And Councilmember, if I can add, when we come back on our report, we'll be looking at a number of different companies. You're right. We have heard from wide ranging. You heard from others who have been interested in this for a while. So we'll address that in our recommendation. And can I ask, is there something keeping the city from working with from allowing multiple companies to provide pay financing? There's not. And we'd actually recommend that if you're going to go this route that you do several so that there's some competition and our residents could benefit. I just wanted to make sure that was clear for everybody. Moving on tonight. Appreciate that. Thank you. Yes, Councilwoman Gonzalez. I want to thank Councilmember Pearce for bringing this forward. I, too, had a lot of questions relative to this program, and I want to make sure that we're on the same page and that we get a report back that's amenable to us all. So thank you for doing the work. Thank you, Councilman Orson. Thank you. And thank you, Councilmember Pearce, for also bringing this forward. And I think the concerns that I have were mostly addressed. I do have one concern about the accountability of these programs and understanding as a city what the the the complaints or or may be regarding that is there and I guess for staff, is there a mechanism or for for for that to be more more transparent and for us to review that, you know, moving forward? So we can provide some some of the stories that we've heard about. There have been, you know, a number of lawsuits and some stories in the past that have been, I think, chronicled very well by the L.A. Times, particularly about low income households that thought they were getting one thing and ended up getting something else. That, frankly, has been a big part of our of our hesitancy. But we'll try to cover as much as we can with the state protections that have gone in place. So there are a lot of those problems we believe have been addressed through state legislation. So we'd like a chance to kind of tell you what our concerns are, why we haven't done this in the first place for a while. And and then also what we believe some of those resolutions have been on the state level. The city won't have a lot of that information even after we opt in. Our role is really just to, as a governing body, say, we want this or we don't want this. And then there really is very little government, you know, city interaction. So we don't we don't staff the program. We don't get reports. It really is just you're lending your name to the implementation of the program. Okay. Thank you. Why do we do people coming in? This is only people coming. Thank you. Good evening. Honorable City Council members. My name is Jeremy Hartman and I'm with Renew Financial where the administrator of the California First Pays program. And I want to thank Councilmember Pierce and all of you for. For looking more into pace. It's a it's a very successful program. We operate in about 80% of the state and a significant portion of L.A. County. And we've actually been offering our commercial program in Long Beach since 2015. When you first joined commercial programs, we really think that multi provider model is is the best solution because it provides most options for property owners. It provides them the opportunity to choose between different pace programs. And like Mr. Modica was saying, there's been a lot of improvements in consumer. Protections and regulation at the state level and. We look forward to coming back and presenting our program in more detail and talking to you more about all the steps that the industry has taken to to really make this as good and experience as possible for homeowners that want to improve their properties and and make them more energy efficient and and conserve water. So thank you very much for your time. Thank you, sir. Next speaker. Good evening, Vice Mayor and members of the Council. My name is Jeff Simonetti and I'm with the Capital Core Group. I'm speaking on behalf of both Renu Financial with the CCD and Energy Efficient Equity, which is part of the CMF. We appreciate the recommendation to bring multi providers forward. For when you consider this, it sounds like in early February and we really feel that a multi provider platform really gives the consumers more choice to fit their needs. And once we bring this back, you know, I think that the PACE program has really taken some steps over the last couple of years with the with the new legislature legislation at the state level to put in consumer protections, to talk about, you know, confirmation of terms, calls and making sure that people, when they get into their assessment, really understand what what the program is all about and and how they will be assessed. I think the program has really, as a result, become a much better program, much more transparent program. And we're happy to provide you with more information on that. So thank you for your time this evening. Thank you very much. See, there's more. There's no any more public comment. And that would you please cast your vote at. There. I'm queued up. Excuse me. I didn't see that going. I do have a question. Perhaps to the to the maker of this motion. Is it is it possible for us to include, when this report comes back, some language in there that protects the public in terms of advertising, marketing, their inclusion in these programs? I. Elaborate a little bit more for sure. There's there's been some misuse of these programs in the past. Where the vulnerable. Communities have been. Targeted. Right. And I believe that the report that will come back from staff will highlight the state changes to to rectify that. And so that's what they'll come back with. And if at that time we want to make some recommendations to go forward with also including, then that would be the time to make that addition. That's correct. Some of the state laws had to do with underwriting standards and others had to do with some of the unscrupulous, you know, calling and selling a product that wasn't quite the product that was to be sold. So that has been, as we understand it, addressed by state legislation. We're just trying to kind of verify and really understand that as a city staff. Well, we put out that report. And the other thing that it's my understanding that's been included is also the ability to should you get into that into a situation, you can completely back out of the program as well. And so I expect that that will be in your report. Yeah, the state has set up some ability for people there to exit, as I understand it, or some type of compensation that the state has set up for people who are really in distress, financial distress. So I will be trying to understand that more and provide you a report. And of course, in looking at the agenda item specifically, I would just ask that it be included in the resolution as well. Okay. Well, we're not voting on a resolution tonight. No, no. But when it comes, I think that was I don't know if the item was amended, but it says requests city manager and city attorney to review that for potential adoption. Thank you for that, Susie Councilmember Price. Yes, I'm totally fine with that. I just wanted to make sure we knew what we were voting on. And we would suggest that you come back with the report first and then we can take that that next step because we'll have to produce a number of different resolutions for, you know, whatever it you recommend moving forward for several different firms. Great. Thank you. You want to continue big on that? No, I'm good. Thank you. Fine, thank you. Okay. Could you please cast your vote?

Thank you. Motion carries with it. I understand. We're going to go. There's been a request to go back to the hearing. To reopen the hearing. We got a motion. First, Mayor, we would need a motion to reopen. Reconsider. And a second on that. And then take a vote on the motion to reconsider. And then it would be as though we're starting the hearing again. Correct. So we're going to go ahead and do the motion to reconsider first. Can I get a motion, please? Motion to reconsider. I need to push the motion, please. I was that. But that's not the. There's a motion in a second to reconsider the hearing. Is there a public comment on the reconsideration? No. Not yet. This isn't the actual hearing yet. Just so you know. There's. Okay. So we're. We're okay. So, members, we do a roll call vote on the reconsideration. Councilwoman Gonzalez, Councilmember Pierce. Hi, Councilman Price. Councilmember Sabrina High. Councilwoman Mongo. I. Vice Mayor Andrews. Hi, Councilmember Arango. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson. Hi. Okay. We're going to reconsider the motion. Councilman Pearce. Yes. First, I want to hear from the audience that's here. I don't believe that they heard the call for public comment earlier. And then I have some questions for Craig back after we hear from our constituents. Okay. Public comment, please. Hi. I'm back. I. Good evening, Mayor. Members of City Council. My name is Porter Golberg and I serve as co vice president for the fourth Street Business Improvement Association. We are incredibly thankful to Councilmember Pearce for her leadership in championing the addition of parking meters to our business corridor. We'd also like to thank the Public Works Department for their support in guiding us through this new venture for our association. Fourth Street is one of the most thriving business districts in Long Beach, and the addition of parking meters is a welcome addition to our business district, as it will increase parking availability to the many guests who patronize our businesses, bars, restaurants and nonprofit organizations. Additionally, new parking meters will ensure our business association has a sustainable source of funding to support our efforts to continue to beautify Fourth Street, enhance public safety and increase promotion of our diverse array of businesses and nonprofit organizations in our district. On Fourth Street, we pride ourselves on our diversity and longevity as a small business and organizational hub. In an increasingly corporatized business environment, parking meters will only serve to enhance our ability to get out the message that by shopping, local patrons are not only supporting our thriving poor street community, but investing in the overall prosperity of Long Beach. Thank you again for your support. We are incredibly grateful and look forward to future partnerships with our elected leaders and with city staff. And with that said, the Board of Directors does respectfully request, based on previous conversations we've had with city staff, that the that the City Council consider amending the recommendations so that our meters are available for up to 3 hours for our patrons as a district that has both restaurants and the only single screen movie theater in the city of Long Beach, we want our parking meters to be available for folks to attend a dinner and a movie without having to leave halfway through the movie to refill their meter and also to consider implementation of parking meter fees Monday through Sunday. And in addition to just Monday through Saturday as Sunday is an incredibly vibrant shopping day for our local businesses. So thank you again for your support and we look forward to partnering with you on this new venture for Fourth Street. Thank you. Thank you very much. Any other public comment on this? Okay. I do have I do have a question and I'm obviously very supportive of the meters. But in light of that record, I just wanted to understand the three hour. Are we doing it anywhere else in the city currently? Just wanna make sure it's something that we can actually do. I'm assuming there's been some conversations already about that. Mr. Beck. Mayor, members of the council? No. Typically the parking meters are set it to our time limit. It's a challenge when we consider whether or not to meter on street parking. Certainly we do our due diligence and make sure that we're in a business corridor, that we're primarily adding metered parking for the business community. And one of the reasons that we do on street metered parking is to create turnover. So customers coming to frequent, those businesses have an opportunity to park and we don't see some of the long term parking that we are experiencing in business corridors that don't have parking meters. So all of our parking districts are currently limited to a two hour time limit. I certainly support the Fourth Street Group and all the wonderful things that they've done over there to promote business and become a thriving business corridor. But it would be somewhat of a challenge for us to extend to 3 hours. I certainly support the addition of Sun, if that's the way they want to go and we can work with them on amending the hours. So if they want to start earlier or go longer, that's certainly an option for us as well. But it would be a challenge to have one parking district that is different from our other parking districts. When you start thinking about it citywide. Okay. And I only ask a question because this is a first I've heard of the three hour chain. So I just want to make sure that I understand it because I also absolutely support the requests in front of us and the meters and everything else is because I've actually never seen a three hour common anywhere else. I just want to understand, Mr. Beck, I don't know that I've ever seen three or maybe it is common, but is there are there other beach cities or other areas that have three hour meters? I think what we've seen, Mayor, is that off street parking is usually longer, but on street parking is usually more limited. And so when I think about the fourth street corridor, I do believe we there is while it isn't as many parking spaces, there is an off street lot. Maybe that has an opportunity to extend the number of hours for the off street lot versus the on street parking. So do we know if there are other other metered parking districts anywhere that have 3 hours? I just I just. Don't know my knowledge on street. Okay. But this three hour issue was discussed prior to today. Not with myself, but possibly with my staff. Okay, Count Councilwoman Pryce. Well, I'm I'm hearing about this request right now, but I have to say, I want to hear what the rest of my colleagues have to say about this. But I think sometimes we push too hard to have consistency throughout the city. And in the process of doing that, we forget that we have different needs all throughout the city. I know, for example, in Belmont, sure, we wanted to extend our the five minute zone to a ten minute zone because it makes more sense for the types of businesses that we have on that street. And I think sometimes if there's something that's going to work better for one community versus another, we should be willing to, you know, go outside the box. These are smart meters. So unless I'm missing something, I don't know that it's going to be an additional burden on city staff to somehow and perhaps I'm missing it somehow be able to facilitate the three hour request. I think that's probably one of the advantages that was brought to our attention when we were considering smart meters is that we could have different programs in different parts of the city and tailor make them. And so I'd like us to be able to do that, if that's what the community is requesting. There is a movie theater in this stretch. There's no way a person can go in and see their movie and still be able to fall within the two hour time period. So I think allowing us to go outside of the standard parking hours makes sense in this community. And I understand there's a parking structure. I think I just heard someone say that. But I think this is something that's important to the to the businesses. And this is something they've talked about and this is something they're requesting. And we could at least try it as a pilot. And if it doesn't work out, if it becomes too burdensome for the city, then we can go to the two hour. Those are my thoughts. Thank you, Councilmember Pearce. Thank you. And thank you guys for coming and speaking on this. I do know that the 3 hours conversation has been a conversation for the last year, back and forth and. I kind of struggled with the idea of wanting consistency across the board. But I do think that this is the first time that we've had a bid this small decide to put meters there and that this is a request to make sure you can have dinner, go shopping and see a movie in 3 hours. Makes sense to me. My the things that I would like to see is that it'd be extended to 3 hours that we add Sunday. I know the time that we talked about was nine or ten. I think it's a residential area. I think it's 10:00 and is it 10:00 and in Belmont and everywhere else. So that would be I think if we went 3 hours, I would want to see us at ten instead of nine to make sure that residents can sleep in like me, who some days I don't have to go to work to 11. Those are the three changes that I would like to see. I respect staff's position on wanting it to be across the board. I think if we could reevaluate this in a year and look at how that has worked out, it would be ideal. I did have one question on the type of meters, are they going to be individual meters? Are they going to be one per ten spaces? Councilmember Pearce These will be single style meters, smart meters, similar to what we have in Belmont. Sure. So the programing aspect isn't really a challenge. I think as I mentioned, part of our review of the financial analysis and how much is this area going to generate financially to be able to pay off the capital investment took into consideration certain assumptions about turnover. And so certainly the three hour time limits change that turnover number. So I potentially anticipate that we may need to extend that repayment period for the capital investment, but that's something we can look at and monitor as as you suggest. Okay. Thank you very much. So those are my changes. I need to make a formal there. Can you make that in the form a motion councilmember? Yes, I would formally requested I hate doing these formal things to amend the motion to include extending it to 3 hours. Amend the motion to include Sundays for meter day. And that the start time for the program be 10 a.m.. I don't know if that was in the thing or if it was nine. And thank you. 10:00, right, counsel? Yeah. Okay. I think we're just that your second. Okay, great. So and again, I want to just again say I absolutely support this. I just want to understand the the three hour piece. So I appreciate the dialog, too. That was that was helpful. And Councilmember, I do think the idea of a pilot and checking how we're doing a year from now, I think is really smart. And that gives the ability of the of the association to the Business Improvement District to also evaluate. And and I want to thank you guys because not a lot of business districts voluntarily come forward and want to put in meters. And I think you guys get why it's good for the district and good for flow of traffic as well. And so thank you guys for that. There is a motion in a second to for for the motion, please, to a roll call vote. Councilwoman Gonzales, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Price, Councilmember Supernanny. Hi, Councilwoman Mongo. Vice Mayor Andrews, I. Councilmember Durango. Councilman Austin. Councilmember Richardson. Cancer Council member Wangari there. I thought I heard you motion curious. Thank you very much. That is so.

The bill passes and the chair will sign. It will occur. Please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf. Okay. We have arrived now at agenda items 35 and 36 colleagues, as I mentioned, at the top of the agenda. These are the the major budget actions related to the full city council budget as amended during our Select Budget Committee process. So this is an opportunity for if if councilmembers are interested in making comments about the budget as a whole, this would be the time to do that. Before we go ahead and have the clerk read these items into the agenda. I did want to make a note on behalf of the city clerk's office that the budget documents that were approved at the Select Budget Committee weren't able to be updated and pre-loaded into today's City Council agenda. So Council Bill 119938 and the other records. Let's see what else we updated with the updated records and is available online. So. So again, folks. These materials were not uploaded within the agenda was published but are now available online. So if you are interested in taking a look again at click file 314464 that is now updated on the registrar but was not included on our published agenda. Same for council bill 119938. So for the benefit of you colleagues and members of the public, these documents are now uploaded and available online for viewing by the general public and by each of you as council members. Okay. So I'm going to have the clerk read items 35 and 36 into the record. And. Excuse me, agenda items 35 and 36. Quick file 314464. City Council changes to the 2021 Proposed Budget and the 2021 three 2026 proposed capital improvement program. The Committee recommends the clerk copy approved and file council bill 119938 adopting a budget including capital improvement program and position modifications for the City of Seattle for 2021 and creating positions exempt from civil service law by two thirds vote of the City Council. The committee recommended the bill passes amended councilmembers Macheda Herbold, Gonzalez Suarez, Lewis Morales, Alice Peterson and Strauss in favor and council members to want to post. Thank you, Madam Clerk. Councilmember Mesquita, as chair of the Select Budget Committee, you are recognized before we vote on the next two items, and then I will open the floor to comments by other council members before I take up each item individually. So again, colleagues, if you'd like to make comments related to the 2021 budget as amended by this by the Select Budget Committee, now is the opportunity for you to get into the queue in order to make comments generally about the budget. I will after make after everybody has made comments we will take votes on, but on the clerk file first and then on the on the council bill. But I won't be asking for additional comments when I call up each individual item. So again, if you want to make comments, now's the time to make comments. You can do it on both the clerk file and council bill. Once we close out comments and debate, we'll just going to go straight into voting on each one of these items. But we're not going to open up. We're not going to open it up for comments once I call them up for a vote. Okay. Council members get a you are first up and colleagues as you feel moved to make comments, please raise your hand so I can begin a list in the order that I see folks council or state up, please. Thank you very much, Madam President. And I do hope folks feel moved to highlight some of the pieces that you all have included in this budget. And I'll make some opening comments. And then at the end, if there's pieces that haven't been highlighted, I would love to summarize a few additional pieces before we close out. I want to say thanks again. I am moved I moved by the testimony and the movements that we've all seen manifest across this country. I am moved by the urgent need to act to make sure that people have the services and the housing and the health services that they need in order to sustain the crisis of this pandemic. And I am moved by the urgency to make sure that our workers and our small businesses have the support that they need so that they can continue to offer services and that there will be employment for workers as we recover from this crisis. I'm moved to do this work because all of you have stepped up in so many ways this year to make sure that we have done the work of budgeting through a racial justice lens and that we have come together in this time that requires us to act outside of our comfort zone and push the bounds in terms of what Council had previously considered their responsibility as it relates to the budget. This was no easy task when it came to COVID and economic downturn, civil rights uprising and working remote back to back meetings and passing the jump start progressive tax revenue. It is a really an incredible list of things that this council has been able to act upon in a very short time. And we are going to continue to work together. We are going to continue to work to make sure that our community has the services that it needs. And we now, thanks to your work, thanks to central staffs, health and leadership as well, we have $40 million in reserves that we know we will immediately need to begin looking at as we help those who are dealing with a third wave of COVID and the unexpected nature of COVID and the economic downturn that will manifest in 2021. This will be a robust process, and we want to lead that effort with the community partners, many of whom we have engaged with over months, to create the jump start progressive tax proposal and identify ways that we can refund or rebuild that original spend plan that was planning to invest up to $89 million in assistance for COVID relief. We know that the crisis is urgent, and we have invested in many ways this summer and through this budget process in preparation for the worst yet to come. Your council, your city is working for you. We are stepping up to make sure that there is a hand, a hand to hold through this crisis of the economic downturn and the uncertainty that the pandemic is imposing on our health and our livelihoods over the next year. I'm really proud. I'm really proud of the work that we've done together. And I say that in the same breath where I say, I know we have much more work to do. This morning's conversation, the last two months worth of conversation, the conversation since June and May and previously in the spring of this year. We know there is tremendous work that must be accomplished together and that across the country people are demanding more of their electeds. And we need to be bold, we need to be courageous, and we need to keep pushing ourselves out of our comfort zone. We have done that in many ways, and we will continue to need to do so in the upcoming months. In this budget, you'll see the ways in which we have worked together to identify investments in not just recovery, but. A more equitable recovery, recognizing we should not go back to the way things were before when so many at the bottom had so little, and just a very few at the top in this city had so much . We want a more equitable recovery, and that's what jumpstarts progress a payroll tax begins to do. We've also invested in making sure that more folks, more working families, more small businesses can sustain this crisis by having assistance to small business support, rental assistance, eviction prevention, food assistance, childcare. You all have made it possible for people to have greater self-sufficiency and economic stability, which also helps our health. Because when we live in chronic poverty or generational poverty or we're on the cusp of not being able to pay our rent or paying for our property. If you have a small business, that chronic stress also hurts your physical your physical health. And right now, we need everybody in this city to be healthy. We've invested in direct measures to make us healthy as a city. We've made sure that there's handwashing facilities and garbage clean up. We've made sure that folks have access to good, high quality food through fresh Xbox program, and that we've also maintained commitments to make sure that there is access to ethnically diverse food across our city for our most diverse populations. You know, this is about how we invest through a racial equity lens and making sure that people stay healthy requires food and a place to call home. We've said repeatedly in this budget that in order to stay healthy, you have to stay home. That's the mandate. But far too many people in our city don't have a place to call home. They don't have a place to call home, even for a night, because our shelters are at capacity. And the crisis of living without the ability to have shelter in this moment is manifesting itself on the street. And every one of our neighbors, each one of us as council members, every resident across the city has seen the consequence of years of divestment in affordable housing and years of not sufficient investment in shelter services and the human services necessary to make sure that our outreach efforts and our housing efforts for those who are living unsheltered in our city are sufficient. And right now, we're seeing that play out with more people living in tents and RVs, more people sleeping in the doorways. And this budget makes historic investments in helping those who are living unsheltered in our community. We want to not only help make sure that they have access to the necessary resources, but help get them sheltered and inside. That's what I'm really proud about in this budget. We've invested in tiny homes. We've invested in hotel sheltering. We've invested in non congregate shelter options. Because even the homeless service providers themselves have said that the old ways of congregate shelters are just not working. There's more humane ways, a holistic ways to help make sure that people have the services they need. And our budget makes those historic and necessary investments. We're investing in direct housing as well. And we're doing it through the lens of what the community needs. Everything from making sure that the folks at Africa town have the pre-development costs they need to really invest in the shelter services that will lead to permanent supportive housing, to making sure that our friends at Aurora comments have the funding that they finally have been asking for for so long. We made sure that the $30 million that we had committed to two years ago through the sale of the public land at Mercer Megaplex is maintained. So that $30 million goes directly into communities at the highest risk of displacement. And that's our community of color population. We want to welcome new neighbors coming into our city and be a welcoming city just as much as we want to prevent displacement and gentrification. And this budget makes those investments. We're investing in the housing. We know we need much more, though, and it will require us to work in partnership with the county and also with the state. And I'm really looking forward to having those conversations with the new federal administration, because right now we're at a 40 year historic low in housing investments from our federal government. These issues of housing and homelessness, the crisis of mental health services and the lack of access to comprehensive services cannot just be addressed at the city level alone. And I'm really excited about the partnership that we could potentially have with the new administration to invest in housing, homelessness services and our health services folks in this budget. We have made strides towards actually investing in Green New Deal principles, and we're doing that by making sure that people have access to sidewalks from Rainier. Each to Beacon Hill from 45th Avenue to South Park. Sidewalks. Pedestrian ways. Bike by bike. Friendly avenue. So that people aren't in the street. And we're actually creating protected bikeways across our city. We're making sure that the Green New Deal investments that you all approved through the Jumpstart Progressive Tax legislation has an onramp for 2022. We've invested in making sure that our department's Office of Sustainability and Equity have the ability to get and the environment have the ability to actually ramp up for those Green New Deal investments by also making sure that they have the personnel direct titles that include Green New Deal labels so that we are getting prepared as a city and we're doing major investments and making sure that our buildings are energy efficient. This is what it looks like to make sure that our values as a council are represented in a city budget. And we've made tremendous changes to the proposed budget that came down. I think as folks comb through the budget and I hope you do, thanks to the incredible work of the communications team, you now have excellent tutorials on the screen to show you various components within the budget. I hope you will come through it and see the ways in which this Council has not only stepped up to lead in a moment of crisis, that is the economic downturn and COVID pandemic, but the ways in which these investments are centering communities of color as we think about what it means to be greater sustainability and self-sufficiency, but make sure that we're investing in areas that have been historically underfunded in the past, and let's lift those items in this budget up and recognize what we've done and where we still need to go. I'm really thankful for all of your work as it comes to public safety. I just want to reiterate the important work that we've all done and the historic nature of it. This council set out to really do three things this year shrink the Spd's budget in areas where we knew. We've asked our officers to step into areas of mental health services and case management that we should be actually doing through community. And you all have done that in partnership with the community. We've helped shrink areas where we knew those services could be better served in Health and Human Services in a stand alone department or in community investments. You all have made those reductions possible. We set out to invest in community alternatives. We're investing. It is historic amount in direct community strategies through the participatory budgeting process, through the task force, by making sure that the 10 million that we committed to earlier this year gets directly on to communities. Now, 12 million, actually. You've all made that possible. And the third thing is, we now have also committed to making sure that we're not growing the size of the police department, as we also seek to increase the size and capacity of our community partners. We've helped to make sure that we're scaling up community based programs and services, community based alternatives to addressing harm and making sure that there's a restorative justice pilot program programing for black girls and young women and black queer and trans youth. There's so many pieces that I will let all of you highlight in addition to the ways in which you have helped to pull out mental health services from our traditional public safety model and really make sure that we have our community being treated by those who have those mental health skills and and our firefighters. We have lifted up all of so many investments and all of them. I'll summarize on some of those pieces. We'll talk about the ways in which we've scaled up our our firefighter department by making sure that they have trauma informed counseling, because we know that this year has been tremendously hard and that they have the support that they need to scale up that third health one team. It's been a long year and I will try to not be any more long winded just to say thank you. And it's been a real honor and a privilege to be able to work with all of you. I would be remiss if I didn't get a quick few quick thank you's in Council President, so I don't miss those at the end. Thank you very much to my team chief of staff Erin House Policy Manager Freddie de Cuevas. Staff to our budget committee here. And Aretha Basu, legislative assistant, along with our new intern, Laurie McHugh. Also, thank you to the central to the central staff budget team could not do this work. And I'm just in every day of their skills, their patients and their talent. Ali Panini Chief, Dan Einar, Tom Meisel, Lisa Kay, Patty organ. And the entire. Every single member of the central staff. For all of your expertize or hours or careful analysis and all of the work that you've done on each one of these budget elements, the entire central staff has really been the heroes behind how we have made this budget balance, because let's remember, we received a budget with $3 million in reserves. You all have helped us build that back up to now $40 million. And they had a huge part in that. Thanks again to our clerks who always keep the show running smoothly here, our I.T. system, who's enabled this virtual deliberations to take place , and to our Seattle channel partners who make sure that this information is streamed live and archived for you. Thanks again to our community partners who have continued to provide public testimony, letters, calls. We hear you. We see you. And we will continue to work with all of you as we take additional steps to help make sure our city is healthy, housed and safe on our road to a more equitable economy. It's been a privilege and it's been an honor. And I look forward to wrapping this up with all of you as we think about the next steps that lay in front of us. Thank you. Councilmember Macheda I did get a message from Councilmember Morales that she would like to make comments and then I just saw councilmember verbal tango to Councilman Morales. If you are ready and available, happy to recognize you. And if not, I can go on. Great. What else? Please. You're. You are. You're recognized for your. Thank you. I won't be too long. I appreciate that. I do want to thank everybody, colleagues, we have had some heated debate over the last few months as we try to navigate a budget that reflects our economic realities, but also trying to deliver for the residents of Seattle. So and I want to say that thanks to our work this summer to pass the Jumpstart legislation, we've added we have additional revenue for COVID relief, and we're able to prevent the kind of austerity budget that I think we're all really fearing as we moved into the mode here. Council's really made significant steps and I'm proud of our work together and I look forward to continuing our work in 2021. I also want to thank the extraordinary organizing and advocacy of frontline workers, community stakeholders and advocates. I'm proud of the work that we've done together as a council, and I want to say I feel proud that I was able to use this very privileged position to bring the voices of District two into the halls of power. This council listened and through this budget process really delivered by taking serious steps to address homelessness, dismantling and replacing the navigation team, laying the foundation for a more humane and a more responsive approach to homelessness engagement. The HOPE Program will be expert led will expand outreach to unhoused neighbors across the city. We'll finally offer investments in hotels to ensure non congregate shelter, especially right now is being covered. We've also expanded city hygiene services for unhoused neighbors with 63 new public sinks coming and regular trash pickup for residents of 13 additional encampments. We committed $30 million to a new participatory budget process that will prioritize community members interests in how our community's safety resources are spent. And we made significant progress in shifting how we fund the Seattle Police Department with this 2021 budget proposal. We're investing in alternatives to policing. As was already mentioned, safety, coordinator's, health, one expansion. We're putting in a $6 million in vacancy savings and added the 2 million more this morning. So I think we've I will say again that increasing police staffing wrongly presumes that they can fill the roles of nurses and social workers and housing specialists . I think our commitment this morning is a strong indication of the work that we have done and the work that we know we still have to do. As I said before, I don't believe there is no research to prove. More officers on patrol equals community increase community safety, especially when we know that 2020 has been really hard for our neighbors for so many reasons. I'm excited that with today's vote we rejected the premise that more officers equals more safety. This budget, we mark an important turn investing in a new paradigm, health and safety. And I'm really proud of that. Also want to thank South End advocates. Folks, indeed you. See. $7 million in mobility investments, including sidewalk repairs and Rainier Beach and Beacon Hill and the completion, or at least the beginning of construction of the Georgetown the South Park Trail have three additional outreach workers to support our homeless neighbors in the South End and the $550,000 invested in the restorative justice pilot program at South Bend Schools. I do want to thank as well everyone in our Legislative Department for helping me navigate what has been an extraordinarily crazy year. The new council member. I've been really thankful to the policy and budget expertize on our central staff, and I want to give a special shout out to Greg Doss. Who. Somebody, Mr. Klein, that guy, so that he can take a break because he's been working so hard on all of our behalf. So thank you to Greg and the entire central staff, our communications team, who turn our ideas into easily digestible posts and visuals that support all of us with making sure that our community knows the work that we're doing and that he clerks who more than once helped set me straight on procedural rules. Thank you very much. And of course, the folks in I.T. who have helped all of us learn how to navigate new platforms, how to do my checks, how to deal with bandwidth constraints. Thank you all for really stepping up in this new, new virtual world. I want to thank again the community advocates and stakeholders, especially my constituents in District two, brought us budget proposals, pushed us to stretch our thinking and who continue to hold us accountable for delivering on our commitments to build a more equitable Seattle. And finally, I have to thank my staff, Alexis Charla, who is clearly the budget maven in my office, in my staff. There's a touch who always reminds us to make sure that we're including young people in our deliberations and Silverdale who make sure we do the same for our homeless neighbors. He's a farmer who is always making sure that our public safety and transportation priorities are are being met as well as our interns. Mihalic, Mr. Bonnie, Kari and Ezekiel Augustine. All been rock stars in managing these processes while also working really hard to keep up with constituent calls. And we were able to accomplish so much this year. I'm really proud of this team and I'm really proud of the work that we've been able to do this year. Thanks, everyone. Thank you, Councilmember Morales. Next in the queue is Councilmember Herbold and then Councilmember Sala. Thank you so much. Just some overall statements. And then I just want to lift up some of the individual budget actions as well. In response to widespread community advocacy in Seattle and throughout the country, in response to the murder of George Floyd last summer and generations of activism prior to that in the face of injustice and harm at the hands of police officers. The Council began work on a new approach towards public safety, an approach that does not assume that more officers means more safety. This budget charts the next steps, which will continue into 2021 and beyond. The budget includes unprecedented investments in alternatives to policing and reductions in the police department budget. It creates the Community Safety and Communication Center. This is a major step forward in the city's ability to reimagine policing and deliver city services that meets the needs of all of the community. Shifting nine one dispatch out of SPD, it also shifts out and asks the executive to look at expanding the role of parking enforcement officers. Perhaps we should start considering a different name for the role of these critical workers. It adds crisis responders and adds a new health one unit health too. Thanks to the leadership of Budget Chair Mosqueda and in line with the Council's action last summer, transfer victim advocates to the Human Services Department. Thank you, Councilmember Strauss. And from a total of 197 officer positions in the adopted 2021 budget sorry, in the adopted 2020 budget today the Budget Committee acted to adjust the funding in line with the number of positions SPD will be able to fill based on up to date information on separations with funding for three 1343 FTE ease with a request for an additional 35 out of order layoffs. Council has expressed a. Clear desire for up to date information with monthly updates on speedy staffing and use of overtime, as well as reporting on traffic stops, including racial disparities and recommendations on training and policy changes to address this. As far as the value of the SBB transfers and cuts, the 911 and people transfer and the transfer of victim advocates to HST total, a $37 million reduction in the SPD budget and the SPD staffing and related cuts directly to CPD is up to $42 million, including the provisos. So that is that is nearly an $80 million reduction in the SPD budget. Again, including provisos, transfers and cuts. The budget itself follows. Through on commitments to reimagine community safety and build and scale up alternatives to policing. It ensures that commitments made in previous years are honored. It funds the was. 10 million. In investments to community safety that Council provided in 2020. And this morning we added an additional 2 million as a result of the additional $2 million cut in committee this morning. This will result in $12 million for the Human Services Department to get out the door following a community engagement process to inform the request for proposals for these funds and expects to make awards by quarter one 2021. It clarifies that investment should move the city's community safety strategy towards a public health centered harm reduction model of restorative justice, crime prevention, and ameliorating the harm caused by the criminal legal system to individuals and communities most impacted. The budget also restores over $1 million to the Seattle Office for Civil Rights, for organizations pursuing alternatives to or addressing harms caused by the criminal legal system that were awarded grant funding through the 2020 collaborative grant making process. This funding was the result of years of advocacy by community groups that resulted in the Council unanimously passing a resolution for zero use of youth detention in 2015, and the funds were meant to be an ongoing annual investment. It restores the $30 million to the Strategic Investment Fund to address displacement in areas significant, significant risks. Thank you to the leadership of Councilmember Sargeant in this area. And it provides $30 million for a participatory budgeting process that will fund alternative public safety models and programs. Building on the 3 million that council provided in 2020 for Community Research into Community Safety, which is currently underway through the Black Brilliance Project, this budget action is funded through cuts to the SPD budget in 2021, and I think we all, all council members who introduced reductions can really take a lot of pride in that. Those actions have led to this $30 million for participatory budgeting. As far as some other actions that I think are important to this budget. I want to just lift up funding to reverse cuts of the fire department exams and reverse a cut of 20 officer I'm sorry, 20 firefighters from the fire department recruit class, adding funding to the fire department to fund automated external defibrillators, Lucas devices and ballistic sets. Making sure that we are doing a better job tracking overtime and off duty work, working to to fund the South Park public safety coordinator, and then also working to ensure that we get good reporting on the West Seattle Bridge repair work, as well as implementation of the Reconnect with Seattle program, which is Dot's mitigation program to fund projects that address the impacts of West Seattle detours on communities like Highland Park and South Park. We funded resources for the Landlord Liaison Program. We added funds to maintain family rapid rehousing case loads to ensure families don't fall back into homelessness. We've restored funding for the age friendly Seattle program, and we've included funding both to permit contracting with public health for services recommended by the 2016 Heroin and Prescription Opiate Addiction Task Force, as well as increased funding for services and harm reduction programs at social service agencies that serve people who use drugs daily, allowing them to expand hours , increase staff, expand to additional locations. We've also included funds for alternatives specifically to I'm sorry, I'm losing track here. We've included funds for outreach to people experiencing homelessness with some geographically focused services within District one. And I also want to shout out that the West Seattle Longhouse Crossing Project is fully funded in this budget with. $2.8 million to be included for the funding in addition to the funding that we, the Council, provided last year. We also included funding for the Social Service Provider Academy. And then lastly, I should have spoken to this during item 414 one to make sure that the viewing public knows that we also acted on legislation approving issuance of bonds, including an authorization for 100 million in bond financing for the West Seattle Bridge. The Council earlier adopted a $70 million fund loan to provide short term funding for the West Seattle Bridge and related work. And the bond sale will pay back $70 million to the internal funding source and provide 30 million in additional funding. Many, many thanks to my colleagues, especially to the vision and leadership of Budget Chair Mascara, who had a vision for a no austerity budget. Many thanks to the hard work of central staff in my staff. Christina Cut, Sebas Aldrich, Alex Clardy and as well. My heartfelt gratitude to the activism of decriminalize Seattle King County Equity now in the tens of thousands of people who contacted my office and marched in the street and testified in many hours of council public comment. Again, this work is just beginning and I commit to continue to work with you in this this exercise in re-envisioning how we can promote a structure for community safety that benefits all of our communities. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Herbold, for those remarks. Really appreciate it. As far as salons and then again, colleagues, because Salon is the last person I have who has indicated he or she would like to speak. So if you'd like to, please do let me know. Councilmember Strauss and then Councilmember Lewis got you all down and then Councilmember Peterson does more silent floor resource. Thank you. I will be voting yes on the group of Council amendments to the budget, but voting no on the budget as a whole. So I'm voting yes on item 35 and on item 36, which is the budget as a whole. I want to first convey my thank you for the tremendous and dedicated work by the City Council Central Staff on the proposals from my office and the People's Budget. Danny Dyer. Ali Banerjee. Tracy Radcliffe. Asha Bianca Drummond. Greg Doss. Geoff Simms. Amy Gore, Calvin Chao, Lisa Kay and Tom Mike. So thank you all. Thank you to all the community organizers and socialists who work in my council office, to all the organizers and Socialist Alternative and all the activists who have participated in the People's Budget Movement. As in previous years, since 2014, the people's budget movement and this year, along with the Solidarity Budget, has won important victories for working people. We restored funding for the Green New Deal Oversight Board and the $30 million Anti Displacement Fund, both unfulfilled promises from Mayor Durkan. We are one. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding for rental rights, organizing and eviction. Defense. Millions of dollars for three new dining halls, villages and funding for Nicole. Small and share meals, self-managed villages and funds for 24 hour homeless shelters. We want the beginning steps to pass transferable rent or background check legislation and standard lease legislation ordinances that my office will be bringing next year which, if passed, will have a major impact on renters rights. And we want the initial pre-development funds for Africa Downs project to develop a full city block of affordable housing in the heart of the Central District. Over the summer, tens of thousands of people flooded the streets of Seattle and over 20 million across the country to protest pervasive and ongoing police violence. These protests also captured the frustration with a society that offers little to the majority of working people and youth, a society that is riddled with crises, the pandemic , the recession and a dead end economy for many young people. It was a real testament to the power of that movement in the summer that seven of the nine Seattle City Council members committed to defunding the police by 50% at that time. And it is because of thousands of people speaking up from the people's budget and the Solidarity Budget and because the movement has its unwavering voice through my Socialist Council office that we have now won $31 million or 8.2% reduction in the police budget, not counting the mechanisms like moving the costs of parking enforcement out of the police department. We do not honestly represent actual cuts. And those millions of dollars of reduction are translating into available dollars for community programs and services. But taken as a whole, the budget the Democratic Party council members are going to approve today is a budget that deeply feels working people and marginalized communities, including working class and poor communities of color in the middle of a pandemic and a spike in COVID infections in the context of the worst recession for working people since the Great Depression. Democratic Council members will be carrying out brutal austerity. It is true that the city council's budget reduces slightly the size of the cuts proposed in Mayor Durkin's budget. But still, the Council is allowing almost $200 million to be cut from affordable housing, bus hours, parks and libraries. Funding for affordable housing has been cut from 131 million in 2020 to only $84 million in 2021, a cut of over a third to affordable housing while homelessness balloons out of control across the city. Funding for transportation has been cut by almost $100 million. Those cuts include millions more busses and tens of millions for essential maintenance and construction of our transportation infrastructure. And starting in April, the grocery voucher program that thousands of families have relied on will expire. For over two months, my gone to the office and working people organizing with the People's Budget asked council members, Will you make big business pay for the crisis? I put the burden on working people and communities of color. We know the answer now, and unfortunately it is not a surprising one. This is par for the course for the Democratic establishment. Not one single Democratic Council member was willing to support the people's budget and my office's proposal to approve a tiny increase in the Amazon tax that would have stopped all of the budget cuts. Corporations like Amazon, F5 networks and Starbucks have just reported staggering third quarter profits. Amazon alone has made $11.5 billion Billion with a B dollars in profits just since April. In other words, throughout the pandemic so far, instead of a tiny increase in the tax on these pandemic profiteers, the Democrats are choosing to put the burden of the crisis on ordinary people. Democratic Council members have shockingly claimed that this is an anti austerity budget, but that is simply a lie. The City Council's current proposed budget does reduce slightly the size of the vicious cuts proposed in Mel Dawkins budget. But there are still, as I said, almost $200 million being cut. They have made the bald faced claim, for example, that there are no cuts to parks while at the same time. Just a few minutes ago, voting for an ordinance that gives the city the legal authority to cut the Parks Department budget. On the other hand, the introduction to the mayor's proposed budget says, quote, spending reductions were necessary and quote, and this is how big business and the political establishment has always approached recessions. You will catch them either engaging in obfuscation and simply pretending that the budget cuts don't exist, or claiming that there is no alternative to draconian cuts to public infrastructure and essential services while the biggest corporations continue to absorb record profits. Part of my job as an elected representative of working people and as a Socialist City Council member is to expose the lies of the political establishment. As you can see, the claim that this is an anti austerity budget is the latest such blatant falsehood. It is true that the Council's budget amendments, which I have supported, have prevented the budgetary layoffs of City of Seattle workers. But that is only because the overwhelming majority of the budget cuts differ or eliminate public works like construction and maintenance projects that the city contracts out to be done by workers who are not directly employed by the city. Even a simple back of the envelope calculation shows clearly that these cuts will result in hundreds of layoffs and cancel job creation, if not more, which in turn will deepen the recession. We need to be expanding public jobs program, like in the New Deal that the labor movement led by socialists won in the 1930s by putting ferocious pressure on FDR. We do not need to slash public investments. We should be expanding the Green New Deal jobs program, not cutting infrastructure maintenance, as our movement has said. Austerity budgets are anti-worker, anti-union and I people of color, Democratic Council members even refuse to support our movement's proposal to develop legislation for an elected community oversight board with power to hold the police accountable. Every single Democrat voted against accountability. This is the eighth time I am voting on Seattle City budget and never before have there been more lessons for the activists and organizers of social movements than have been revealed this year. Throughout history, it has been movements that make progressive change, not the machinations of the political establishment, not electing the smartest technocrats and not the relationships between elected officials. Real change is driven by the balance of power in society as a whole, and particularly the organized forces of the working class prepare to fight. Two years ago I was the only no vote as the council approved the police contract, rolling back accountability and increased funding to the Seattle Police Department by tens of millions. Last year, with just me voting no. All Democrats then passed a special bill to provide hiring bonuses for new police officers. Now, after the Justice for George Floyd movement, many of the same councilmembers have voted in favor of $31 million reduction in police different police budget. What made the Democrats take even this limited step was the pressure of the movement. Similarly, had it not been for the powerful tax Amazon movement over the summer, there would be an additional $214 million of a hole in the budget in the first half of 2020. The tax Amazon movement mobilized hundreds, perhaps thousands of community activists and organizers. We held mass organizing conferences, which elected a coordinating committee that was held accountable to the rank and file where community members voted democratically on both the policy and the strategy to win. And those volunteers create gathered 30,000 signatures on the tax Amazon ballot initiative. And with the threat of a ballot initiative hanging over the heads of big business and the political establishment, we won this historic legislation. Members of the public may have noticed that I never used the phrase, quote unquote, jumpstart to refer to the Amazon tax. That is because that language is designed and approved by big business to try and erase that unprecedented role of the grassroots nostrum on movement from the history of our victory. You can see the. Pictures and videos of the DAX Amazon movement and hundreds participating in mass meeting. After mass meeting. There are no pictures of a movement called Jumpstart because there was no such movement. Only a watered down proposal passed under pressure from our movement. And it is essential that we recognize the vital role of the movement in these victories, which otherwise would not have happened. If we, as working people do not, then our future demands will fail. We should recognize and claim every victory our grassroots movements win. And I voted for every progressive budget amendment in this budget. But those victories continue to be on the margins of the budget. While the majority of the budget is an austerity budget, placing the burden of the COVID emergency, climate, emergency, homelessness, emergency and economic recession onto the shoulders of regular working people rather than big business and the rich. For those reasons, I will be voting no on this brutal austerity budget. Our movement needs to carry forward serious and sober lessons from this year and come back next year to fight renewed battles for COVID relief and a guaranteed jobs program to cancel rent and mortgages for those affected by COVID. To defend the Amazon tax against what will be round two of attempts by the Democratic establishment to pass a statewide ban on municipal big business taxes and for an elected community oversight board with full powers to hold the police accountable. But to win any of this, we will need movements, and the leadership of the movement will need to be independent of the political establishment. Okay. Councilmember Mosqueda, I think you wanted an opportunity to respond to some of those. Colorful comments. I'm I'm happy to allow for that to happen. I do have three other council members who are in the queue. So if there's no objection, I'm happy to allow that to happen. And so this proud Democrat is happy to recognize my Democrat favorite Democrat. Hey, thanks so. Much for playing on the council, please. Thank you very much, Madam President. You know, I just think it's really important that we recognize the work of the folks who really organize to pass the just aren't progressive payroll tax. I recognized when we did this this summer the movement of the tax Amazon folks and the gears that folks have been talking about this, no question . Well, let's remember the entire coalition that came together around Jumpstart that included communities of color, that included workers of color, that included small businesses. This is important to remember because it is absolutely false. It is a lie to say that anything related to Jumpstart was drafted by big business. Not true. And I just want to make sure that that's abundantly clear, that we have integrity as we talk about it, and that we recognize that this was people coming together to build on years of advocacy that I have also acknowledged. But we passed something collectively as a council that did bring in the 214 million. And we did this with a broad coalition that helped come up with not just the name, but the entire proposal. And I'm incredibly proud of that. Work is not something that large businesses supported by any means nor were nor were the work of the. Communities of color. Housing advocates. Green New Deal advocates. The folks who fought for environmental protections and homelessness services. All of the pieces that we got in there is a really, really robust effort. And I don't want their work to be erased by one person's words and a revision of history. So thanks again to everybody who did work on passing the Jumpstart Progressive Payroll Tax. Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, for those comments. In the queue we have councilmember strauss followed by councilmember lewis and then councilmember peterson casmir strauss. Thank you. Council President Thank you. Colleagues, I am really proud to see this budget before us, including my my priorities for food access, tenant protections, addressing homelessness, addressing climate crisis and investing in trees and in increasing our access to transit as well. I just want to start off by saying I wasn't going to mention this, but I am really glad that we have limited the lay off of city employees expanding housing, food and economic stimulus to Seattle residents. The council's budget prevents us against austerity. Budgeting, restorations and investments are included in this budget to stop cuts to government services and public sector workers who provide those services. Every budgetary layoff that was planned in the proposed budget has been replenished so that we ensure that the core services in critical areas, especially to our most vulnerable in times of crisis, are. Are invested in that. We continue those core government services in critical areas. The council's budget takes this anti-austerity approach. It builds back on all of the proposed cuts and it even builds back the reserves to around the Great Recession emergency reserve levels. Replenishing these emergency reserves just as jumpstart, spend, plan and vision. So I'm very proud of the overall work and wasn't expected to make those comments and. Proud and stand by them. Regarding regarding food access, I'm really glad that this budget has invested in the FreshBooks program. We decreased the waitlist incredibly, and I'm thankful for the additional emergency food assistance that is moving faster than expected. Also requesting that Office of Economic Development develop strategies to cut red tape to support farmers markets, bringing the farm to our market here in the city and adding to aid for the Special Events Program lead position to ensure that those farmers market support work is accomplished. Regarding my tent priorities for tenants adding money to Stsci for ten outreach education services. Not only adding those dollars for those education services, we added staff to C.I. for Tenant Outreach and Property Owner Assistance Group, and then also with SDI setting the reporting guidelines to ensure that STSCI permit processes times improve over this next year. For Homelessness Bringing Homelessness outreach services dedicated to District six and other districts across the city. Increasing the funding from the mobile crisis teams. Who are the first responders for behavioral health? Nine on one calls increasing behavioral health and substance use outreach for D six and across the city to invest up upstream and decrease nine on one calls for behavioral health, as that is what is often called in as disturbance in budgeting the budget overall, investing in housing in appropriate shelter because we know that outreach is only as successful as the shelter and housing resources we have available for climate. My budget proposal amendment was an thank you to everyone involved. Restored the Climate Advisor position. We also requested Seattle Public Utilities to explore the expansion of the Tree Ambassador program, and I'm very grateful for Councilmember Peterson bringing forward the tree statement of legislative intent, as well as partnering with Councilmember Peterson for transit on the transit multimodal corridor and ensuring that we can get that overpass over I-5 that is pedestrian friendly. Also, thank you to everyone who and Councilmember Lewis for taking up the mantle on Thomas Street Market. Mohi Smith, Coach Park. Another one of my priorities jobs and representation. So ensuring that OPD has dollars to support workforce development opportunities and that our census outreach engagement position is retained so that we're able to follow up with community insurance. Not the outreach is not just a one time experience. Rather that we ensure it is a relationship. Again, the Council budget overall focused on economic recovery, housing, health, community safety and addressing the climate crisis. So I just want to take a moment to thank you, Chair Mesquita and Sigal, for shepherding this process. We could not have done this without central staff. Thank you. Big thank you to Dan Allen Calvert, Greg, Yolanda. Tom, Lisa, Jeff. Brian, Carina. Carlos Lish, Ketel. Asha, Eric, Amy, Tracy and Patty. If I missed something, I'm going to be in a lot of trouble to our clerks. Monica, Joni Emilia. When that Traci Thao, Liz, Kris and Joel. And of course, we couldn't do this in this day and age without our information technology and sun, Eric and Bren comms. We couldn't do this if we're not communicating with folks Dana, Stephanie and Joseph and of course the folks on my team, Leena, Amanda, Peter and my budget lead know I could not have done this without you. So again, thank you, colleagues, for all your hard work in this unprecedented year. This budget addresses Seattle's immediate needs and invests in our future. I'm excited to stand with you today. Thank you, Councilmember Strauss, for those comments. Next up is Councilmember Lewis and then Councilmember Peterson. Thank you. Madam President, I will be brief in my remarks, but I want to start at the top. Following the lead of my colleagues and thanking everybody here at the department who was able to help bring this budget together and bring this budget together in a professional and progressive way for the final product we have ended up with. I want to say at the top really profoundly thank my staff Campbell Brown, Jacob Thorpe, Parker Dawson and Daniel Suarez. Without you guys, I couldn't do this work and really appreciate your commitment throughout this really difficult year and also throughout this budget process. In pivoting to talking about some of the specific items, I wanted to start at the top just by recognizing a recent comment from Danny West, Nate, that I thought really summarized the leadership of this council over this really difficult year that started off with Everybody loves to welcome the Seattle City Council, but when everybody was fiddling around waiting for somebody else to do some COVID 19 relief, Seattle acted. And I think we could also apply that similarly to restructuring public safety in a more equitable way, or towards making sure that even in times of crisis, we are planning for the future on climate resiliency and a Green New Deal, or making sure that we are still advancing tax equity. When a lot of critics told us that we couldn't pass Jumpstart or that we shouldn't pass jump start, this council acted and that action has allowed us to respond to the myriad of crises and challenges that 2020 has put in our way. And I do want to comment on a couple of things that I'm particularly excited about. I'm for District seven, District seven, which is overwhelmingly majority renter. We increased renter support and I want to thank Councilmember Swan for bringing that forward and was proud to sponsor increased legal representation for renters and increased support for renters, increased information and workshops so that renters know their rights, which is more critical than ever. I want to recognize the 545 additional transitional shelter spaces that we will be putting in our system almost a 20% increase in transitional shelter. And just for the record, those are shelter spaces with four walls of door that locks shelter spaces that guarantee dignity and privacy to the people who stay in them, and shelter spaces that have never been more necessary for people not only to have that quality of life that so many of us take for granted, but also to be able to secure in place and respond to the dynamics of the COVID emergency. The maintained funding for Thomas Street in District seven. A critical investment for East West connection for bikes and pedestrians is something I am very happy to to carry the torch for continuing the work of my predecessor, Sally Bagshaw, and the work of Council Strauss and his former position as the legislative assistant here in the Department. The preservation of critical positions and the Economic Development Office that will guide our recovery related to nightlife, related to maritime jobs, and related to farmers markets. These are critical investments. And of course, the significant investments, the scale and expand police alternatives like health one and two, re-envision and expand the role of parking enforcement officers to be more of a community civil civil service officer in line with models of public safety that a lot of other cities in the United States and Western Europe have adopted. And there's still more work that needs to be done. And I just want to finish by saying that if 2020 was a year with lots of challenges, it is my hope that we are setting the stage for a 2021 that is going to see Seattle bounce back in a significant and strong way based on the assets that we are putting into the community through this budget, that we will have a serious and determined administration in Washington, D.C. with the incoming Biden-Harris administration to be a partner in expanding our infrastructure support, in taking the public health emergency of COVID seriously, and being a partner in our relief efforts that we have led on as a city council, that there will be a vaccine rollout, that the city and King County and the Board of Health will have a role in to facilitate a strong recovery over the course of next year and finally have a federal policy that will mirror our local one in grappling with this virus in a serious way, that we will have a legislative session from our partners in Olympia that will finally get more resources from the state in play to assist our efforts here, not only in the COVID and economic response, but also in progressive new legislation that only the state legislature can pass to help strengthen this council's actions on building a new system of public safety that is equitable and responsive to community demand. And of course, the opportunity to negotiate a new and equitable contract with smog, which will be expiring at the end of this year and which will dominate a lot of the discussions going. These. Things in 2021. Give me hope that we were getting all this out of the way early in 2020 and that we can really set the stage with this budget. Chair Mesquita And thank you for your leadership on putting this together. It really makes sure that 2021 is going to be a year of action, and it's going to be a year where we get a lot of these assets into the field and to do the work that we know needs to be done. And I look forward to voting on this today and to moving forward to preparing for the stage of the oversight and the implementation of these critical initiatives. And I know that we have a good team here, not only in terms of our colleagues on the council, but also our central staff and everyone else here in the department who has done such a good job to bring this together and move us forward. So would that I have no additional comments. Thank you so much and look forward to voting on this. Thank you, Councilmember Lewis, for those comments. Next up is Councilmember Peterson. And again, colleagues, if any one else would like to make comments, please do let me know. And we in tradition and consistent with the rules. Councilmember Mosquito will have the last word to close out debate today. But next up is Councilmember Peterson. Thank you, council president and a special thanks to our budget chair, Teresa Mesquita and her team for their leadership during this fall's budget process. And to our city budget office and all the department heads who worked on this Budget Council central staff. So their hard work also our city clerks and Seattle channel for putting us on TV to communicate to our constituents. And I want to thank my team Ma'lik, Willa, Toby, Kara, Sienna and all the constituents who contacted our office about the city budget. Finalizing a budget always feels like a big accomplishment, and especially given this year's challenges a pandemic, a recession, a racial reckoning, the homelessness crisis, the West Seattle Bridge closure, and an antagonistic Trump administration. I believe the amended budget has both positives and negatives, and I believe it's important for my constituents that I acknowledge both. First, some of the concerns. I'm concerned this budget shortchanges average infrastructure. I don't think it fully revamps public safety with a plan. I don't feel like we have enough accountability for our response to homelessness. And I'm concerned that we're giving city government a pay raise, a pay increase, instead of investing more in our most marginalized communities. But this budget benefits every district, including District four. And the budget process was fair, thanks to the diplomacy of our Budget Committee chair. No budget is perfect. Our constituents have diverse and conflicting views. A budget with both positives and negatives is a natural result. And finally, people are yearning for a functional government. It's a budget does not pass. Nothing gets done. So after weighing both the positives emanate. It's I will be voting yes. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Peterson. Are there any other comments from any of my other colleagues? Nope. All right, Councilmember Juarez, thank you for confirming that you don't have any additional comments to add. I'll just be really brief. We we are spending some time in our newsletter, in my office and via our social media, highlighting the priorities that we had in my office around climate resilience, directing investments towards bipoc communities, including restoration of full funding for the legal defense network, and increased investments in housing and homelessness, particularly around rental assistance for families with school aged children and folks who have disabilities. And of course, much of the work related to public safety has already been discussed by many of my colleagues on the city council. So I'm not going to belabor those points. I do want to say thank you to Chair Mosquito for a very difficult job here. I think when she was talking to me as a future council president and advocating for an opportunity to be the the budget chair, I don't think she did that advocacy in the context of realizing that we were going to be facing a massive economic recession amidst a global pandemic. And and in the middle of all of it, a racial reckoning that has shaken the world, including our city. So thank you for your leadership in that regard. Huge thanks to also the council, central staff, clerk's office communications and yes, even our h.r. And operations folks who keep keep us running quietly in the background. So thanks to everybody for all the work that you've done during very trying, trying times. So I'm not going to belabor any of my priorities. I wanted to say just a few thank you's and I wanted to in the spirit of keeping things interesting, I wanted to read you all a quick little haiku that my office has written dedicated to all of you. And it reads, You all did a great job. You know who the real ones are? Team around out. Councilmember Skinner, you have the last word. Thank you very much, council president. I will just. So thanks once more. Once again, it's been an honor. It's been a privilege. And it's it's not over. We have a lot of work to do, and I know that that will continue for this year and into next year and early in our deliberation. I do want to take the opportunity to thank Ben Noble, our budget director at CBO, for all of their work in their time with the staff that he has made available to us. I appreciate all the work that the Senate Budget Office has done, and I want to read into the record the names of all of the central staff. I know that council members have already mentioned a number of names, but thanks again to interim director, urban eater supervisor Alec Nucci and Calvin Chao, Greg Doss. Brian Goodnight. Eric Makani. Carina Ball. Asha Lincoln. Matron Cato Freeman. Amy Gore. Yolanda Ho. Jeff Sims. Lish Woodson. Tracey Ratcliffe. Lisa Kay. Tom Meisel, Carlos Lugo and anybody else that I missed. Patty Morgan deserves a huge shout out for getting us all prepared every day. Thank you very much for all of your work to make these documents possible. And with that, appreciate all of you. Much more work to come. Thank you for all of your hard work. Thank you so much, Councilmember Mesquita, for those closing remarks. And without further ado, we're going to go ahead and move through the remainder of our agenda. We move very quickly through items once reserved for. But we all knew that there'd be a little little bit of a pause as we consider items 35 and 36 as as usual . So thank you to everybody for your comments and for in engaging in this conversation. Items 35 and 36 folks will I am going to now ask that the clerk allow us to continue to proceed with voting on these two items. And the first item on the agenda is clerk filed 314464. Will the court please call the rule on approving and placing the clerk file on file? Morales. Yes. Mosquera Hi. Petersen Yes. So what? Yes. Strauss Yes. Herbold Yes. R.S. Yes. Lewis Yes. President Gonzalez. Yes. Nine in favor, nine opposed. Thank you so much. All right. The motion carries and the Kirk file is approved and placed on file. Item 36. This is Council Bill 119938. We have already had debate and discussion, as I mentioned. So will the clerk please call the roll on the passage of the bill? Morales s. Macheda. Yes. Peterson? Yes. Sergeant? No. Strauss. Yes. HERBOLD. Yes. Suarez. Yes. Lewis. Yes. President Gonzalez. Yes. Eight in favor. One opposed. Thank you so much. The bill passes and the chair will sign it. Will the clerk please affix my signature to the legislation on my behalf? We just have a few more items, colleagues, to get through before we adjourn. As a reminder, we still have a Parks District meeting. Yay! Besides that, we're talking now. Now I've got Councilmember Suarez's attention. We have a Parks District meeting immediately following full council. So. So just keep that. Keep that in mind. Perhaps I should have had that reminder before the comments started coming out. Items. But I do want to thank our I.T. Department, who's going to be with us once again till the very, very, very, very end of this process. Nobody would know what we were doing if it wasn't for I.T. department helping us make this possible along with sales channels. So items 37 and 38.

Item 22 Communication from Councilwoman Price Councilmember Peers Recommendation to direct the City Manager to work with economic development and public works to assess the feasibility of funding an electric electric shuttle service or Free Ride program to transport people from Belmont Shore to Second and PCH into Los Alamitos Bay Landing. Thank you, Councilman Price. Thank you. I'm glad to be bringing this item tonight before my colleagues and I ask for your support. East Long Beach has been seeing major investments in business and as a result, we are anticipating major increases in visitors coming to the area to enjoy the businesses and the beautiful corners of the city. Recently, we have seen Ballast Point become a major draw as a brewery and restaurants, bringing more people to Alba Alamitos Bay landing in addition to the existing businesses in the landing like boat house on the bay. We are also seeing San Pedro Fish Market coming to this area in September, which is a huge regional draw that will add to the activity of the crab pot and sooner or later. Not to mention the second PCH project is coming online in October of 2019. So for all of these reasons, it's essential that we develop some creative ways of better managing the movements of people who want to spend time there and transfer to the Belmont Shore and Naples business corridors. All of these areas are constrained by parking and traffic impacts. So what we can do as a city to make it easier to move people through these areas is essential for us to consider and explore. We saw the successful use of the free rides in downtown and we have seen the first Fridays shuttle work well.

Destined for Greatness program and accept grant funding in the amount not to exceed 26,492 for the period of March 1st, 2017 through February 28th, 2018, citywide. Thank you, Councilman Mongo. I think it's great that we are accepting grant funds. Just a point of clarification. Do we typically have every single grant come before this council or do we have an acceptance policy of amounts under a certain amount? I know that sometimes accepting grants or providing the letter of acceptance can be a barrier. And I want to make sure that we don't ever miss out. On money because of it. Thank you, Councilmember. That's a good question. We do have policies in place to allow city staff in many cases to apply for those grants and be very responsive and quick. However, the council does have the responsibility to accept any grant award and also to authorize. So you always see every grant when it's time to accept the awards and to authorize the city manager to sign the documents. Okay. We might want to explore providing department had the discretion up to a certain amount to accept funds so that we can make sure to be able to do that in the future. But at this time, I hope that everyone will be supportive of this opportunity to take the. $26,000. And use our much needed programs. Thank you. Councilman Mungo's, any public comment on item number ten saying none. And Vice Mayor, if I may, we have to make a quick adjustment to the recommendation. Kelly Colletti. Yeah. So the reason this was pulled from consent is that the that the time frame of the contract was changed. And so with the original term of the agreement was to run from March 1st, 2017 through February 28, 2018. However, we recently notified that the term had been shortened by two months. So it's the same amount of money, the same services. But the term now for the grant will be from March 1st, 2017 through December 31, 2017. Perfect. Is that amended motion accepted? Sure.

And the reason why is in the oral part of the process, you really want to delve down to a level of granularity that will inform the panel members. And so to play this out, in the case of what's in front of us tonight, the panel might want to select to ask specific questions about somebodys background with their financing, specific questions about their abilities, that of businesses they've run in the past. Specific questions if they even know what's in their application or simply wrote a check to a third party to write the application. In this way, what we're doing is we're really digging down. So I would encourage you and see the time assured. I hope you allow me a few seconds extra for that process before, but I encourage you to a ask staff to name the fifth person in the voting from what department so we can understand. I certainly hope it would not be the chief of police back into the process as spoken to before. Secondly, I would ask that, is this a normal RFP process line that the city shall refrain from conducting outside research, or is it unique to cannabis RFP if it is standard boilerplate language that scares me for the city, if it's unique to the RFP for cannabis, I'd be very interested as to why. And lastly, I'd encourage you to open up the questioning to be not only the same questions for everybody, but allow the selected panel to delve in as they think is best. So I was able to do it in 6 minutes. Anyway, thank you very much. Thank you. Brian Bradley and the Bill Read. That evening. My name is Brian Bradley. I am the chief laboratory officer for Steep Hill, a cannabis testing laboratory. My wife and I recently moved to Alameda, but we lived in Alameda in the 1980s and 1990s. We bought our first house here. Our kids went to Otis Elementary School. My wife taught school at Saint Philip Neri. We consider ourselves. Longtime Alameda residents have just been separated for some period of time when we come back home. The reason we left was because my job left. And the reason we're coming back is because Steep Hill is looking at Alameda as the site for a new laboratory. I've never been a cannabis user in my life, but I believe that the attempts to ban cannabis, like the attempts to ban alcohol, caused more problems than it solved. Steep hill is primarily in the business to help regulate and make cannabis products safe for the end consumer. That's our sole job. We work with the state to set up regulations. We work with the state to help enforce the regulations. We would love to make our company a part of the Alameda community. We found a potential laboratory site in Marina Village. It's been empty for about 8 to 10 years. We want to recondition it and use it for our own. That takes some significant amount of time. And as you've already referenced, the state has deadlines set up for when they need operations to start. We want to comply with whatever RFP process that you put in place. We just find ourselves in a significant time constraint trying to be able to comply with the state and with the process that you want to put in place. So believe me, we would love to become part of your community. We expect to hire approximately 200 people in the first year of operation and probably a total of 400 by the time we're fully staffed. Right now, we have 10% of our employees as Alameda residents and another 41% as residents of the East Bay as a whole. We expect to be we currently have average salaries of about 85,000, but we hire people everywhere, from dishwashers to people with graduate degrees in law and science and elsewhere. So we would be a major contributor to the island's community, a major contributor to the economy. Our people use the entertainment, the food businesses, the business support businesses in the area as well. I think that we can make that contribution if you give us the chance. Our problem is time. And we hope that you can help us with that. Thank you. If you. Still read. And then Thomas Blank. Hi. I'm Phil Red. You're a local cannabis activist and I hope everyone has a fun and safe. For 20 celebration. This Friday. I ask everyone here who voted. Ask everyone who voted against access to cannabis to please recuse themselves from this process. Their views have not really. Evolved and there is nothing preventing them from trying to prevent or exploit the success of our industry. I see what happens when Trump lets people who want to dismantle an industry are the same people put in charge to regulate it. I would sleep a lot easier if only cannabis friendly people were participating in the guidelines from this point on. And of course, I would like to shine a spotlight on the most anti cannabis members on the board Marilyn Ashcraft and Frank Maher. Easy, that is all. Thank you very much. Goodnight. Thank you, Thomas Blanc. And then Suzanne Blanc. Hello. My name is Thomas Blanc. I'm a Ph.D.. In analytical chemistry. I'm a Ph.D. and a little chemist. I work for Stepper Labs. I'm a grandfather of. Four, soon to be five. And I have two kids. And none of my kids smoke cannabis. Okay. That's their choice because they were raised to know that at a young age, it's not a good idea. It's like alcohol. It's not a good idea at a young age. And what I'd like to do is appeal to people here today. That another thing I see with young people and I worry for my kids is where are the jobs. Coming from? Where are the jobs that pay coming from in the East Bay? Where are they coming from? How are these people? How are these kids going to be able to grow up and stay here? This is a very. Dynamic and powerful industry. The labs are going to supply jobs that are getting close to six figures on average, and kids will be able to be employed in some of these areas. And if they get the right background, they're learn all kinds of skills that are. Almost forensics in nature. We deal with the safety of cannabis, heavy metals, pesticides. These are key areas which we think are absolutely necessary and it needs to go forward. We'd like to do it in Alameda. We live in Alameda since September. We love to stay here, too. We love the town. It's a very friendly for families town. And I like the quiet. The people are courteous. So I'd like to again. I'm going to back about Brian said is that we're getting pushed by the state we have to expand our capacity if we can't get this you know, expanded capacity in time for when the business flow comes in, we're going to have to rent another lab somewhere. Else. Okay. You know, this is. The way if we have capacity and business that we're getting, then we can't we can't do anything about it. We'll just have to expand and. Make another decision. This is the first choice. I love the community. Our are the jobs we're bringing are about safety. Safety of people, which in the future, heavy metals and pesticides. This is all going to impact our health care system. So I would say right now, a forward looking person would say, we've got to cut this out now. Thank you. Thank you. Suzanne Lenk and then Kathy Bean at Warner. And Emily Richardson, if you want to speak on this item, please submit your slips now. Hello. My name is Suzanne Plank. I also work at Steep Hill Labs. I'm a lab technician. I'm also a registered nurse for 30 years. I think people should take time to find out the true medical benefits of cannabis. And at Steep Hill, we spend a lot of our time testing for pesticides and other things, microbes and things that might be harmful to patients. My main concern is patients and the state deadlines and we need to move fast. And we've been living here in Alameda for us since September. It's a beautiful place, a wonderful place to live and would love for our company to be able. To move. Here if possible. Thank you. Thank you, Emily Richardson. F. F. Thank you. I'm the cleanup for a steep hill, but I'm honored to be here with a colleague, but also a competitor. And it's very rare for colleagues and competitors from different in the same industry to to be here today. And Emily's going to speak right after me. But between Emily and Steep Hill, we represent CW Labs. We represent the two oldest and most prestigious labs, probably in the United States. And we both want to come to Alameda, but we want to come to Alameda. We identified space, this 40,000 square foot space that you all know that we're looking at, Emily's identified space that's empty and available and ready to go. We have to be up and testing on July 1st to protect public safety. We are mandated by the state to do that. So if we can't move as quickly as possible to get in here, you guys have made the decision to bring in cannabis businesses, if only CW and Steep Hill end up being the two labs that apply to you. We're here to just beg you to move as fast as you can, because, again, we represent public safety. We we don't represent foot traffic. We represent good jobs. And we want to be here and the spaces available. And it's and it's been empty for. In our case, ten years. I think in Emily's case, I'll let her address it. But please consider labs a little bit separately if you possibly can. Several other communities throughout the state have done this. They've carved labs out of the traditional RFP or decision process. If there's any way you can do that, you will be helping the state of California greatly. Thank you. Thank you. Now, Emily Richardson. Good evening. I am a member or a resident of Alameda. I'm the vice president of CW Analytical. As Kathy said, we're here proudly shoulder to shoulder to really appeal for timeliness with laboratories. You know, as you've heard tonight, we're different or different from other cannabis businesses. We're not selling, we're not producing, we're not distributing or testing in our current location. We're bursting at the seams. So we want to hire more people. We need to bring in more equipment to meet the demand that the state requires. There's currently only 28 licensed laboratories in the state of California to serve the entire state. Steep Hill and CW are two of those 28. In order to really support the state and the public health and safety of consumers using these products. We need to we need to grow. We have a beautiful, beautiful space. That we literally talk and dream about every day on Bay Farm Island. And a landlord who's fully in support, who's a dentist, a longtime resident of Alameda, who wants us there, who's trying to wait for us as long as possible. As this process continues, I have no doubt in my mind that we will 100% fulfill any of the qualifications on the RFP. We're not worried about that at all. It's the timeline that's really concerning, and I'm really appealing to you to provide some sort. Of carve out, raise the cap. On labs. There is not the city is not going to be overrun with laboratories. There's only so much laboratory space you're allowing for for manufacturing facilities. I don't know why there shouldn't be a limit on labs. So, you know, it's not to get in there to reduce competition. We're all in support of that. Just please, if there's any way that we can speed along, the laboratory process. Would help. The state of California. We're in contact with the bureau every day. They're really concerned about capacity issues and we want to grow, bring on more staff, well-paying jobs, all that. So thank you so much for your time and thank you for your consideration. Thank you. So she's our last speaker. I'd like to ask staff if you could address the issue in regards to the process for labs, if you have any ideas of what we can do to try to accommodate. Hmm. Our ordinance doesn't require that we include them in the RFP process. It was just direction of council. So it gives you an alternative to say that they could just apply when our application is ready for for lab space. I do want to disclose, though, that I have had three laboratories contact me and you have slots for two. Okay. So if we wanted to increase the number of labs that. We would have to do that by ordinance. We would have to come back to you and we could do that fairly quickly within, I guess, a month and do that. We can do a first come, first serve as well. On the application. But I do know that we have three. Okay. Interested? Okay. I wanted to follow up in regards to these other questions and issues that were raised the the opening on in regards to who's participating from staff. The list of who's participating for staff is in the staff report. What we did not do is put it in the regulations. The reason we didn't put it in the regulations was because if a staff is decides to take another job, for example, we would have to come back to you and change that name. This way we would we would be able to get someone in a similar capacity to to serve on the the panel. And could you describe but from the staff report what the proposal is currently. But the plan is. Yes. So technical support to the panel. Lord Butler, myself. Real estate. Property management. That would be Nanette McConnell. By the way, if you want to follow along on people, it's pages four and five of the staff report. And finance. It would be the finance services manager, Edwin Catto, a planning person. The City Council asked for a planning person that would be Kathleen Livermore, and she she's a part timer. And then the other city department and related to cannabis is Liam Galan with Public Works. And I missed one for him is health. That would be Jackie Cross with Mastic. She's a manager in the senior center. Let me let me finish. And then I'm going to go to other councilmembers the first. Okay. So I want to just make sure that everyone that spoke on that issue understands. You can you can go to the staff report and you can see who at this point we are planning to go forward with ever, as Lois explained , that we in regards to the RFP itself, it would not have or the ordinance itself, it does not include those names so that it does allow for change. If, if, you know, if if it works out that we need to do that in regards to the prohibition, to researching during the process, you want to speak to that ? I think the thought on that was that we didn't want the panelists to be biased by doing a lot of outside research, comparing one to another. And so we limited it to no research so that people could evaluate the proposals on their merit. And now if they if questions came up during the process between the of the panelists, is there an opportunity for them to, for instance, speak to you to say, we think we need more information on some issue and get that? Is there any. And the ability to do anything like that. Is not the way it's proposed. Okay. And then is that unique to cannabis, this ordinance, or is that the way we always do if we have to do a selection? It it we we do it different ways depending on on the situation. This is pretty unique in this case. It's actually a standard. We typically don't ask for additional outside research. We want the proposals to stand on their own merits. We want the proposals to be evaluated on the basis by which they are submitted. And we don't want panelists doing additional research because part of what we want to know is that people put their best foot forward, they did a complete application or they didn't, and they're going to be evaluated on that basis. And that is the way we conduct our request for proposals for all kinds of contractual services. That's correct. Okay. And then in regards to questions that goes to the same I assume the same answer if that we do, in fact, want to keep the same questions for all applicants. Yes. We do want to keep the same questions for all applicants. And just to clarify what I was saying, we normally do research on when we put out request for proposals. So this is unique. So we research who we put it out to. Okay. And also, madam, if I might, as far as answering questions, we can ask follow on questions, but we typically like to have the standard questions. Everybody gets the same question, but as the candidate answers the questions, if we have questions, we, you know, the panelists subsequently want to ask something, follow on. He will do that as a clarification. But we like to have standard questions so it's fair for everybody. Okay. So so then I do want to clarify that because that was not my understanding from reading it. Are you allowed to do follow up questions, calling them clarifying questions or some other kind of question? Now that we've. Set up the questions for the oral interview is that they are standard questions and there may be a clarification follow up, but there's not going to be extensive follow on questions. It's really intended to clarify. That was the intent of the staff and the committee's work. Okay. Thank you. Then I want to also just express my opinion that I am I personally do not support having a cap on labs. I know that that is part of the ordinance I'm absolutely interested in at some point as soon as possible, honestly bringing it back. I do see it as a public health and safety issue as well as a job issue. And I would also appreciate if we could, working with council members, figure out a way to expedite the process for the labs. And I appreciate that we apparently have three. I think it's unfortunate that we do have a cap on that. I would hope that my colleagues would be interested in trying to figure out how to address that. And then I'm going to go to vice mayor. So a couple of follow up questions. Regarding the list of the staff participating. If the staff. There was no member of public safety listed, correct? Correct. Didn't hear one. And so if a staff member leaves, they wouldn't be replaced with somebody from public safety. Right? They would be replaced with someone in these categories. In the same categories. I just want to make that clear for the record, for anybody who had any questions out there. Our intent is not because it was there was a question about whether or not our intent was to kind of slide something in that wasn't listed in that. That is not the intent. With regards to the lab, is it? You know, if we did an RFP, is it possible to expedite it based off of what's provided without kind of rewriting everything? I mean, is there a way to kind of separate it out and do an RFP that would be on an, you know, in an expedited manner because of the time sensitivity? And I see John and. Debbie getting up went over. We were caucusing a little bit about this and we believe that there if there's an interest in expediting this, we could make a simple revision to the regulations where we talk about a master RFP process, and we could do this at a raise to carve out the lab and run a more streamlined or expedited process, if that's the desire. Or we could open it, shorten the timeframe, or we could sort of have a first come, first serve, submit your application, your operator's application. And we could evaluate the actual operator's application because this RFP is set up to award businesses with the privilege of applying for an operator's permit. So we could, for the labs, streamline that and go directly to an application for an operator's permit. Mm hmm. Is one option? Or we could do a streamlined RFP process. Okay. And my question or my concern relative to you moving to a first come first serve, is the notice involved in that? And whether or not we set ourselves up there to potential applicants here tonight, there's one that isn't, but there's one another one that you know of. Are we setting ourselves up to get sued, which would then slow down the process if we switch? Well, we're not legally obligated to use an RFP process to award a limited number of permits. It's something that I think the council felt was a fair and equitable process. But if we have the contact information for the the other lab, we can certainly outreach to them and then let them know that the process, if the process is changed this evening, we could certainly do that. We're also planning to placing an ad in the paper next week, letting folks know that the RFP is available and we can still move forward with with that kind of outreach. But we don't have a legal obligation to do this RFP process. I think it's what the Council felt was a fair and equitable way to award limited permits. A number of jurisdictions reserved their RFP process strictly for the dispensaries and didn't undertake an RFP process, even though they limited, for example, in San Leandro, they're capped at five manufacturers and they just do it first. It's kind of, you know, the process is just come in, fill out your your application and go through the process. Sometimes there's more interest in doing this process for the dispensaries. The council was interested in looking at all of the capped business categories, but I think people didn't anticipate maybe the length of time and then the July one start up and some of the other issues surrounding the labs. Okay. And I'll just add that I concur with the mayor regarding I think that there's a couple of things in the ordinance that are worth looking at later on, not not tonight, because I do not. My concern would just be delaying this overall process. So, you know, but I am interested in looking at potentially changing some of those numbers and looking at some other portions of it. I mean, just follow up. Does that mean in regards to not increasing the cap on the labs? Is that what that meant? Well, I I think my concern would be what we heard from staff is that if we increased the cap now, we would be delaying the process. That I would be interested in perhaps having that ordnance come back at a later date to increase the cap or remove it. Right. Just briefly. So just to follow up on the vice mayor's comment, so this other city department, are we keeping that other city department or are we actually going to say, for example, public works and that's where it is right now. It would stay public works. Our intent is to keep this list as it is. Okay. I mean, just to follow up on those points, I mean, the state has an interest and I think also everyone that lives here has an interest in having a safe supply of this product. So. I mean, I could go either way, depending on on where my colleagues are. But if we think we can either raise the cap or remove the cap on labs and do some type of first come, first serve, my concern was when it was just too that it'd be like the first one to the first floor permit counter and then they would be the ones that would get it when, you know , maybe we would need a little bit more evaluation. So I mean, if it's possible to do it that way or if it's possible, I don't know if it's possible for them to get permits, even if we did accelerate the make one suggestion. So of course, John. So just to clarify, sorry, I want to start from the beginning. It is true that nothing in the ordinance requires us to use an RFP. What we've done or you have before, you are implementing regulations to implement a portion of the ordinance and that portion is the cap. So you've got in the ordinance language about a cap. Now you have to decide how you want to implement that cap, who gets in and who doesn't get in. And that's what the implementing regs are for. I see two options that are possible, both of which have been already announced. One is to raise the cap. The problem that I see with raising the cap is one it causes it may cause some delay. The other one that hasn't been stated is if you go to raise the cap, can't do it tonight because it's not been noticed. You'd have to do it at another meeting, you a first in a second, and then once you do that, you could raise the cap to three. But then suddenly you have four people now and then you have the same problem. So sure, we even need a cap for the second. I think so. Then the floor. So then the second alternative excuse me is to. Take the current implementing regulations, make an amendment to it so that the language that talks about having a single master IRP for all cannabis businesses. But instead take that and carve out perhaps testing laboratories to follow a different RFP process. And the only difference is it's on a more compressed schedule. So that's a possibility that you might want to consider. And, you know, I would just suggest that we add a schedule to the RFP for the laboratories to make that more compressed. We we take some time out of that. And so we don't have to redo an RFP. Just add a special schedule for the labs. Okay, I can sit down. If I could get a minute and come back up here and tell you where we can reduce the schedule. So I'll let Debbie talk while you have other questions, and I'll look at the schedule right now and try to get a recommendation to you. Okay. Because I think the rest of my question, John or Debbie, whoever wants to answer it, you know, even under a compressed RFP, would we have time to select people that are eligible for a permit, get them to apply for a permit, and have the permit approved in time for them to meet whatever state deadline they're doing . So that's the concern that I have, because if you remember, the process under the ordinance is that there's an operator's permit as well as a land use permit. So I'm not sure that I mean, July one is not very far away. And I'm not sure that even with the compressed schedule for an RFP, you can get through the operator's permit and then the land use permit. It's a sequential process so that you may want to consider if the goal is really to meet that July deadline that you, whoever comes in with their completed operators, permit application. First we start processing. If someone comes in with a second completed application, if they come in if for any reason, we get them simultaneously. I mean, we can date, you know, we can date and time stamp. And if whoever is deemed complete first because we will, that's the first thing we'll do is to determine whether or not there's a completed application. So, I mean, Lois may take a hard look at the timeline and say, well, we can cut to three weeks, but I don't think. That plus the operator's permit, plus the land use permit and all the noticing that goes with that, you know, like a land use permit in front of a planning board that is without really looking at that deadline that just standing here, it that's going to be tight. So in your opinion, because we rely on your opinion or your recommendation, you know what, this is a priority. So for me to make sure we can have these folks that are actually ready to go up and running by July 1st. I mean, what is your suggestion as the best possible way to do that? And if you recall, back in December, staff's recommendation was that we well. That we didn't. Do so. So tell us what we need to do. I would say start feeling sorry. I thought I'm yeah, I would. Say that even on that given that where we were. Staff feels comfortable with a first come first serve with the labs on a you know demeanor the complete applications and and processing those. Okay. Thank you, Miss Potter. So I just found out, do you need a motion to do something like that or direction? What would you like that to look like? You were going to want to. I speak to mayor. Yeah. I think we are going to need an amendment to the implementing regs that are before you this evening to carve out the labs and then to to direct us to do something different. Is someone keeping track of all these amendments that you may be? That, right? Yes. Someone's doing that for us. Thank you. Member Ashcraft. Thank you. So I first want to disclose that I have actually visited Steep Hill in Berkeley and I met all the speakers and I believe I've met Emily too, somewhere along the way because you look very familiar. But I also at the time felt that we were really almost doing the reverse. We allowed two testing labs for manufacturing facilities, and yet every product has to be tested. And as we heard, there's a startling under capacity for labs. So I would want to do whatever we could to to expedite, which it sounds like. Mr. Potter, you're going to give us a suggestion for the best way to do that. I would be tempted to raise the number to at least for the same number of as we have, manufacturing facilities or lift the cap altogether. But everything is in balance or gets out of balance quickly because does that then inundate staff or is that something to be concerned with? So hold that thought or go ahead and answer it now. I've got a couple of other questions. So to lift the cap, we would have to come back to the council with an A with an ordinance amending the existing ordinance. So that is also a process that would take us beyond July 1st, most likely. So we could move forward with the two. And if there's a desire and more demand for labs, we could deal with that on a separate track. And if and if you were to move forward with the first two you have, could you still get them to be able to meet that July one state deadline? If we if we go directly to what we're talking about, a sort of a first come, first serve for your application for your operator's permit. And we just put aside the RFP process and really reserve that for the manufacturers, the nursery and the dispensaries. And then relative to staff time, if you recall, will be coming back to council with a fee study. This program is intended to be revenue neutral and we have the ability to hire additional resources to assist us with with this effort so that we could accommodate the council's desire, if there's a desire to allow more, you know , more operators. I appreciate that. And I would certainly be in favor of that because I understand the dilemma the these operators are in. They want to put money into these sites that they've found to get them ready. And yet they don't want to do that until they really know they're going to be able to move forward with the operator's license. So I think it looks like a vote is coming up. But let me just ask a couple of clarifying questions I realized I missed. And this has to do with it's exhibit one, which is your and it's the the resolution. So on page six, it says, okay, it talks about once an award letter is issued, the awardee has 60 days from the date of the awarding letter to apply for a cannabis business permit. Failure to do so may lead to disqualification from further consideration and immediate revocation of the awarded award letter. So my question is, since the language says may lead to disqualification, under what circumstances would failure to apply for the permit in 60 days not lead to disqualification? Does that make it more limited? So the intent of this requirement is that we want to compel folks who who land a slot with one of these permits that they actually open the business and don't sit on their permit. So we want there may be extenuating circumstances, like you need a time extension because your tenant improvements aren't happening as quickly. So we might not revoke it in that instance. But if there's been no progress towards getting yourself open, that might be the basis on which we would revoke. And is this where the one time you would extend this one time deadline for good? Cause that's, I think, paragraph. Four of Section G says the awardee. Miss. Well, this is Ms.. Secure all the requisite approvals to begin commencement of operations. But the city manager or designee may extend this one year time deadline for good cause. Yes. Okay. All right. So I guess I'll work on a case by case basis at. Exactly. Okay. That's fine. Okay. Well, I'm a I would like to see what we can do to get more labs and get them in under the state deadline. Does that mean that you would be interested in removing the cap or. I would actually defer a little bit to staff because there's no point trying to do something quickly if we're going to inundate staff. But I would definitely say bump it up to four and I get you bump it up to four, you get five, but, you know, four labs going. I just I try to be mindful of it's the same staff doing lots of different things. I appreciate that. Okay. Member matter. Thank you. But I think the labs are probably the lowest risk of the three segments that are listed. Probably the most important. Because it's quality control. So I think anything we can do to allow. Them to meet that deadline. Is I'm open to and I do want to make sure they're qualified. And I think we lose some of that ability by deflating the RFP process. So that's a balance that I'd like for you to. Tell us how we're going to ensure that we get a real lab there. Present company excepted, but someone who who's capable of doing this and I think it's important that we spend the precious time , we have it at council meetings to launch the program rather than to try and adjust the program, because I just don't see how it's going to happen. Of if we try and redo the ordinance and then get a lab license to have. So how are we going to make sure that we get a qualified laboratory to submit their permits? So the RFP process has to distinguish one lab from another or one business from another of the same type. And what the application process does, it further digs into the business, and it has in fact more questions and requirements. And so they have to go through our application process, which we will be providing you a final draft of soon. It's in its final stages, but that's a more rigorous process that. I am sorry to interrupt, but I understand that part. But when we have three interests, two. It would be first come, first serve. Okay. So that's the option you're talking about. Yes. Replacing. That for laboratories, making it first come, first served. And you go through. And whoever gets through the process first they get apply on the same exact date. But they may not get through. They may not get through the the process of the application process and the things that they need to do in a timely manner. Thank you. Okay, very good. So I would like a staff to look at parallel a parallel path of either increasing the number of labs or removing the cap entirely. To hear back on that issue. And then the other hand, you can implement this because I'm sure I'm going to have a motion. So I would like to make a motion to approve with an amendment where we would pull out the labs and do a first come, first serve process for those. And I agree with the mayor regarding having a parallel track to have the ordinance come back to us, because I don't want to stop the process. I'll second that. But if if it's possible to modify that because if if we do decide to move it up to four or take it away, and there is a third one that may be like minutes late or whatever, you know, would we still I think we should still should keep that in process because they may have to go through the permitting process and they may be able to be in the middle of it by the time we change. And that would still apply if it's first come, first serve. And that's the process that we have in place so long as we update the ordinance. Yeah. So we wouldn't like tell them. No, I'm sorry, you can't do anything. Okay, so I'll second that. So it's essentially a rolling application, right? Just a way to get it going. I think there's kind. Of. I don't have an idea yet of four or zero or four or no caps. Let's come back with that. And my preference is no cap on the labs. Member. Not member matter. Can I make sure the motion, if we could split that into two motions first? Yes. Do the first come, first serve and then second to the ordinance? Yes. That's not really my preference because we're still in the consent calendar. But but my actually my preference when it's 830, I'm happy to end it, you know. Okay, I'll I'll do it. But I just don't want this conversation to keep going because it seems great. Okay, fine. That's fine. I'll bifurcating. Fractions. Different question. Yes. So embarrass craft. Through the chair and vice mayor. Is it do you also include the streamlining of the the application approval that Mr. Potter was talking about? We just talked about first come first come. First that what we're voting on. Well, okay. But not to go through the whole RFP process. But two laboratories would be carved out of the. Layers of motion in a second. That's what I'm looking for. Okay. Okay. It's included, right. So everyone so we're just doing the first part, the first come, first serve now. Right. And Corbin has a crack at us the carbon. Okay although some favor I that part that motion passes unanimously and now the second part of the motion. For. To remove or to look at. To have staff come back directing staff to come back with the ordinance relative to the cap on the labs to either remove it or increase it. August 2nd in a parallel track. All those in favor. I know. Motion carries 4 to 1. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think. That want to get through that and then the next the next part of that would. Be so I'm sorry. We're not done. The next part of that would be to approve the form of the RFP with the NOW. Thank you. Second. Well, I actually need her to finish. I need you to finish your the entire motion so it's clear. Okay. It would be to carve out the laboratory from the process. Oof! That got you moved, right? Yep. Second, all of them favored by that motion carried unanimously. You guys need anything else on this issue? All right. Thank you. That item. Thank you very much. So now we are on, I think, five. I think my.

But thank you. 15, please. Report from Economic Development Recommendation to authorize city manager to sign, petition. And subsequent ballot relating to city owned properties located. Within the boundaries of the downtown Long Beach property and Business Improvement District Districts one and two. Okay, I recognize Californians and they ask for their hand up for emotion and confidence and back Allen for a second chance on whether they are actually mayor. Vice Mayor. I'm actually just I have to recuse myself because I have two properties in the people I'll be fighting off. Okay. Thank you. So we need a second on it. I'll seconded. Councilwoman Zero. Do we have a president? That's right. Staff report. Excuse me. Yes, there are staff. Is there a brief staff report? Yes. Eric Romero from Economic Development can give a brief staff report in. All right. Good evening, Mayor. Members of the city council. My name is Eric Romero, and I'm the business development officer in the Economic Development Department. I would like to start by providing you some brief background on the downtown bid renewal history. The downtown pivot was established by the City Council in 1998 for a five year term. It was renewed for the first time in 2003 for a ten year term. It was renewed for a second time in 2012 for an additional ten year term. And the downtown pivot is now up for its third ten year renewal per state law. Ten years is the maximum term for a period that already surpassed its initial five year term. The permit renewal process, which has been led by the downtown Long Beach Alliance, was informed by a strategic planning process that included interviews, roundtables and an online survey completed by more than 500 downtown stakeholders in the next ten year term. The downtown pivot revenue will support a more robust, clean and safe program programs that address and assist downtown's unhoused population. Economic development programs that support small businesses and focus on business attraction marketing at special events and beautification and place enhancement activities. If the downtown permit is renewed. The estimated total annual cost of the city for the fiscal year 2023 assessment is 787 $785,156. Of that total amount, $220,000, more or less will be paid by a private property owner that manages city property in downtown. The remaining city assessment is $564,672. The recommendation before Council today is to authorize the city manager to sign the petition and subsequent ballot for city owned properties in support of renewing the downtown pavement. That concludes my staff report. Thank you. All right. Thank you for that report, Councilwoman Dana. Thank you so much, Vice Mayor. And thank you, Eric Romero, for that very good presentation and also for all the work that you've been doing on this. I think that that. Our downtown area is a very lively and fun area for everyone in the city, but in particularly for youth. I think that for many. Many years, we've learned that he cut our key criteria to ensuring our city continues to prosper, rest in the ability to keep our young adults living and working in Long Beach, way beyond high school and college graduates, especially in the downtown area. We need them to stay more. More importantly, we'd love for them to want to stay in our downtown area. In that same sense and for many other reasons as well, is very important that we care for our downtown area, establishing this area as a property and business improvement district. Back in 1994. First helped us get to a point where we can count on having additional services in maintenance, public safety and marketing in this area. These are services that are very much needed and that help us keep a clean and attractive area for our residents, for our youth, our young adults, and even for tourists and visitors as well. However, I do have I do have a couple questions that I that I would like to answer, if possible. I know that one of the main concerns with this debate in need for residents and business owners has been the 30% plus increase. If staff can answer this, how will this increase in assessment impact on local businesses during this recovery phase? We are in. Thank you. Councilwoman, I'm happy to answer that question. I do want to acknowledge, as you mentioned, that the property assessment rates for the downtown Peabody, if renewed, are projected to increase by an average of 34.5%. And the increase is really driven by a few different factors. So through again, the outreach that was completed through the strategic planning process and the Peabody renewal process. There is there was a request for additional services which include expanded sidewalk pressure washing services, increased tree trimming and plant maintenance, the hiring of a homeless outreach manager to collaborate with social service organizations to support people experiencing homelessness. The hiring of a downtown business navigator to provide better wraparound support services for both new and existing small businesses. And also an acknowledgment that there's a need to increase pay for clean and safe team to assist with both retaining and attracting talent in a competitive labor market. So for those reasons, the property assessment rate is recommended to increase. As certainly, you know, there will be additional costs that are taken on by both property owners and business owners. But I think really here that the case in terms of the downtown pivot is to leverage collectively a lot of different resources to further invest and support the downtown, to both improve beautification and the quality of life, and have an urban and a vibrant urban downtown center, which really is the benefits of downtown pyramids and pyramids. And Peabody is generally. Great if you feel like work. Also, could you share with us so the community can know some of the outreach that has been done on this people? Absolutely. So while the strategic planning process isn't required in advance to leading up to a downtown permit renewal or a permit renewal in general, the downtown Long Beach Alliance did decide to lead a comprehensive strategic planning process that again included a variety of one on one interviews, focus groups, roundtables and an online survey to gauge input directly from property owners, from business owners and residents that are ultimately impacted and supported by the services that are funded by the downtown period. Revenue for the online survey alone that included over 500 responses from downtown stakeholders. Additionally, the strategic planning process was also implemented under the guidance of a 35 member committee that included property owners, business owners and residents, and of course also included the downtown Long Beach Alliance board of directors, which again includes property owners, business owners and members of the community. Thank you, Eric, again. I think that's very important for the community to know about that. And, you know, the outreach that has been happening, I want to say that I know that in this particular item that we have in front of us today is so that we can prove to be for the as a member of this people that we can approve to sign the petition going forward to be part of this bill. I think that's also very important, and maybe you might be able to elaborate a little bit more on that. Yes, I'd be happy to. So through the Peabody, both formation and renewal process. Property owners that are ratepayers into the Peabody are responsible for ultimately vocalizing their support or their their being against the Peabody renewal or formation. So all property owners in the petition phase, which is a phase that we're currently in for the downtown renewal all property owners of record that own property in the downtown Peabody that would be subject to a private property assessment receive a petition of those petitions. Over 50% of all the property owners responsible for assessments in the Peabody have to return that petition in support of renewing the permit in order to enter the next phase of the Peabody renewal process. The city of Long Beach is a large stakeholder and property owner in the downtown Peabody. So the recommendation today and the decision in front of you today is to really authorize the city manager to sign the petition for city owned properties in favor of renewing the downtown Peabody. Assuming that over 50% of property owners, based on the weight of the assessment, return their petitions in favor of the Peabody renewal, then that would trigger the next phase of the renewal process. Thank you. Could you also explain how what it would be like if or what would happen if it didn't meet that threshold? Yeah. That's a that's a really good. Sure. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So if if the there is a timeline to renew the P bid, currently the timeline that we're working toward is really by summer 2022, by August 2022. And so it's important right now to secure, you know, all of all enough support in the petition process to renew the bid. If that support is not secured, the bid renewal process would not continue. So again, the recommendation for you today is really to authorize the city manager to support the permit renewal through ultimately filling out the petition in support of urban renewal for city owned properties. Thank you. And lastly, I was wondering if you if you could express to to the community how much of the first District is now in this piece that the downtown Long Beach Association Alliance. Yeah, that's a good question. I don't have all of the details on all of the parcels in front of me right now. But I can say the bulk of the downtown period is in the first council district now. Yeah. Thank you. I also like to take this moment to give a shout out to the Red Shirts from the Army. There are safety ambassadors who are amazing and do a great job out in our downtown area as well as the cleaning team. I know I personally use the safety ambassadors a lot to go from point A to point B, especially at night when I'm exploring the district. So I just wanted to say thank you to all of the safety ambassadors for all the wonderful work that you do and for always helping us out as well with our people experiencing homelessness and for always being so compassionate to them as well and trying to provide and help them find services. I know that your job is huge and I just wanted to take a moment and acknowledge. Thank you very much. Right. Thank you. I'll offer my comments in my second here. So we should absolutely as a city, both support the renewal of the event. In terms of the additional cost, I think it's important and thank you, Eric, for underscoring that the goal for this enhancement is to have a sort of more capacity to deal with nuisances in the area, to help keep the area safe, help make sure that we can navigate people around that are experiencing homelessness to the right services. And I think that's incredibly important. And in our downtown that we have that local touch from our downtown Long Beach Associates. And I think it plays really well with some of our strategies. Our local sort of non non-police led crisis response is around homeless homelessness. I think in order to really make an impact, we're going to have to see the P bid step up and the city staff to see see a real difference. And so I know that that's not cheap. I know that's also what the downtown businesses are asking for, what the downtown residents are asking for. So the city needs to be publicly supportive of this, not only just in our budget, but we should you know, we should probably talk about our partnership and the things that we're going to do with this enhancement to help make sure that our our downtown is clean and safe. And so I'm happy to answer a second here. I'm going to ask if there are any other council comments so I can take a list. Okay. Hearing none was here. Public comment. Are there any members of the public that would like to speak? Please line up at the podium. Or if you're attending, virtually, please use the raise hand feature or dial star nine. This is per item 15. Your time begins now. Thank you. Good evening, Honorable Vice Mayor and members of the City Council. My name is Austin Mature and the Economic Development and policy manager for the de lba and the Delta Project plead for the renewal of the downtown property based Improvement District. First, I'd like to thank city staff and Councilwoman Mary's and de Haas and Councilwoman Cindy Allen and your assistance in helping to engage the downtown community. And I would like to also reflect, as stated by staff, that our process for renewing the property based improvement district really began back in January of 2021 with the convening of the strategic planning process with residents, property owners and small business owners. And during that process, we came out with five key themes to address within the new property based improvement district safety and security within the downtown, cleanliness within the downtown, connecting our unhoused population with available resources, addressing the storefront economy and vacancies, and assisting our small businesses and addressing connectivity issues between various neighborhoods. Since the start of the petition process, we've met with over 50, with nearly 50 property owners and one on one meetings ranging from nonprofits, large commercial property owners, small commercial property owners and residential property owners. We've engaged residents through virtual and in-person forums and will continue to engage the community through both virtual and in-person events, partnering with neighborhood associations and in ways to connect to downtown residents. Finally, I'd like to just briefly discuss, since the permit renewal only happens every ten years, I think it's important to provide historical context of where we are in the renewal process today and where we were at in 2012. Today, March 15th, we come before City Council Collection with a collection of petitions that represent 21% of assessments in 2012. The request for authorization did not occur until May 1st, and petitions represented 19% of assessments. Furthermore, we have nearly doubled our collection from residents in favor of renewal with 2 to 1 and comparison to the 2012. Renewing the debate is tough work, but we have been diligent in our process, method and outreach and I believe we are on the right track. Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this item. Good evening, mayor, vice mayor and council members. My name is Rhonda Love, and I'm a business owner operating in downtown Long Beach. First, thank you, city council for the opportunity to speak tonight on this agenda item regarding the downtown property based Improvement District. As a downtown business owner, I'd like to express my support for the renewal of the bid and the continuation of the clean and safe services that the District has provided for over the last 25 years. In addition, the Dobie's economic development programs and special events have helped tremendously and creating an active, vibrant downtown for our small business community. The special events supported by the P bid and produced by the Dolby and the community generate visitors to the downtown businesses and help us to activate our neighborhoods. Events like Shop Small Saturday, Taste of Downtown, the New Year's Eve and At the Waterfront have all helped to showcase our unique neighborhoods to residents and visitors, tourists alike . I also appreciate the P bid for its broad economic development initiatives that assist businesses in underrepresented communities. The Downtown Peace Program, the Entrepreneur Education Services and the Google Workshops in the collaboration with the community partners have had a direct and lasting impact on the small businesses in downtown. Most recently, the SBA storefront recovery grants help small businesses that were victims of recent break ins to offset their property damage cost. Since the formation of the pea bed back in 1998, the downtown has grown into a healthier, cleaner and safer community for all to live, work, thrive and visit in the area. I'd like to see those services continue with the bid and the deal. Bay. Thank you again for your time and for allow me to express my support of the bid. And I hope the City Council will help to ensure the continuation of the bid by showing your support. Thank you. Greetings. My name is and I can say sixth district resident. I actually wrote down here from my business, which is in the downtown area, just because I think it's vital to hear a, you know, perspective outside of what is the norm in the 150 block radius of the Dolby. There are only nine black businesses within them. I'm one of them. I think this is around is another one. I could list them because there's that few of them there. Actually, since the last renewal ten years ago of 2012, there's been a net decline. I think as a private entity, I can't you know, I can't tell people what to do, who to advocate for. But with respect to something like the Dolby, which is earmarked, a percentage of property taxes and stewardship of a lot of the fees that come out of the of the city, I think as a both as a taxpayer and as a business within the space, I think it's fair to express this the disappointment with respect to how I personally think things are run. I think with regards to the VA, I would not have problem necessarily with the renewal of it if I felt that African-Americans were viewed as equitable stakeholders with respect to what the future of the downtown looks like. I know on the housing and a lot of you know, our businesses sorry, on the on the housing end, we're seeing less of a focus on younger families coming in just post downtown plan. And I think with respect to the strategic plan, which I've read and I have attended a couple of the Economic Development Commission meetings, and I just keep abreast with these things. I don't necessarily know if this is an ample partner to steward some of this and this these fees. But with respect to this this moment of being able to speak, I hope that it can be used as an opportunity to kind of, you know, engage with the public and how can we bring more diverse businesses within the area? Because as it stands, the debate is not doing a great job with that, but hopefully within the future, that's something that we could see some more energy moving towards. Thank you. And just to be clear, when I say businesses, I mean storefronts, not holidays or cultural events. Those aren't businesses. Those are just moments in time, ephemeral moments sometimes. Thank you. Mayor, council members and staff. I'm Brock Howard, CEO for the downtown Long Beach Alliance. It's a pleasure to be with you in person this evening and being able to share some of our efforts thus far to renew the property based improvement district. The downtown has been described as the city's heart and economic engine, driving 1 billion in sales, in tourism, hospitality, retail and personal services, delivered in many cases by local businesses throughout the city, and resident workers as well. From most visitors, tourists, conventioneers, shoppers. The downtown will be their first impression of the city and its offerings. We have to deal. We often think of the downtown as the city's front porch. It's welcome mat to any visitor coming to our city. And over the last 25 years, the LBA has had the honor of maintaining this community in partnership with city departments and property owners, community organizations as well, while serving as a steward of the funding. The statistics are incredible. Over those ten years. In this current pivot term deal buddies clean and safe teams have annually averaged more than £75,000 of litter and green waste removal from gutters and sidewalks, 4000 instances of graffiti and stickers removed from poles and benches and electrical boxes. 8000 directions given to visitors, tourists and residents. 5000 instances of information being shared about parking, transit, hotels, events and businesses as well. That's every year on average. We've also had several partnerships with city departments that have resulted in job training programs and diversion programs for the unhoused. These are the services being delivered daily, weekly and annually to residents and commercial property owners that benefit every downtown stakeholder and in turn, give us pride in maintaining the city's front porch. We appreciate the opportunity to be with you tonight, and we look forward to hearing your support for this item. Thank you so much. Deborah, fixing your time begins now. Good evening. My name is Debra. Fix, and I am the chair elect of the downtown Long Beach Alliance Board of Directors. And I manage the property at Shoreline Village. And I want to thank the City Council for the opportunity to speak on this agenda item regarding the downtown property based Improvement District. As a representative for the property owner. I cannot stress enough the importance of the bid and the services provided by the GBA, especially over the last two years. The deal provides programs that have proven to be vital for our downtown through the pandemic. The proposed renewal plan includes an expansion of the Peabody boundary along the promenade in front of the convention center and the waterfront, enabling the safety ambassadors to engage conventioneers and visitors in the hospitality services while addressing the secure quality of life issues as they arrive at a rest downtown for the essential to its recovery and to play a central role in supporting this fall function and a growing and healthier city for all that live, work and sit. The next chapter, Gilda is being written through the hard work of its volunteer board, committee members and staff. I'd like to see those services continue with the bid and the difficulty. Thank you again for allowing me to express my support of the bid, and I hope the City Council will help ensure the continuation of the debate by showing your support tonight. Thank you. Deborah Coakley. Your time begins. Now. Good evening. My name is Deborah. I go by Deb Kelly, and I am a resident in downtown Long Beach for probably the past 11 years. I want to thank the City Council for the opportunity to speak tonight on the agenda of regarding the Peabody, which is the downtown property basically for the district. As residents, I would like to express my support for the renewal, the bid and the continuation of the clean and safe services that the district has provided for the past 25 years. The safety ambassadors, they are very helpful there and providing direction and everything for the visitors and the residences here. They're also they also offer friendly words anywhere within the district. I'm also a realtor and local realtor here. And I want to testify that every single person that I sell a home to in this area, I do convey to them about this, and they are not turned off by it. They're actually impressed by it. So this bid, from a realtor standpoint, it does add value to property here. The the value that residents have for if this goes away, it would be it would not be good. But since the formation of the people and since 98, the downtown, I've seen it grow in a healthier, cleaner and safer community for all that live here, work here, and especially visit here. I'd like to see those services to to continue on with the bid and the debate. Thank you for all of you and for letting me express my support for the bid. And I hope the City Council will help ensure the continuation of this by showing your support. Thank you. Well, the color with the last four digits, six, nine, seven three. Please unmute. Your time begins now. Yes. Right. Honorable Vice Mayor Richardson, Council members, thank you for giving me and others the opportunity to address this important item that will really shape the downtown for years to come. I'm Laura Kanab, owner. I'm the volunteer board chair of the downtown Long Beach Alliance. The debate. I'm here to speak in support of the property based improvement district bid renewal, as well as really just to show my support for staff who have been working tirelessly to deliver the great services and programs of the LBA to the community while managing the urban renewal. It's a lot of work in addition to being a volunteer. I'm also a 15 year resident. I love the downtown I'm in. The types of investments they make in the downtown are very different than other investments. We're buying homes for the first time. We're raising families. We're retiring here. We're building our lives here in the downtown and making great friends with our neighbors and business owners. I really can't imagine my neighborhood. Our neighborhood over the next ten years continue to revitalize and grow without the DDA as staff and my fellow board member detailed. Many of us are familiar with the organization through the grants and workshops provided to small businesses. The marketing support provided the special event support provided to the community, the projects to enhance and to connect our neighborhood. But as Councilman one has mentioned, most visible, you know, our clean and safe team, our red shirts, our red team, we see them around on foot, on bike, on sit on Segways. And I just really can't imagine our neighborhood without them. And let's be honest, the last two years have been very difficult. At the start of the pandemic, when the state was locked down. Who were the first people I saw on the street every day still working? They were the red team, picking up trash, fresh, washing the sidewalks, helping those experiencing homelessness to direct them to services. And honestly, just checking on our neighborhood. The new management plan provides expanded, clean and safe services and have since then include a homeless outreach wall which is very needed to be that bridge between our stakeholders and the city and our social services. The clean and safe team. They really feel a need that wouldn't otherwise be met. And the organizations at an exciting point with the search for a new leader of the organization and when selected, I'm very excited to see this new leader in partnership with others implement the new ten year plan built on the strategic planning the board and the community developed this past year. So thank you to the city for your support over the last several months. And I. That concludes public comment. All right. Let's go ahead to a roll call vote with. District one. My District three. I. District four. District five. I. District six. I. District eight. District nine. All right.

Report from Parks Rec and Marine recommendation to adopt resolution to submit a grant application to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery Tire Derived Product Grant Program for the resurfacing of Park Playgrounds at Drake, Jackson Lo Cerritos Veterans and Whaley Parks Council. Oh, I'm sorry. Councilwoman. Thank you. Mary, I just wanted to ask, are there any grants that staff has looked into that help achieve sustainability, waste reduction and climate change goals? Specifically, are we working with Cal Recycle or any other organizations in expanding recycling to our beaches and parks? So, yes, good evening, Mayor and members of the Council. There are a number of grants that we have recently and our have in the past applied for. So just this month, we submitted an application to the California Natural Resources Agency for their Urban Greening Grant program that focuses on building a healthier, sustainable California by funding projects that demonstrate. GHG emission reductions by planting. Trees and to sequester and store carbon reducing excuse me, commute vehicle miles by constructing bicycle paths and things like that. So we submitted two concept proposals, one for reforesting various parks and creating a nursery at Willow Springs Park, and then for our 14th Street Park plan, which would reclaim pedestrian right away from traffic and add trees and landscape to various park segments. We are also submitting an application to the State Coastal Conservancy for their Prop one water bond grant for the duck pond restoration at El Dorado West. And then the city has received in the past cal recycle grant funds for other departments such as Public Works Projects, Environmental Services Bureau for the Local Government Waste Tire Amnesty Grant Program. We've received used oil payment program funding and beverage container and recycling payment program. We've also received a number of grants to the California State Parks and Natural Resources Agency, including Willow Springs, Wetlands, Urban Greening Grant and the Forest Wetlands River Parkways Grant. So we are always looking and working with our sustainability folks on different opportunities. There is a citywide grant committee that meets once a month where we look at what other resources might be available to us and has a citywide process looking at what is the best proposal to put forward. So we are as we see those opportunities and are aware of those funding processes, we're in the middle of some we've received some funding in the past and will continue to look at those.

Accompanying the ordinance will be use of a master license agreement with each of the telecommunication carriers for use of city facilities in the public right away. The license agreement will include include, among other provisions, insurance, indemnity bonding, maintenance requirements and of course, annual license fees that are associated with use of city facilities. The terms of the master license agreement are intended to be consistent with the ordinance and implement those provisions in the ordinance before you this evening. You may be asking, why are we hearing this tonight? If you recall, in the summer of 2017, when Senate Bill 649 was making its way to the Governor's Desk, Council, awarded a professional services and master license agreement to five bars. Now communities and the services were for both telecommunication consulting as well as the marketing of city assets to wireless carriers in exchange for shared a shared revenue arrangement. Will SB 649 ultimately was vetoed by Governor Brown? But following that, the Federal Communications Commission issued a declaratory ruling. And I'm going to read you the title of that ruling, because I think the title in of itself is telling of its intent. And the title of the declaratory ruling was accelerating wireless broadband by removing barriers to infrastructure investment. So that was issued by the FCC in 2018. And among other things, it limited the compensation that local government was able to receive from wireless carriers for use of city facilities. So following that ruling, not unexpectedly, community communities terminated the master license agreement that we had entered into with them. So that same FCC ruling also promulgated expedited shot clock or timelines in which we have to turn around a permit review process. So the expedited shot clocks, timelines as well as excuse departure really puts us in a time sensitive nature to both adopt this ordinance and enter into master license agreements with each of the carriers as such . The second portion of this ordinance amends a different section of the municipal code to provide an exemption to the clause that requires contracts in excess of a five year term to be approved by council. And so what this ordinance amends is, it allows for an exemption for these specific types of master license agreements, since the term of those will likely be ten years since the state requires the term of the permit that authorizes the wireless facility in the right away to be those ten years. Lastly, the staff report is seeking that the council delegate authority to the city manager to actually negotiate and execute these master license agreements. So with that, I'm happy to answer any questions. I have a question. Good report, Miss Smith. Thank you. So I represent Alameda on the League of California Cities, and they were one of the very vocal bodies opposing SB 649. And I believe there might be a legal challenge making its way through the courts. Is that correct? Yes. And I'm sure our attorney's office can speak more to it. There's definitely legal challenge to the 2018 FCC ruling. Right. And so so could one of the folks from the fisheries office tell us about how how would that how would an eventual ruling form in favor of cities essentially impact the decision we're making tonight? Sure, Madam Mayor. So that legal challenge is still working its way through the court system. There is no current pending injunction against that particular federal legislation. And therefore, we have proposed to you the best and the most comprehensive local regulation that a local agencies are able to implement at this. Time. If we receive a judicial ruling that overturns the federal regulation, then we would certainly come back to you in cooperation with our public works colleagues to give you additional local control to the maximum extent possible. Thank you. Another good answer. All right. Any questions or comments? Councilmember de SAC. So I remember back in 2015, we dealt with an issue where cell towers were proposed for Lincoln Avenue and Saint Charles. I think the Pagano building or somewhere around there. Also, at the same time, cell towers were proposed for an apartment on a shoreline in grand or somewhere somewhere near there. Now, during the course of that discussion, what I recall and even from previous discussions, there was really a lot of involvement of the planning staff in terms of design, you know, esthetics, all that kind of stuff. Is it such that that that they are no longer involved in that? And so everything is now the public works department. So I'll give you the legal answer and I'll my colleagues might give you additional policy answers as well, which is that local regulation of cell towers essentially originated from two places. We have the ability to regulate the right of way and we have the ability to regulate private property. Cell towers are both. Both. In both instances, our local control is significantly circumscribed by federal legislation. What is before you tonight is the public right of way regulations. If the Council desires for the city to implement further review of its zoning regulations on private property, you can certainly give a very brief direction on that tonight for planning staff to undertake and review. But what is before you is essentially one half of the regulatory authority that the city is able to exercise. Okay. So this is just public, right? So the question that I have is I don't quite recall seeing references to the Parks Commission, Parks and Recreation Commission, and I raised that only because a lot of the cell towers are being placed in parks. I think when I look at the crazy tennis courts, you look up at the lights, there's cell towers. So is that what thought is there? And involving things like the Parks Commission or frankly speaking, even the school district? Well, I guess that would be a school district decision. Okay. That's separate the parks parks Commission. Yeah. So for that. I defer to my policy colleagues. Yes. So the ordinance tonight is is very strictly related to in the public right away, the city has more discretion when it's on private property or city owned property like parks, where we're acting as a as a private landowner. That's not covered in this ordinance, although just based on conversations with the parks that there that is still open for the possibility of placing wireless facilities less so I think cell towers. But like you had mentioned on the taller existing poles, those provide, I think, real estate for the wireless carriers to mount their antennas up there. Also by public. When I was reading this, I was interpreting public right away as public property. So what you mean by public right away is basically like infrastructure, like streets, sidewalks that are basically in the purview for the most part of the public. Yes. We're not talking city building facilities either. Oh, okay. Another area of. Discussion. I see. Okay. Thank you. Any further clarifying questions before we go to our public speaker then? Okay. We have a very patient public speaker somewhere in the audience. Come on up. Because the public is. Hello, councilmembers. My name is Chris Vegas. I'm with Verizon Wireless. It's a pleasure to be here this evening. First, I wanted to begin by thanking staff for preparing the ordinance. That's before you this evening. We appreciate the direction that the city is moving in and we're excited to work with the city and are interested in entering into a partnership with the city of Alameda that will allow. Verizon Wireless to attach. To city owned assets on the public right of way. We've reviewed the ordinance that's before you and have provided comments which highlight areas of concern for Verizon. That letter was submitted earlier today. I'm not sure if you've had the opportunity to read that, but that should have been distributed. We would like the opportunity to meet to meet with staff, to discuss the issues in further detail so that we can ensure a successful deployment for Verizon as well as the other carriers. And I would request that council direct staff to continue to work with the wireless industry as they work to finalize the design and permitting guidelines that will essentially allow for the successful deployment of small cell wireless facilities. Again, my name is Chris Vargas, and I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have. I have a question. Sure. Was there a reason you didn't submit your letter until this afternoon? A part of that is due to the fact that we were waiting on documents from city staff so that we can submit them all at once. So we received the ordinance, I believe it was last week, and then we received the additional documents this week. I believe the ordinance is actually this. The draft ordinance is attached to the staff report and we do have a 12 day advance notice. So our packets are put out to the public 12 days in advance. Right. And so we specifically wanted to provide the comments on the design guidelines as well as the permitting guidelines. And those are referenced in the ordinance, but they're not specifically called out or they're not gone into the ordinance, doesn't go into detail about what that will look like. And so that specifically what we wanted to. Comment on, because that will determine what our deployments look like. Thank you. Okay, Miss Smith, why don't you come up and. Want to clarify a couple of things? So the design guidelines and the permits permit submittal the design guidelines and permits middle guidelines actually went to our planning commission in April of 2019. Those have remained relatively unchanged, except that we will obviously need to update the reference that carriers need to consult with communities for a sublicense agreement. However, the design guidelines and the report, the permit submittal guidelines have been on the city's website since April of 2019. So I just want to clarify that we are and I have amended them to now reflect this non-equity world that we're going to be living in. And that is what Chris is mentioning before you tonight is just the ordinance. And again, what this ordinance does is vests in the public works director, the authority to update those administrative documents as needed. Okay. Thank you. Okay. That's the of our public speakers. So I'll close public comment. Counsel, your thoughts or emotion? I can go first this time. Yes, Councilman. Thank you for the report. This SB 69 was very controversial. I remember when it when it went through. Hopefully we can work with the industry. I mean, we don't have to do everything they say, but it'd be good to bring them to the table because if we can when we do part two, if everyone's on the same page, that would be helpful. So I'm willing. I don't know if I need to add that to a motion, but I'm willing to move approval of the item. Okay. We have a motion to have a second second. It's been moved and seconded. Any discussion. Yet? Councilmember So. You know, I feel that this ordinance, it proposed ordinance has has so much moving parts in, you know, the implications of which I'm just not sure. So I was just wondering if council would consider having a sunset to this ordinance after five years because I don't know. I mean, I know we need to have, you know, mortar and cell towers and all that kind of stuff, even on public rights away, perhaps. But anyways, it's just it's a thought. It's just very complicated. I'm thank you. So I will turn to the city attorney on this. I mean, this is federal law and we're just implementing our and. Is it even possible to sunset this well? So if the council so assuming it sunsetted, let's say next month and the law does not change, we would just the city would simply lose local control because there will be no further local regulation governing the deployment of these small cells on the public right of way. So it goes to the federal government to say what the. With default rules and no further local control and no further local ability to enter into licenses to authorize them or charge fees. And it doesn't sound like a good thing. Okay. It would not be our recommendation. Yeah. Okay. Any further discussion? Hearing then? We've had a motion. It's been seconded. All in favor I. Any oppose, any abstained. The motion passes unanimously. Thank you. Okay. So then we move on to. Boy, this is so written on City Manager Communications.","Introduction of Ordinance Amending the Alameda Municipal Code by: (1) Adding New Section 23-9 (Personal Wireless Service Facilities in the Public Right-Of-Way); and (2) Amending Section 2-59.3 (Limitation and Power to Make Contracts) to Exempt Master License Agreements for Use of Public Assets for Personal Wireless Service Facility Installation; and Recommendation to Authorize the City Manager, or Designee, to Negotiate and Execute Master License Agreements for Use of Public Assets Consistent with Local Law.

Declaring that the investigation, arrest and prosecution of anyone engaging in fusion related activities should be among the city of Seattle lowest law enforcement priorities and stating the council's support for full decriminalization of these activities. Thank you so much. I moved to adopt resolution 32021. Is there a second? Second he shoots been moved and seconded to adopt the resolution. Councilmember Lewis, you are the sponsor of this resolution, so I'm going to hand it over to you to address it. I do understand that you have a substitute version of of this amendment. So if you'd like to move the substitute version so that we're having a conversation about the substitutes, that would be the first step that you would need to do is make that motion. Thank you, Madam President. I move to amend resolution 32021 by substituting version two, a four version 1/2. In moved and seconded to substitute the resolution as reflected in version two, a hand back over to Councilmember Lewis to walk us through the substitute. Thank you, Madam President. The substitute. I just just flagged everybody. There's not really any substantive changes. It just reflects feedback in terms of some of the wording around the Office of Intergovernmental Relations interaction with this policy, based on feedback from the department at the time of initial introduction, it did not reflect the nuance of how OCR would prefer their advocacy at the state level to be framed. Specifically, the original resolution instructed them to, you know, to write legislation. We have other partners who will write the legislation. We will more be in a position of supporting it. That level of detail mattered a great deal to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations, rightly so. So that is the only significant change. Otherwise, it generally reflects the substance of version one. And Madam President, I don't know if you are we going to vote on the adoption now and then I'll I'll speak to the resolution more broadly after that. Yeah. So we'll we'll vote on the on the substitute version first and then I'll hand it back over to you to make comments about the, the, the resolution generally. Are there any additional comments on the substitute version? I just want to say thanks, Counselor Lewis, for being responsive to our request to talk to the Office of Intergovernmental Relations to make sure that their concerns were addressed. Really appreciate your quick work on that and your willingness to engage with them. So thanks for that. I don't see any other hands raised about the substitute. So will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of the substitute? HERBOLD Yes. Suarez I. Lewis Yes. Morales Yes. Macheda. I. Peterson I so want. Yes. Strauss. Yes. President Gonzalez. I nine in favor none opposed the motion carries and the substitute is now adopted. I'll hand it back over to Councilmember Lewis to address the amended resolution. Thank you, Madam President. I appreciate the opportunity to take this first legislative step as a body in what has been a fairly long process of engagement on this. Certainly something we can't be accused of rushing, much to the consternation of some of our stakeholders on this. But I do think that the result has been a really good, deep dove into the nuances of the policy around these substances and the current policy of our local prosecuting attorneys, as well as the Seattle Police Department. I want to thank Councilmember Herbold for her leadership as chair of the underlying committee throughout this process, which began in earnest in the spring with our discussions with folks over at Deep Nature Seattle, and then became more formalized with a letter written by this Council in June to urge the Overdose and Recovery Innovation Task Force to study this issue throughout the summer and then promulgate back to US recommendations. We did receive those recommendations in August, as the Council may recall, to adopt a resolution or an ordinance or some other representation of city policy to emphasize to the extent of our power as a municipality that law enforcement around antigens is the lowest priority for the use of municipal officials to to enforce the law in regards to those substances. And this resolution before us today is a way for us to go on the record in support of these policy goals before our budget process really gets rolling and before the state legislature convenes in January to holistically consider drug policy as the ongoing conversation post the Supreme Court's decision. The policy in front of us is limited to natural substances. Most famously, throughout this process, psilocybin and ayahuasca have been the most cited of these natural psychedelics. It is not inclusive of synthetic psychedelics that are manufactured. An example of that would be LSD. This has been a really interesting process to really learn more about these substances and things that I did not know until meeting with Discriminator Seattle and really to keep diving into this. Obviously, this is part of a broader policy conversation nationally and following on the heels of similar resolutions that have been passed in cities like Denver, Colorado , Washington, D.C., Oakland, California, among other jurisdictions. And then, of course, wholesale state law changes in Oregon just to the south of here that passed with a convincing margin in recent elections. I you know. I just want to note a little bit for the viewing public, just some of the things that have really driven me to to take a keen interest in this and how I think this resolution really sets the stage as the first significant action in the state of Washington to move this policy forward, affirmed by any government, local or state or county. And that's to to really state that these non-addictive natural substances have real potential in clinical and therapeutic settings to make a really significant difference in people's lives. And this is really the thing that personally, through the process motivated me was meeting with constituents and people who have had experiences with these substances that have really materially helped them overcome addiction and helped them overcome severe depression or other behavioral mental health conditions that have really made a difference in their lives to the point where they don't know, don't know where they would have been without the access to treatments or therapies connected to some of these substances. I. Given that Seattle is also host to one of the world's premier medical research universities at the University of Washington. And given the strong support throughout this process from many of the clinical faculty at the University of Washington in psychiatry and behavioral, mental health and medical research, it has just made it really evident that Seattle really could be a place where in the long term, we really are. For innovation around what possibility these substances could produce in terms of our ongoing struggle as a civilization of people against a lot of these really debilitating conditions. I do want to briefly address at the end of my remarks here and we heard a little bit in the public comment of the discussion around peyote. And I do want to want to just address it briefly that this resolution is not as currently worded, inclusive of peyote. Our local chapter of decriminalize nature did not want to include it because there is, as we heard, disagreement over the inclusion of the substance. And, you know, I want to thank the national chapter of Decriminalize Nature for their letter that was distributed to this council last week advocating for the inclusion of peyote. And there's no doubt or disagreement that priorities of sacred resource to the indigenous people of the southwestern United States who lived in good relation with peyote 2000 years. But because there is disagreement among the best method to reverse the century long decline in peyote and the the appropriate use of it, and whether increased access or isolation is the best approach for now. In this resolution, myself and the stakeholders at Durham Nature, our local chapter of Bikram Nature, have decided to keep peyote out of it . However, for forthcoming any potential forthcoming council actions, for example, if some of this were at some point manifested into a formal ordinance for a policy with more permanency, I think it's certainly a conversation I'm willing to continue to have as someone leading on these issues of the Council, because it does have to be crafted with very careful consideration for its impact and the need to be sensitive on the decisions around the policy related to purity. So I did just want to make those comments that we you know, we're certainly sensitive and look forward to continuing to to look into it. But this current resolution does not does not touch on it. So with that, I don't have any additional comments, Madam President, and certainly I'm excited to get this over the line and do it before we budget takes up more of my life. So thank you. Thank you so much. Appreciate those remarks. Are there any additional comments on the resolution? Councilmember. So one piece. Thank you. I am, of course, voting yes on this resolution. My office has been from the from the very first moment we heard from the activists and decriminalize nature. And many of the clinical and medical experts actually saw some of the most prominent ones who actually, incidentally, reside in District three. Since that very moment, my office has been in strong support of decriminalizing psychedelics. Some the research seems just absolutely overwhelming, as the public comment today has justified, too. And I also appreciate specifically the individuals who testified from personal experience. I really appreciate that. However, as I mentioned in council briefing last week, I am a little confused by this resolution because it is a resolution and not an ordinance and why this resolution is being passed. When there is an ordinance from my office and it has been available for months. The resolution asks the police to, quote unquote, codify policies to effectively decriminalize psychedelic drugs. But we know resolutions can only make requests. Of course, my office strongly supports resolution. In fact, we have advocated for and won resolutions in the past, but we have not pushed for resolutions in place of ordinances when it is possible and realistic and necessary from a political and moral standpoint for the Council to have an ordinance passed to decriminalize psychedelics. In fact, in fact, rather than just in rhetoric, would require an ordinance. And it is the city council, not the police department, that has the authority to pass such an ordinance. Council members will remember that on June 29th, three months ago, my office sent for introduction of Council Bill. That would have done just that. And just in response to some of the public comment today on an issue that has not been resolved. I if you are listening, I really welcome activists from the whole spectrum of viewpoints on the question of peyote to discuss with my office so that we can understand if there are any amendments to be made to the ordinance that we have put forward. And I would really like to learn more about that issue, and I certainly appreciate those who spoke in public comment about it. The bill from my office was transmitted to Councilmember Herbold, who is the chair of the Public Safety Committee. Unfortunately, the bill has languished on the chair's desk for the last three months, and the council has not. I mean, today in the Commons so far that ordinance has not even been acknowledged, its existence has not been acknowledged. And I think that the only things I've heard from council members as well, you know, some things were not resolved. Well, let's resolve those things. Why would we do a resolution? Let's do an ordinance. And I just don't I fail to see what the plausible reasons are for councilmembers who claim to support this issue. You led an ordinance which takes concrete action, sit in the cities, computers on interviews, and instead push a resolution which only has the power to make a request. And as I said, I be voting yes on this resolution. And I'm really grateful to all the activists are really urge you all to keep mobilizing and organizing for this. But please understand that we will need an ordinance to be passed by this Council for for real action, to be taken for actual changes to be seen in the city of Seattle on the issue of psychedelics and decriminalizing psychedelics. And I would urge all councilmembers who say they support the issue to co-sponsor the ordinance with me. And let's discuss if there are any amendments that needed to be made based on local and national activists input on various issues like. Thank you so much, Bobo, please. Thank you. So I appreciate the councilmember silent has introduced or I don't actually think it's been referred to my committee, and I think we held it and did not refer it yet. So I don't think it's true that it's been languishing on my desk. But nevertheless, after some discussion about whether or not the bill should be referred to my committee, we agreed as a council that we were going to hold taking any action until we received recommendations from the Overdose Emergency Innovative Recovery Task Force. Partially, this is because we're aware that there are going to be efforts in the wake of the decision and in the wake of legislation that was passed last session to respond to the Blake decision, there's going to be, I think, a really robust discussion at the state level about enforcement of not just Athena Jones, but enforcement around possession of of other drugs that are that are possessed for for personal use. So I think we're trying to be really sensitive to those discussions that are about to occur on a statewide level. And that's why we asked the task force to give us recommendations, because, again, this task force is not going to be just working on the issue around psychedelics. They're going to be working on this broader issue of of enforcement of drug laws that are that are impacting communities with disparate impacts across across the spectrum of drug law enforcement and have, you know, for for decades, for generations. And so the recommendation that we received from Task Force was specifically that municipalities in the state of Washington and elsewhere that have independent ordinance criminalizing psychedelics repeal them and those that don't should direct their law enforcement agencies, local prosecutors and municipal courts to prioritize enforcement and should publicly communicate this as municipal policy. When I reached out to the police department to make a determination of whether or not we needed to communicate this lowest law enforcement priority to the police department. Based on my understanding of the police department's communication due out, the department is not only is it not the lowest law enforcement policy, but that officers have been instructed to no longer detain nor arrest individuals under our CW 6950 413 alone, and officers will no longer confiscate drugs from an individual based only on a violation of our CW. 69504013. Now we know that policy might change. This is the existing policy of the Seattle Police Department. We as a city council are expressing our support for this continued policy, and I recognize that at a later date, depending on what happens at the state legislature, what happens with under the leadership of of a new mayor or a new police chief or a new city attorney, that we may need to look at a different legislative action than what we're taking today. But I'm very appreciative of Councilmember Lewis and bringing this resolution forward. You can't remember horrible things first a lot. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, just for the record, I'm I'm just quite surprised by kind of the more horrible response on the question of the process or the ordinance from my office. The bill has indeed been on our Consumer Herbals desk as chair of the Public Safety Committee for three months until timber might remember and other councilmembers might remember the discussion we had going down to a briefing three months ago. And I pointed out that that rodent on my office had called her office 23 times about it, asking their office to collect the one button story, which is the city's legislation management software to allow the bill to be introduced, the ordinance to be introduced, though none of those calls were returned and all of this discussion happened in public. But it seems from what Councilmember Horrible said at the beginning of our honor just now, it was implied that there was somehow an agreement among the council that the bill should not be introduced. But that's not true. There was no vote. I have not certainly not agreed. I want the bill to be introduced, debated, discussed and voted on as soon as possible. I'm not complaining about all of this in in in any at any great length, because I was hoping that council would bring an ordinance if they because, you know , I've seen this many times when my office brings an ordinance and the Democrats will bring their own ordinance, fine. You know, for us, the issue is more important, not whose name is in the city's registration legislation management software. But but it is a tangible failure at this point to bring forward an ordinance regardless of whose name is on it. And that is why we need to raise this issue, because that that is not how it happened. What happened was that we, my staff and I followed up assiduously wanting the ordinance to move forward. But, you know, it's often these kinds of sort of bureaucratic channels are used to block it. And that's why that's that's your that's your decision. But let's be open about it. Thank you. And I hope that there is an ordinance moving forward. And I again, I restate my invitation to council members to add their name to the ordinance. And let's discuss whatever remaining outstanding issues that are and let's pass the ordinance. Thank you. Thank you. Customer Support. Your objection is noted. For the record, I would like for us to refocus our comments and debate on the resolution that is before us, as opposed to a ordinance that is not before us at the time. So if we could recommit to just focusing our comments in on the amended resolution that is before us, I appreciate it. Again, I appreciate that Councilmember Salant has expressed concerns about about a resolution passed over an ordinance. It is noted. Let's let's go ahead and and finish up our our debate on the resolution. I am going to give Councilmember Lewis the last word before he has the last word. I see that Councilmember Mosquito has your hand raised. So I would like to close out debate after Councilman Mosquito's remarks. Thank you, council president. Your comments and direction is exactly the type of comments I was hoping to make today. I did want to center our conversation back on the recommendations that come directly from community or from the task force that has been working with folks who have been researching these issues, who have been exploring the possibility of the benefits of these substances, and wanting to make sure that we have an understanding of why. To me, this really comes down to a public health approach to helping those who may see some benefits of having some of these substances be available to them to treat things that are so near and dear to my heart. As many folks know, my sister suffers with multiple sclerosis. And in terms of trying to find opportunities to address the inflammation and the trauma that her brain and her body go through, I'm excited for any opportunity that allows for her to have a healthy and safe life and to experience joy and and not only for her mind , but for her body as well. I see that there's a lot of possibilities from the conversations that we've had with folks about those who have experienced traumatic brain injury injuries and folks who are dealing with immuno compromised systems, folks who have been suffering from PTSD, people who also have depression and anxiety, any opportunity that we can, especially in the wake of COVID, to help find solutions for folks in a safe way, in a way that helps people access safe substances, is something that I'm going to support from a public health perspective and appreciate the incredible amount of research that has gone into this from those who have been supporting this type of research and advocacy for years. And again, just one additional way for us to relieve stress and anxiety. And the physical and emotional symptoms of some of these complications within our mind and body. I'm going to be supporting this resolution and look forward to future work with all of you to see how we can advance these commitments today. So thanks again to the community for making this possible and centering us back on those who are potentially going to benefit from access access through this public health name. Makes me excited about the opportunities in the future. Councilmember Mosqueda. Councilmember Lewis, any closing remarks? Thank you. Madam President, I actually don't have anything else to add. I think council member Muscat and his comments are a great thing to go out on here, so I'll just leave it at that. I appreciate that. Okay, folks, will the clerk please call the role on the adoption of the amended resolution? HERBOLD Yes. Suarez Yes. Lewis. Yes. Morales. Yes. Mesquita. I. Peterson. I. So what? Yes. Strauss. Yes.

Good evening, Mayor and Council Amy Wooldridge, Recreation and Parks Director. So I'm here to discuss the Park and Recreation Facility Project Priorities. We're pulling up a map that shows you a high level look at all of the current and future projects. It was an exhibit to the staff report. So what I'll be doing with you, I know it's late, but I'm going to be reviewing the project status, the staffing and timelines and funding for each of the projects that are currently happening, as well as potential future projects, as well as essentially a third category of projects that are being built by developers but in collaboration with my department and will be managed operated by maintained by LAPD. So could I actually not have this one up with the map? Exhibit two, please. I thought this was exhibit two. I'm so sorry. Unless I got it. But if I can get the map. Okay. Thank you. The map is actually exhibit one, I think. Oh, my apologies. So. Okay, it's great. Okay, we'll fix it. So just to give you a sense of the scope, I wanted to give a sense of what I call the life of a project. This was really helpful for the commissioners when I presented at the Recreation and Parks Commission, just to give a sense of how much work actually goes into building a park. It doesn't just appear and there's a lot of steps in between when it's thought about and when it actually opens to the public. It's not just the ribbon cutting. It's not just a ribbon cutting, a fabulous ribbon cutting party, which we hold great parties. There's essentially three phases of the thank you of the park development. There's a master plan, conceptual design for starters. The second is doing detailed design and construction documents, and the third is actual construction. A fourth essentially is ongoing long term maintenance. So I always like to not lose sight of that and the costs associated with that. So for the first half, what we do is we do conduct a request for proposals for a master plan and then manage all of the public input and outreach to the community and getting that information and compiling it into a master plan and work with architects to complete that and get it back to the Recreation and Parks Commission and City Council for approval. Once we have our master plan, then we do another request for proposals for an architect to do detailed design and construction documents and work closely. That's a pretty in-depth process. During that time, we're identifying funding sources for each of these three phases. That could be grant funds, that could be development impact funds, that could be general fund, could be a mixture, usually a mix of all of them, and managing those grants in the budgets for each of those steps, as well as identifying maintenance funding. There's also securing as an island. We have a lot of permits that can take six months to a year. And so that's regional state, federal, city permits. And then we get to go out to bid for construction and do all the problem solving throughout construction. And then we get to accept the project and have a grand opening and ongoing maintenance. So staffing for these projects of what I just outlined. So as the director, I'm responsible for the overall project maintenance, project management, as well as securing all funding, managing all of the budgets, doing the master, planning the request for proposal processes, the detailed design and high level construction oversight and decisions. And a lot and a lot and a lot of problem solving. I work with our parks manager who helps consult on designs leading up to detailed designs because he knows what it works for maintenance and operations. He also assist with daily field coordination during construction. And then we have a public works project manager who basically jumps into the process once we're doing going out to bid and then coordinates the many moving parts during construction. He also will get involved in larger projects like Estero Park or Sweeney Park during design development. So we make sure it's a it's a good biddable design. As I mentioned, most of our projects are funded by a wide range of funding sources. The timing of when those sources become available is very unpredictable, will apply for grants. We may or may not get them. Development impact fees come only when housing developments are actually pulling building permits, and so that can be unpredictable. So with that, I want to start with going through the current park, our park projects to give you a sense of what we're currently working on and what's coming down the pipeline. So you know what you have before you cruisy park for starters, I want to see this. So Cruzi Park is right here on the east end of the island. We're right in the middle of construction right now as we speak. We've. Or the foundation. So it is finally actually happening. This has been a long time coming. This project replacing. Started. A. Few false starts since 2000. I think a lot about these. So we are replacing that recreation center with a new 2000 square foot recreation center. It will provide youth afterschool programs, rental facilities and much more. It will be fully built out, including furnished by June 2020. We also have the City Aquatic Center that is in concept design. It's progressing to the Commission Recreation and Parks Commission this month and to City Council in either April or May. And we had and that was a big public input process. We had three community meetings and so we're working through that. That's an interesting project because it's completely unfunded for detailed design and construction. And as you know, we're considering funding options such as a potential revenue measure. And so that's one of those projects where all these projects we can develop a park priority list, but we really need to consider it to be dynamic. And I'll talk about that a little bit later. And the City Aquatic Center is a great example of that, because if it does get funded, it would be a massive amount of staff, time and resources. If it doesn't get funded, we can redirect those staff time and resources to other projects. Jackson Park Player is something that you funded. Thank you. In the this two year budget cycle, we're finalizing several concepts for that play area currently and be bring it out to to the commission for design for decisions and then construction. And we've also been completing related pretty large maintenance projects on pathways and trees that have been taking a lot of interaction with with the local neighbors on those. We also have our annual playground replacement. We're replacing Bayport Park later this month on March 25th. We have a neighborhood meeting with designs. We'll be making decisions and that's on that and that's moving forward with Cruisy. Park is our next playground for this in 2021. We also have creek, a park parking lot actually went out to bid today for the for the parking lot itself and working closely with Greenway Golf on utilities. And that's had a lot of complications within that project. And they're also improving the sidewalks. We also have Northwest Territories regional shoreline up at Alameda Point. We recently had a thank you in memorandum of understanding, really kind of a historical moment with the Park District to to start to really move that park forward. I'm excited to report that today. Actually, I had a meeting with the Park District and we're already coordinating on how to get tours out there for the public. So it's exciting. It's moving forward. The work behind it means we need to do the lease agreement over the next year and then subsequently start working on the conceptual plan and community input with public feedback. After that estuary park we've completed a couple of years ago, phase one of the athletic facilities is heavily used and appreciated by the community. Phase two is a really critical component because that's all of the park. That's your average park that you think of for the community. It's it's it's the playgrounds and the grass area and the picnic areas and basketball courts, dog park. And that will serve that little four acre park will serve all of Alameda Landing, which currently has no park other than just some grass. It'll serve all of our Admirals Cove. So it's a bit of a a park poor area in terms of of that type of active park. It's there's no funding currently for it. It's estimated about $5 million. And so that for staff has been a top priority on figuring out how to get that funded because that's a need with residents now living in those new developments. Gene 20 Open Space Park. We've completed phase one, the most eastern portion, as well as across the Alameda Trail. Phases two and three are remaining and many people are asking when that that will be completed. It includes community garden and includes a large open space that is on hold. No working can both no work. And I can't go after grant funding until we settle the eminent domain case. And so that is essentially on hold until we we we work through that. And interject a quick question here for the city attorney. Why is it that I think I read in the staff report we don't even have a court date until February of 2021. I so in these these closed cases, unfortunately, suffer from everything else in the court system, which is that everything takes just okay. Is it just a lower priority or everything is. A lower priority to criminal cases, basically, and because criminal cases under state law has to be brought to trial within 30 days or 45 days without a time waiver. Everything is a lower priority to criminal cases. Is in eminent domain case is going to be heard before a criminal judge. No, but but in terms of how the court system distributes, judges have to staff criminal courts first before they staff civil courts. Okay. Okay. Thank you for that. And then we have the pathway is long for inside. And I'm sure I'm currently work with the city attorney's office. We've been meeting with every single neighbor, adjacent neighbor, because we have to do the legal work to get the new easements and do boundary work, survey work and get the new easements in place and get them done right so we can move past and not have the murkiness that we've had in the past. We also need to start short term improvements to make sure that the existing conditions are are appropriate and safe. And so subsequent to that, there will be design which will be quite complex. It's a four, four, five little pathways, it's a very complex design as well as a lot of regional permits. But we will start that design once we complete the legal easement work. So those, as indicated by the little blue shovel on the map in front of you are all of the existing current park projects. Okay. I'm going to jump to the projects that are being constructed, developed by developers and will be maintained by LAPD, because there's there's just there's less to say about those in some respects. But I don't want to undersell them because they are adding significant amount of new parkland to our community and will cost to maintain they'll be maintained by community facility districts so they won't be, in effect, impact to the general fund. But they also have been taking staff time on my part in terms of working with them to get the designs right for the community as well as something that we feel is appropriate to for us to maintain. So that includes Alameda Point, Waterfront Park and along Seaplane Lagoon. Those are in the green shovels and the neighborhood park, which is a small linear park, but has a lot of components packed into a little park because it's serving 800 homes. And so that has everything from fitness equipment to playgrounds to picnic areas and basketball court. So it has a lot packed into a little park. The last park being constructed by developers and maintained by LAPD is Alameda Landing Waterfront Park, which will be really unique for us. So we've been working out a lot of details on that because it's a we call it internally Pier Park because it's all a park on a concrete pier. And so that's very new for us and how to figure out how to do everything from like how do you install Drip when you're on top of a concrete pier , drip, irrigation, things like that. And so that was just more complex on the on the design front. So jumping to new park projects, those are the ones with the little trees. One is to water park, kayak launch. It's a it's a non-motorized it's a proposed non-motorized watercraft launch. So stand up paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, things like that. This was part of the Recreation and Park Commission's recommendation. They wanted to see us complete existing projects. They see the ferns on New Shore Pathways as an existing project, and they felt that this kayak launch as part of that project, simply because it was discussed, it wasn't part of the council final action, but it was discussed during that time, during that project as an alternative because that community, that neighborhood wanted a kayak launch. And and my recommendation was not to put one in in a neighborhood like that at Liberty and E Shore and instead to put it here at two Water Park. If you'll excuse the interruption. It is 1055 and council. We need to consider a motion before we get to 11 p.m.. We have two remaining items there. Council referrals items nine, eight and nine B. We have no speakers on either. Do we want to go past? Do we want to hear those after 11:00 and I need four votes. Vote some to do that I'll second. Okay, we have a motion. We have a second. Can we put a tie? I'm hoping that we can get out of here by time by midnight, and if we not move them to the next. So I'm happy to support. I wonder if we could say 1130 instead of midnight, try to get us out of here on the same day we can move discussion right here. Yeah. 11 Okay. 1130 But that will reconsider then. Yeah. Okay. All right. We're going to go until 1130 right now with the intent of hearing 99 be okay. All in favor of doing that. I can I get a verbal from you Mr.. Today so thank you. Just follow this. Okay. We're going to move quickly. Thank you. And this. Is great. So this kayak launch does have potential for funding, is completely unfunded, does have potential funding from the Division of Boating and Waterways. They have a fund specifically for public kayak launches that hardly anyone ever applies to and as a fund sitting there that they've asked me to apply for. So that has a potential D paved park is another one that is a new park that doesn't currently have any funding and is on the most western side leg of Seaplane Lagoon. It's been described in the Alameda Point town of waterfront for a precise plan is to convert its about 22 acres of existing concrete surface to passive parkland and sustainable ecological area, including wetlands. This would be designed to date over time and adapt to sea level rise. It does have strong potential for carbon sequestration benefits, but it's not specifically listed in the Climate Action Resiliency Plan for that purpose. This was recommended by the Commission to be the essentially the first new park on the list. So in terms of these four new parks that I'm discussing, they wanted to water park, kayak, launch to be first and then DEP have to be next after that. There is a strong potential funding source for this in Measure AA, which is the San Francisco Regional Bay Restoration Authority, and they have grant applications every December. So we could go to apply for a grant this December for a master plan process and then subsequently after that apply for construction. It would be a strong candidate for that. And that measure is funding, I believe, for about the next 20 years. So we have a number of cycles that we can use to go after potential funding for that. For this project. Enterprise Park is a triangular down by the internal boat launch. It's about 12 acre park between until sailboat launch and the USS Hornet, kind of includes the old Navy campground and recreation center. This has strong potential for public private partnerships. We have had a couple different local Alameda businesses express interest in public private partnerships here. The commission has has discussed this project in the past and so this is another potential project. Lastly, the Alameda Point Regional Sports Complex, a large 57 acre area up by the Alameda Point Gym in the skate park and spanning west and would have a variety of athletic facilities there. Currently, site developer Alameda Point Partners has to put had to put one point per their developers agreement $1.8 million in. So we will have that available any time we want to start the master plan process for that. Other than that, there's no design or construction funding identified. So with that I conclude my report and open any questions. Thank you. Do we have any clarifying questions of the staff report before we go to public speakers? Okay. And we have public speakers, correct? We have four public speakers. Okay. And public speakers. You all have up to 3 minutes. You don't have to feel. You have to use them all. But you've waited a long time to speak. So let's hear our public speakers Don Lemon. Ruth, Abby, Richard Bangert and Marjorie Powell. Good evening. Good evening. I did vote, but, you know, I think there's a limit on the number of hours that the weekend holds. Okay. Well, thank you. I think you're good word for that. My name is Dawn Lemoine. I'm here to speak in favor of making D Paved Park the highest priority of the Alameda Recreation Park Department. The city's recent Climate Action and Resiliency Plan focuses on, quote, an integrated approach consisting of both adaptation and greenhouse gas reduction. Development of Deep Park will further the goals of the Climate Action Plan. It will do so by number one, reducing the effects of sea level rise with the development of tidal marsh. And number two, reducing greenhouse gas as marshes act as carbon sinks through absorption of CO2 during photosynthesis. Furthermore, as we develop Alameda Point, the deep park will ensure resources remain for our beloved species of birds that nest around the Deep Park area. And I'm talking about great blue herons are endangered, leased terns, Caspian Terns, Ospreys and others. So I urge the City Council to move expeditiously to hire an engineering consultant to develop the master plan for Deep Pave Park. I further urge you to grant the HPD request for funding for an additional staff person who can start writing grant requests for the development of the park. Thank you. Thank you. Next to her. Ruth. Abby. You mean Ruth? Abby with Community Action for. Sustainable Alameda, I am also. Writing to support the. Implementation of D Pave Park. It's a unique opportunity for the city in that it is a passive park. So it's not, you know, technically about trails and and playgrounds. It's about an investment in our future. It is going to be a symbol for us, but it also is going to help us with our sea level rise, our adaptation. And I'm not and I think we feel some urgency because we may not always have the philosophy that that Parkland needs to be brought back to the wetlands and back to the sea. And so we would really like to bake this project. In to the goal setting of this council and ask that you prioritize. This project. We very much recognize the constraints that the Rec and Park Department is under in terms of their staffing, particularly for project management and support of the director. We have so many park projects and they're so important and there's so much funding out there that's available and it's the stuff capacity issue and you know that I feel like we're up against and I feel as though we would very much support the idea of additional staff support for that department. I also think this particular project of Deep Park might be something that could be supported by the new position and climate and resiliency manager to support looking for those regional grants and support the project management of a park like this. Which is not a traditional recreation. Park, but is a different kind of. Unique opportunity for us. Thank you. Next speaker. Mr. Boehner. Thank you, Mayor. Excuse me. Members of the council and staff, thank you for going through this process and putting together this priority list. And I would just echo what the previous two speakers stated very well about the importance of the park, and I would hope that you would incorporate those recommendations into any motions that you make tonight because the agenda item says approve a priority list. But of course, approving a list isn't an action item. I mean, it's a list. So I would I, I was hoping after we started this process, after the council referral back in October, that if the park came out on top, that we would then decide to move forward. And I think I think based on what the previous two speakers said, I won't say everything again, but I think we can we can start moving forward with with the planning process. And I think that's. Urgent. And I think we should begin tonight by making a motion to do so. Thank you. Thank you. Marjorie Powell. Yes. Hello, Mr.. Powell. Hello, members of the council. I am Marjorie Powell. I want to echo earlier comments and just make a couple of additional points. As Alameda Point gets developed, we will see much increased human use over what's been happening out there for the last five or ten years. That's going to put additional pressures on the various resources that are available for the all of the wildlife out there. But I'm focusing particularly on the wildlife, the birds that use that area. There is both the concern for sea level rise, but also a concern for warming of the ocean and acidification of the ocean, both of which are caused by increased human use, both of which influence the things that grow in the ocean on which the birds and the other animals out there feed. Think both the insects and the small fish. The in particular the least terns need small fish because they're feeding tiny chicks who don't chew. They simply swallow whole. So the the marshland development is going to be additionally important as that part of the island gets development. So I urge that you not only approve the list, but to the extent that staff has any resources, they start the process of looking for a consultant. And then I echo the point that when you come to talk about additional staffing, that the Recreation and Parks Department needs additional resources given all of the parks within the city. Thank you. Thank you. Is that our last proposal? Okay. So, discussion council. I mean, I look to my left. Vice mayor. I'm sure. Thank you for this. I really appreciated the staff report. I think it involved the written report provided a lot of important information. I guess I have a question. So so when I read the staff report, what I read is we have a lot of priorities. We don't have the staffing tonight. We are not being asked to add staff in. And I would not support the idea of using the currently the recent just a point just created sustainable and resiliency position to all of a sudden become kind of an A in adjunct parks position. I know that's something that might come forward in the mid-cycle, but I don't think that that's the type of working together and making sure that all of our departments are working on issues. A concept at least I approved that that piece for I. So again, I said when this came back the first time I was on the planning board, when this was when this was developed and designed, I was a strong voice for Dave Park. I'm excited about Dave Park. I'm a little concerned that it's a park that is not in any plans right now. We talk about resiliency and yet we have 11 resiliency projects that are unfunded in our recently adopted carp. This was not one of them. We have got sequestration projects in the carp that are identified and unfunded, and this is not one of them. And I'm just a little concerned that we are that that if we're not careful, I don't I'm not here to say let's not move forward with this at all. But I think if we're not careful, we're all of a sudden taking one park and jumping it to the head of a line of a lot of stuff after we've done a whole holistic planning around around parks and around and around climate. And so I think for me, if I was going to support something moving forward tonight, I think it basically I did ask staff and they have identified some funding that would be available to help plan this park that becomes available later this year, that would not be available to fund any of the other unfunded needs that we have for resiliency or parks or whatever else. And I think that if we were to give direction, I think tonight we need to make a a recommendation based on the the resources we have. Because I sat in a meeting today with our traffic and traffic safety folks and talked about all the needs they have. And I and I've heard from other departments about the needs that are, you know, that are coming forward and mid-cycle. I don't know where additional staffing is going to come, but I can't vote on something today. Assuming that in June I'm going to vote on it on a vote to approve another position for rec and park specifically because I haven't seen what all those with all the. So far. So for me, I'd like to see something that maybe gives direction. I like the way that, that, that, that, that this was presented as a priority and it was a presented in the win there. You know, we have the part that sorry. So I didn't want to go too late losing my ability to to think I like the fact that the that the rec and park commission and the staff report really laid out like let's do the things we we are already doing, let's finish the things we have already started. And then where it doesn't conflict and interfere and keep us from doing those things, we should also then start to work. And so I think whether it's the and I don't remember if it's probably a I think it was the the funding source funds that become available later this year. If we were able to write a grant that successfully got us a consultant who could actually do the planning so it could actually expand the resources we have in order to move forward on something like this. I think that would be a fantastic opportunity and so I'd be more than happy to support something like that. Thank you. As long as I'm on my left hand side. Councilmember Vella, do you want to go next? So I. I appreciate the work that's gone into this. I defer a little bit from my colleague in that when I look at the staff report in terms of the new park projects, it says Park No Direction received council referral from November 2019, but it was actually also talked about even prior to November of 2019. We had, I think in the first my first year on council, we had extensive conversations about De Park. And I do know that we've discussed in terms of the two water park kayak launch, but we also have some other water based parks that are coming along that are through developer projects. I. I would like to see us really start to focus on depth in terms of while we might not necessarily be funding things right away, we need to start seeing it show up in plans and then figuring out what the pathway forward is. And I understand that staff has limited amount of time to work on things, but I think we have a lot of nice parks throughout Alameda. It's one of the the things that makes Alameda. Alameda, but if we don't put d pave on the map and start carving out some time for it, I do have concerns that it's going to continue to be this item where we have not given clear direction to actually do that. So I want to do that tonight. I want to say, please move pave up on this list and and tell us what what are the next steps that where, you know, what do we need to do to to start making it a little more of a place? Because I remember Councilmember Marta Rossi brought this up when I was first here in the issues were signage and things like that. And we were told we can't do that because it would create liability issues. But it's it's basically sitting out there with a ton of potential. And we're not we're not doing anything with it. And it is this concrete wasteland. And I don't want to see that happen to what could be a very nice space. And I understand that there's all of these other, you know, state pressures coming down for other things. But I want to make sure that West Alameda and I know we've got Jean Sweeney and we've got the Cross Alameda Trail opening up through our Pizarro Parkway and things like that. But I want to make sure that De Pave doesn't get forgotten. And I think that it could play a key part in our climate action plan. So I'd like to see it prioritized higher. Councilmember de SAG. Well, thank you very much to Parks Director Woolridge and her presentation. And the map is very helpful in letting not just council members but the public see the breadth of new projects that were doing throughout Alameda not not just the east end of town but but but thankfully so much is happening on the west end of town . So I am I am so happy to see this map that's presented here. And I love all those little. Shovels, too. You know, I certainly welcome staff's recommendation, but I certainly also want to hear what my colleagues say in terms of, you know, how they would like to prioritize matters. You know, in terms of D Pave Park, I certainly join Councilmember Ody as well as all the other council members in in supporting De Pave Park largely because it's it's a different type of park, you know. I mean, we we in our minds, we have a certain thing about parks and how they function in our neighborhoods and how they look. But D pave in a way is is that not thinking out of the box for the sake of thinking out of the box, but thinking out of the box because there's a functional aspect to it with regard to climate change. And we can certainly be one city that that shows other cities how when it comes to planning parks, we can do it intentionally with regard to climate change. So that's why I certainly support I supported Councilmember Odie when he brought forward the matter again several months ago. Thank you for her for for letting me join you on that. And and I'm glad to see that there's not only community support, but that that our Parks and Rec and I also vetted this as well. So I look forward to what my colleagues have to say. Councilmember Alley, thank you. I'll be quick. I also appreciate all the work that Amy and her staff has done. It was nice to walk home from the event on Saturday and basically almost walk entirely through parks between Jean Sweeney and Lydecker Park. I was only a block away from home, so that was really great and it was a nice day too. So I think this council has a chance to go down, as you know, the most climate friendly council that we've ever had. We did the climate emergency. We did the Climate Action Plan. We hired the sustainability person or we didn't hire them. We authorized the money today. And now, you know, we have an opportunity to prioritize a park. You know, that could be state of the art. You look around the world, you know, Hong Kong has these wetlands park right on the edge of of of development, you know, huge, huge, huge populated cities. So the advocates of this park, you know, did what was asked of them. We sent this to the Park and Rec Commission. They evaluate it and they put it at the top after the two parks that are already in process. So I think we need to respect that, that decision. So I'd like to move to accept the recommendation. Would you mind if I had a chance? I want to make the motion because then we can have discussion. But I want to move to approve the priorities and then with direction to staff, to hire a consultant to develop this master plan and ballpark the cost and get this back to us by the end of July. So I'm going to speak next. That motion hasn't been seconded yet. I am I almost. A rule that you have to do a motion first before discussion. So. Okay, well then I will just comment that I was actually going to make my comments first, but I decided to respect your ability to go next. Okay. It's been moved. It's been seconded in my turn to discuss, I think, the hours getting late here. I also want to commend Ms. Wooldridge. That was an outstanding staff report you put together and the exhibits were great and I love the map. I have. I have much the same map on my wall, but it doesn't have all the new I might need to get a new map. But I also very much respect the Recreation Park Commission. I know that Ms.. Aldridge is extremely pleased with their composition. I think they're doing a good job for us. And so I, I think, you know, I think everything the council has said tonight is true and correct, including the points that the vice mayor made about we do have a climate action resiliency plan, and this wasn't a part of it. But I think we can in this particular matter, we can do it. Also, I would support the staff recommendation, which is to and it seems I can almost move forward on two tracks because the funding streams would be different because there are is this funding that is specific to the sort of park that. Park is. So I would support following the recommendation of the the Recreation Parks Commission to have the three priorities. But the two along the the waterfront on the East End followed by D paved park but they might even be moving forward kind of simultaneously insofar as going after funding that apparently you've been asked to to apply for. So if that is indeed the motion, I support it to. Okay. For the commission. So. Of course. Yeah. I guess I felt my comments were very aligned with the staff report and the recommendation of the of the park. But the motion then got into directing staff to hire an engineer and be back in July, which I don't think is. But also, I'm not clear where the funding is coming from that. And I'm wondering if we can talk about what what is what is not going to happen. You know what? I will just ask for clarification from the speaker. I'm sorry. I was trying to get a word in edgewise and so I wasn't probably listening as closely to. Can you tell us what Motion Councilmember Odie made was? It was to move from all of the except the staff recommendation about the priorities with direction is staff to hire a consultant that would be returned back by July. Oh. Before the budget process. They. Okay. So that. Well, say it again if you would like. It was to move acceptance of the staff recommendation on the priorities with directions of staff to hire a consultant that would return back in July. The matter. So I guess my my question is to the maker of the motion, where what funding are we using for that? Because we haven't we haven't budgeted for that. I think I'll leave that up to the the staff to figure that out. I mean, they were going to do these other projects also. So. Right. So what funding is there for those projects? Okay. So. I mean, the idea was to send it back to the Park and rec to prioritize on the budget they have on which ones they would focus on. And we don't even know how much this one's going to cost. That's why we want this done. It could be so cost prohibitive that we decide we're never going to do this. I don't know. Well, so as long as we're discussing, I think I another way to approach it might be to hold off on the direction to hire until we've had our mid-cycle budget discussions in that. Well, I don't know how much it cost to develop an RFP. I can't imagine it's like super expensive. Well, it's a little different than a fully loaded salary. I think we could agree to that. I mean, I would envision staff drafting an RFP, which I think they probably have them on the shelf that would require minor modifications. And then whatever the consultant I mean, they're not that expensive. I'm sure they're under the amount that even the city manager can approve. I don't even know if it has to come back to us. My concern is just taking things outside of the budget process when we're so close to contemplating that. But my concern is that this idea keeps getting kicked down the road and now we have an opportunity. We did what we were asked to do, which was take it to the Park Commission and get prioritized. So do we just leave it there or do we actually do something about it? Because maybe the intention was we thought we could kill it there, but it didn't die. So we need to keep it keep it moving. I I'm I'm sorry. I am troubled by that. The suggestion that we sent things to the, the Recreation and Parks Commission, a very hardworking commission to be killed, I think they took their mission very seriously, and I think they came back with a good recommendation. Councilmember De So you wanted to say something. In terms of the RFP for a consultant when when the July timeline was mentioned, that wasn't for the consultant to finish the work, is that correct? That was just the to the time by which we would select a consultant. Is that correct? Yes. Really? Yeah. So that we would have peace and people would come back with their proposals and then we would select somebody and then, you know, that would pretty much align with this December date to. Yeah. Okay. I am the city manager. Do you want to add anything? I was going to ask the rec and park director to come up. Here and just the introduction that she was seeking. Do you want to consult with as. Far as timing of how long it would take to do an RFP for this particular type of function? That would be one question, and I don't even know if you have a projection on what the budget for this type of console would be. I haven't delved into it enough to know the budget for a consultant. If I can tell you that the consultant to do the master planning process for the pool was about $68,000, so it could be roughly on that order of magnitude. Regarding time frame, I'm a little unclear. Normally for this type project, when we do a request for proposals, we don't bring choice for those consultants. Back to Council for decision. That's a different level of RFP on the development side, but not on this level. So. So the way it normally works is I identify funding prior to doing an RFP because I can't necessarily choose somebody and then say I need you to hold for a couple of months until I can get it in front of council because it takes us. It takes me at least if I have staff reports done and contracts done and everything I have, I need at least a month to get in front of the City Council because the Sunshine Ordinance, the RFP process itself, they're a little bit off the shelf is the term I heard. However, this is, as was mentioned, a very unique park. So you want to find the right kind of consultant. Someone who designs a baseball field is not necessarily somebody that you want designing this unique type of park, so you want someone that has the ecological. And so I would need to get more educated. I haven't built this type of park before. I need to reach out to my resources to get educated, to make sure we find the right consultant and don't waste our money on someone who wasn't correct. So I need at least a few weeks to do that. Generally, we have an RFP open for 30 days and it generally takes us about a month or so to pull together an interview, panel interview and some more time to get it under contract. It's usually anytime a type of RFP or bid process is about a three month process. So we would. Council member Rudy. Thank you. Would the beginning of September be reasonable to come back with? Whatever bids you get and then a budget request on whether we if we choose to accept one of those bids or authorize you to accept one of those bids, I really don't need to pick myself. You know, can you? I think I see Mr. Leavitt wanting to add something maybe he can. Recommend is that she put that in as one of your budget requests and then you can consider that during the mid-cycle. In May. Correct. Early May. In May. June. Yeah. And that I mean, that's fine to. It's just I still think we need to get the RFP issued. If you need more than two weeks or three weeks or four weeks to do that, then tell us how much you need. But at least we can get that out there. Councilmember Vela, did you want to say something? I think my concern and be this concern shared by my colleague is that if we don't at least start drafting the RFP and working on the RFP, we'll get proposals back. And we can we can put it in the in the budget cycle to actually say, okay, do we want to move forward? But if we don't actually start working on figuring out what the RFP would look like, then we're really falling further behind. So I have a suggestion. What if as part of this motion we include direction to include in the budget, the mid-cycle budget, the position of a position for a consultant for this specific unique part, because I don't think it's just any park park consultant. So with that and councilmember already to your concern that somehow and Councilmember Vela, I'm trying to be mindful of the concerns you're you're articulating. You don't want to see this pushed farther down the road. I'm here to tell you, it's the first meeting in March. We're talking about the beginning of May when this would come back. And it's you know, I think I mean, I think everyone on this council is saying, yes, let's do this. But I just think that it's a little a little neater, a little more adhering to a good budget project, a process to include them, include this position with specific direction to staff to come back with working that into the budget. Well, I agree with that idea, but I also think it should include some hard deadline on an RFP if that budget position is approved. I mean, whether that's whether May is too soon. I think I get that, whether June is too soon or July. But, you know, some day because. And and I understand that's your opinion. My feeling based on years of experience with Mr. Aldridge in the projects he's brought before us is that she gets the job done. And so I think that if we give direction that this is the will as a council and we're asking for that position in the budget, I don't feel the need to then, you know, double check her by telling her a date certain. And also we've heard her say that this isn't just any old park consultant and it might take just a little longer. But I don't. I don't. Speaking for myself, I'm certainly not trying to delay what you're trying to accomplish. So I didn't I didn't say you did it, but I. I said I also know that our Amy does what we asked to do, but she's done a lot. I went to that meeting and heard all of that. So this is not on the agenda. I think you need more people, but that's not for today's discussion. So I trust that you'll do what what you need to do. But we've given you a lot, just like we given the traffic people and we've given everybody else a lot, but. I mean, if maybe in the in the budget request, there is some some deadline put in that request, then, you know, that might work too. Councilmember Vela. I would like it to come back before you know, before I've been on the council for four years because we have been talking about this specific space for literally the entire time I've been on council and it continues to come up is kind of here's the placeholder for it. And I just want to make sure that whatever direction we're giving, it's clear enough that it doesn't come up again is on the list, but no council direction and no timeline. And I think that that's what we're trying to achieve. I'm fine if you know, if if as part of the budget process, it has a date certain to come back in the fall, but I would like it to come back prior to. Well, I think in the budget it could come back sooner than the fall, the budget hearings early May. That's fine. I think the question is she saying we're hearing from the director that putting together the RFP is going to take time. So I think part of the direction should be to at least do some of the background work to identify what would need to even go in the RFP. I might imagine that in order to put an item into the budget, there needs to be a little research about, you know, who that would be and how much it would cost. It is 1130, folks. So who wants to do. Can I just I guess I'm just unclear on what what I get the prioritization and moving the park forward and everything else. I'm not clear on what the RFP and what we're the motion is to hire an engineer, which I don't think is the type of thing we need to hire for this project. I'm sure that there will be engineers that are consulted at some point in time, but we don't even have a we have a minor concept, right? We have a high level. What what may I actually ask a legal question really quickly when you just stuck something in my mind? So this recommendation in the staff report is to approve the Park and Recreation Facilities Project priorities. Are we getting beyond the scope of what we were asked to do in this staff report. I think is part of the prioritization. The council could certainly give direction about timing, right? It's I think the council probably wouldn't want to go into budgeting and deciding whether or not you want a budget for an engineer. But I think if you were to just if the council direction was a particular deadline for a particular project, that's generally consistent with prioritization. A particular deadline for what? For a milestone. Right. Which is what I'm hearing from at least some of the council members. You want a milestone from a high priority for a high priority project to come back to the council that yeah, that's within the ambient prioritization. But obviously the council shouldn't be, you know, establishing budgets making very. I'm a little worried about date certain to come back with a date certain to come back with a RFP is that is that. I think you're I mean that the staff may have concerns about operationally whether or not they could do it. But I think because you're prioritizing you're simply saying I think what I'm hearing is that I want the first step of this process to come back to the council in the next three months. And that's the direction I think that's reasonable to give. As part of prioritization. We did it on six B, so we've already done that once tonight. I guess, Mayor Knox. Could we could we just clarify the motion so that it right now, I think it's almost meaningless that the engineer part. So if the question is that we want some sort of a plan with funding, etc.. Because we can't do an RFP. We don't know how we're funding this. I'd like to know if we're going if we're making a decision and it doesn't sound like we can actually say spend money on something specifically tonight, I'd like to know what we're not doing because we don't have a budget that's just the park slush fund. So could we. Knowing that knowing following the mayor's recommendation, knowing the budget is coming in two months, could we ask that there be a proposal with funding and a timeline for moving this, for moving to the next phase of this park, which I would imagine is some sort of an RFP for a planning process for. What will be a large and interesting park. Mr. Levitt, what do you think? Yeah, I think you could do that. As far as timing, I would agree with that. If you said you wanted to have the console come back, we would put this as the number one priority. Priority, because it's the first time that you said you want this to be in the mid-cycle. So if we don't have enough funding the mid-cycle, we'd cut something in there or we would put this before other other priorities if because it's the only one that you've prioritized at this point. I mean, why? Sorry. I mean, this is only if you said that, but is it consultants only? It's not only, but it's 60000 to 80000 to what I'm guessing. Well, I think I'm hearing that we're prioritizing all three. Well, what I heard was to have a consultant hired for this. For this particular one. Madumere, please do things. Maybe we should do the time. Yeah, I'd like to. Okay, so we said that at 1130, we would decide if we were going to go beyond 1132 here items. 99 BE. Yeah. And I'm okay with that hearing them or not hearing them or hearing on the hearing. It takes four votes. And I don't think that we're going to be more productive as the hour goes on. So I won't be supporting that. And did I hear the vice mayor say he wouldn't either? Okay. Okay, I. Okay. So back to this. Um, my comment. That was in your comment now. Yes, yes, yes. My comment now. Go ahead. Thank you. I think I will certainly join my colleagues in prioritizing Deep Park, largely because I do believe that there is community support for moving Dave Park forward, not just the support that I've seen recently, but it's the support that has been there for. I mean, it was there when in my first go around 2012. 2016. Right. So. So, yeah. Who's counting? So, so I do think that there's community support behind it and the fact that it was prioritized high. So but I also respect the fact that Parks Director Woolridge, as well as our city executive staff are making are are causing us to make sure to put together an RFP that reflects our best judgment and research. And my hope is that all of that can be done within some time frame that's more immediate than not immediate. And at some point in time, if someone says September 2020, they'd like to see an RFP start moving forward. I'm okay with that, that that falls within my timeframe. Do I have to prescribe it tonight? I don't know. But I do want to express my support and certainly moving forward, Dave Park because I do think that we're we're working on behalf of the people. Okay. Thank you. Well said, Ms. Wooldridge. If I could make a proposal so I'm more than happy to bring back a plan on D Pave Park, on what steps it'll take, what the funding is, what the timeline could be. If I could bring that later before our summer recess, somewhere around June, July. By that point, we may know more about potential funding sources for the Aquatics Center and what could or could not be happening with that. And so there's some other big projects that we'll know more at that point. And her and at that point, we may also have some decisions on whether there's additional staffing for the Recreation Department to help with this. Because then I can also do at that point is give you an update on okay, here's the D Pave Park plan. And if if staffing doesn't come during the mid cycle, here's what other projects will be delayed and by how long to refocus on this, because I guarantee other projects will get delayed. It could be the aquatic center. It could be for inside. It could be a lot of other projects that will get significantly delayed. If I refocus on it was fine and that's your purview to determine, but I can give you that what that balance looks like when we have more information by June, July. During that time, I'm more than happy to start researching and figuring out what goes into an RFP of this type and start planning on an RFP. There's no funding attached to developing an RFP, and that's certainly fine. How does that sound? It sounds good to me. Okay. Do you want to do you want to recraft your motion? So just adopt everything she said when she said, I can I say that here. Did you get that, Madam Quirk? Does that work for the city manager? Is it that that will give us the outcome that we want? And the city clerk says she got all that. So okay, so we have it. We have an amended motion. Do we have a second? Second and it's been seconded. Okay. So any questions now? Okay. All in favor I any opposed you abstained. That passes unanimously. Thanks, everyone. Good melding of the minds. Okay, so where are we? Besides, it's getting late.

Thank you. And we have a okay. And so we have Assistant City Attorney John Lay to do the staff report. Good evening. Madam Mayor. Members of the council, members of the public. John Lee, on behalf of the city of Alameda, Alameda City Attorney's Office. I'll keep my remarks brief. And just be sure that you speak right into the microphone so everybody who's out, you're seeing. Things. So our office was charged with preparing amendments to the Sunshine Ordinance, and we did that in consultation with the city manager's office. And we worked very closely with the city clerk's office, in part because they have a great deal of institutional memory and knowledge in this area, and we thank them for their assistance on that. I'd also like to acknowledge the Open Government Commission when we prepared the amendments which ended it for their discussion and recommendation, and they provided us with very thoughtful and thorough analysis. And I just want to state that we respect the work that they do, and we want to I want to thank them for the input that they provided and the ordinance currently that you have before you. Proposes ten amendments. The first thing I want to do is sort of emphasize that. In nine out of the ten amendments, our office and city staff and the Open Government Commission were able to find common ground. Nine out of the ten we were in agreement. There were probably two minor amendments to those nine, and our office agreed with those amendments as recommended by the Open Government Commission, and those amendments are reflected in the staff report. That is, of course, leaves one amendment that there wasn't such agreement, which is sort of the elephant in the room I'm referring to, obviously the null and void remedy. You might recall that our office did prepare an opinion on this remedy, and I'm not here to reiterate or rehash any of that. I will just simply say that we continue to hold that opinion and we have been keeping an open mind in terms of new facts or law. And that hasn't changed. But I'm I do want to emphasize that if the council does wish to make the amendments as proposed by our office and staff, what sort of remains, even if it were removed and the agency would still have many of the matters they currently have within their purview, they'd still be able to review council actions and all boards and commissions subordinate to the council. They would still be able to impose fines for violations of both portions of the ordinance, public meetings, public records. And they would also, based on our recommendation, be able to make recommendations concerning the complaints that they hear so they could make a recommendation, for example, to care and correct. That would still be within their purview, even if the council chooses to take out an old board remedy. So I'd like to close with this idea that the the amendments here before you are actually the result of great civic engagement, you know, fierce advocacy on the part of the agency for greater transparency through thoughtful legal analysis, not just from our office, but also members of the public. And with that, we recommend that you adopt excuse me, introduce the ordinance up first reading based on staff's recommendation. If you have any questions, I'm here to answer them. So, counsel, before we hear from our public speakers. Does anyone have any clarifying questions about the report? Councilmember Vela Yes, I'll go ahead and start ahead of Councilman Brody so that he doesn't have to lead on every might. My question is, who recommended that this provision, this null and void provision, be added to the ordinance? How how did it come about? I will say that I tried my best to research the issue on my own, and I wasn't able to determine. I know there have been allegations that it was actually prepared by a member of the city attorney's office, none of whom are currently here. I don't know the definitive answer. To tell you the truth. Okay. And then. And. Similarly, are there any other cities that have a similar commission or body that that has this type of power? So our cities. Understood. And so when we started this process and we did do some research on other cities that have sunshine ordinances. Actually, the First Amendment coalition keeps a great list of all the cities. As you can imagine, it's a topic of their utmost concern. And we identified 14 jurisdictions that we surveyed and none that we were aware of, and that was probably six months ago, roughly had this null and void remedy and sort of in a bunch of caution. And to make sure that we are thorough, we actually serve those jurisdictions again to see if any changes were made and none that I'm aware of. Did you review the meeting, the meeting minutes from when this ordinance was enacted as part of your research? I did I did review the meeting minutes. My recollection was that they were quite sparse. Maybe they were more action minutes. I do recall reviewing the tape as well. Thank you. Then, Mr. Abbott. Councilman Brody? Yeah, well, let's go. I mean, it just makes up the order a little bit. Councilmember Desai, you go next. Is a quick question. Was the concept of null and void, was that in the original ordinance that resulted in the creation of the of the AGC? And so at least so if so, then we know a time at which point it was adopted. So I obviously wasn't here when that was adopted. My recollection was that the Sunshine Ordinance was adopted around the same time. That is that the sort of organic statute that created or memorialized the duties and powers of the Open Government Commission, they were around the same time as my understanding it's in a different chapter of the AMC , but it was around the same time. Okay. Quick question. And it's more of a broad question, and I don't know if now's a good time to answer it, but I'll ask it nonetheless. What harm is there if we keep the concept of null and void in the ordinance? What kind of harm results from that? Sure. And it's hard to tell with a crystal ball. I mean, obviously you've got our opinion out there. And so it's a null and void remedy is used again. There is this sort of incongruence about where our office stands and obviously our office is opinion may or may not change, but there there's that risk. Okay. Thank you. And I would just ask Mr. Lay for those in the audience in watching who might not have reviewed the staff report. In your opinion, can you just encapsulate a little bit about the the precedent that this would set and. Sure. You know, one thing that I've remarked time and again about this remedy is that although it's been in there since its inception, I think it's been used only recently. And are you asking sort of for the for the legal position I'm sorry. I shouldn't make this a guessing game. I highlighted in the staff report on page six of of of your staff report about the middle of the page, a little below that the well, you describe how the city council's authority to legislate locally stems from its constitutionally granted charter charter city powers. Sure. And you quote some legal authorities noting the limitation on the power to delegate legislative authority and then talk about the null and void that I'm. Happy to bring. I want to take it from there. Yeah, I think there are really to I mean, if you look at this from sort of a lost perspective, I mean, the general. Wants one. Yeah, yeah. The general rule is the one that we're citing. And there have been refinements to that general rule. But the general rule essentially states that when you have a policymaking body that's vested with it, with the power, with various powers, and in this case the legislative power to make local law, they cannot delegate that authority. And what is meant by that is that and the purpose behind that is to is to ensure that the policymaking body makes the fundamental policy decisions. Now, there has been some refinements on this general rule over time, including Supreme Court precedent. Ah, Supreme Court, California Supreme Court that talks about when you can do delegation. But we view that authority as separate from sort of the general rule. So the question really for us is, is does the null and void remedy, where does it fall within the law, within the jurisprudence? Is that more of the general rule or is it the refinement? And the refinement is one that you're all very familiar with. You've done it multiple times where you make the overarching decision, the fundamental policy decision, and you leave on to some executive or employee to decide how to fill in the blanks, because it's fully recognized by the courts that the Council can't make every single policy decision possible to ensure that every eventuality is provided for. Instead, what's recognized is the Council may make sort of a fundamental and you did this with the rent ordinance, you did this with cannabis, and you've done it with various other ordinances where you create this regulatory regime, you decide that that's what you want to do and you let staff. Fill in the blanks. And for us, we don't believe the null and void remedy falls within that second bucket where you're just filling in the blanks. That's not what's occurring here, at least in our view. For us, it's more of a fundamental policy decision, in part because the power to make local law includes the power to repeal it. And for us, we feel it falls more into that box. I hope that. Thank you. Thank you. And kills over disagree. You finish with your clarifying questions. You can go. No, no, stay with you and then we'll go to accountability. On this subject matter. Some have pointed to Article three, Dash two, as language that allows policymaking boards to establish concepts like the null and void. And they're the way that I receive emails about, you know, referencing 3-2 is when people write the council. May three, Dash two says the council may confer upon any board or office powers and duties. Now, is it correct, though, that there is a part of 3-2 that oftentimes is left out? And that part is the predicate because a full reading of 3-2 is the council may confer upon any board or office powers and duties, and the missing predicate seems to be additional to those set forth in the charter so that we can. What that means is the council can confer upon boards and policymaking bodies, powers and duties, but it has to be consistent with certain parts of the city charter. So if the city charter says that ultimate power making authority rests with the city council, which it does in section three, dash one. Mm hmm. Yeah, I agree. I think that's certainly one possible interpretation of it. Sort of the meaning of additional and whether it means additional to those powers, to those boards and commissions that are actually , you know, set forth into the charter. That's certainly probably the easiest interpretation to take, that it's additional to those. So if not so stated, it's not clear that it's provided for. I think that's sort of the gist of your point. Thank you. Okay, Councilman Brody, thank you. My questions are on other sections, so hopefully you can answer them. So going to the. I think it's. Section one, Part D policy body shall mean the following blah blah, blah. Okay. I'm looking at the the draft ordinance, but I think that's what it is. Yeah. So I mean, there's the housing authority board fall under that purview. Under the definition of a policy body, right. I don't believe so, because I it's not clear to me that they make policy on. Well, they certainly I know that there they observed the the Brown act and so their their meetings are agenda I's a need a lot of the sort of parallel requirements that we have in our sunshine ordinance. Now now if you're asking if they are sort of fall within the purview of the Sunshine Ordinance, you know, I have not thought about that. Can you? I could look this up, but could you remind me what? Five, four, 952. Is that what. That that that's the portion of the Brown Act that actually defines what a legislative. Body. So that's the Brown acts. Somehow their subject has a policy body under the Brown Act. So we're defining a policy a policy body as it's defined under the Brown Act. So it would think I would think that they would also be subject to our Sunshine Ordinance as well. Understood. I you know, as I sit here, as I stand here in front of the dias, I mean, I that sounds like a sensible interpretation. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't know that we've actually sort of connected those dots. Okay. I want to hear from the city attorney, Ben san, please. So, Councilmember, I believe that because the housing authority is currently a separate legal entity, much like the school district, they're not subject to the Sunshine Ordinance. Okay. Maybe we could suggest that they adopted voluntarily. So my second question, maybe I'll go back to the way my colleague was describing it. So two Dash 91, dash five. Mm hmm. So the audience requires all documents material to an agenda item accompany the agenda. So, I mean, we just had an instance today. I know there's a lot of work that needs to be done to put these presentations together, but I mean, should that presentation, which I mean, arguably was material to an agenda item, I mean, should that have been something that was part of the agenda or. Or is that an exemption? And if it's an exemption, then maybe this is not something we want to put in there. Which presentation. I'm sorry. On the traffic. B Oh, I wasn't here for the traffic spillage. I'd say sometimes. We have presentations that accompany agenda items should be put on the agenda and sometimes we get them at the last minute. So I'm just wondering where that type of presentation would fall under to Dash 91.5? I'm not sure, but I can I can tell you that sort of the intent of the of the amendment was to really just take the language and ensure that it's not just sort of general materiality, in other words, just general relevance to relevance to the entire topic and more about, you know, what the agenda, what the action that's being taken. So we were trying to kind of narrow that a bit so that it was a lot more clear. And I'm I'm not sure that I've answered you, but. I mean, who is to decide if it's materials at the object's job. I suppose it would be if there was a violation or or alleged violation. Okay. Yeah. I mean, to me, it's just it's unclear. Sure. If it's unclear, then it opens up room for interpretation and controversy. So. Sure and. Little concerned. About that. I understood. And I would just. So I will just remind people we're asking clarifying questions about the staff report. Council will have ample time after we've heard our public speakers to do a discussion. Now, make not just one note just really quickly and I don't want to leave the impression that the logic will simply be sort of grasping in the dark to figure out what this means. The object is staffed by our office, so they would have the ability to consult our office in terms of determining whether or not there was a violation or what was considered material in light of these changes. Okay. And then my last question was, so you have to dash 91 that 1515, which there was a discussion about that vis a vis resolution 15382 which prohibits ceding of time. And then we have to dash 93.7, which says this provision states that all local laws inconsistent with the ordinance are superseded. So I mean, is that 15382 kind of in conflict with two dash 93.7. I'm sorry, where's the conflict in the two sections? Well, the the Sunshine Ordinance allows you to cede time right and point a spokesperson and 15382 got rid of that option and that's but yet the Sunshine Ordinance says it takes precedence over anything else. So I just wonder if there might have been an issue there. Sure. But I'm not aware of it conflicting anywhere else. And to the extent that it does, we can certainly address that in a subsequent amendment. But we did want to clarify that. We wanted it to be consistent with council adopted resolution. Right. We primarily made the to the extent permitted by law to clarify. Mr. Lane, I'm going to interrupt you just so your boss can speak. Mister said. So. Council Member I think your point is well taken that the the sunshine ordinance does. You're right the sunshine ordinance allows speakers to see time 15382 does not. And given that one of the reasons we're bringing this forward to you is is our thinking that because you when you adopt it 15302 later, that that is the policy the council wants to effectuate. And therefore, we're proposing the amendment to make the Sunshine Ordinance consistent with the Council's will on that particular issue. If if that is not the Council's will, we're happy to additional changes. Well, that was clairement. So then the final question. Sorry. So then does it are we applying that to the 93.7 prospectively or retrospectively? Only it would have to be prospectively, I believe. I mean, unless we have a provision that states that it's going to be retrospective, there's a general rule against retrospective. But it sounds like. Retroactivity. Skews it sounds like we did kind of make it retroactive. That said, if we do if. There's something written before then. This supersedes it. But going forward. Well, you can think about that. We can talk about it when it's time to discuss. Okay. Any further clarifying questions of counsel before we go to our public speakers? Let's go to our public speakers. And we now have eight speakers. So. So when we have eight speakers, the individual speaking time goes down to 2 minutes. But rest assured, 2 minutes is a pretty good, long period of time. So to keep things moving along, my goal is always to get us out on the same evening that we started the meeting. I will. And again, no cheering boos doing the wave, what have you. I'm just listened respectfully to speakers, but listen for your name. If you're the next speaker, put yourself out in a position to be next to the podium. Okay. I'm Adam Clark. We have Susan Hauser, Steve Larson, then Bill Smith. Okay. Good evening, Honorable Mayor Ashcraft, Vice Mayor Knox White and council members. The League of Women Voters of Alameda was a strong advocate for the development of the Open Government Commission or the Commission and participated in its development through the Sunshine Task Force in 2010. You are now being asked to reconsider your decision and remove the main enforcement mechanism from the Commission. We request that you oppose doing so. The Commission stated that the enforcement role is essential to our democracy and the main purpose for the Commission's existence. The City Attorney states that the City Council cannot delegate or grant legislative authority to the Commission, implying that the enforcement provision is legislative. It is not legislative. This enforcement authority did not abdicate any of the City Council's legislative power. The Commission simply evaluates and rules on process issues, not the merits of the Council's legislative action. In summary, the enforcement provision is not legislative. We recommend that after a complaint about improper process is filed, you suspend further action until the Commission has had time to investigate before holding the next and certainly the final hearing on the legislation . The Open Government Commission is more likely to be viewed by the public as a neutral arbiter of council adherence to legislative procedures than the Council itself. The Commission has also proven to be a more accessible arbiter than a court system that requires expensive attorneys. We urge the City Council to reject the proposed amendments to the penalty section of the Sunshine Ordinance. Thank you. Thank you. Steve Larson. Then Bill Smith, then Kurt Peterson. Good evening, Mayor Ashcraft, council members. I'm Steve Swanson and I'm here to speak in opposition to the proposed ordinance and to demand it be tabled. I want you all to understand that it's not that we don't trust you. It's just that we don't trust you. You haven't done any favors for the people of Alameda in the last two or three years with this million dollar payout to the former city manager helping yourself to $40,000, borrow money to pay your personal attorney's fees, holding a special election costing the people of Alameda $700,000 for the sole benefit of one developer and failing to bill that developer for the $700,000 additional cost. And lastly, you're not doing the people of Alameda any favors by trying to tamper with Measure A. The sunshine ordinance is put here and we want to keep that sunshine shining on your conduct. Respectfully request that you table this ordinance. Thank you. Thank you. And the next speaker is Bill Smith. Mayor Ashcroft, Vice Mayor Knox White and council members. I want to thank you by living by the spirit of the Sunshine Ordinance, a marijuana bill. You passed it, but you went back and reheard it later, eventually. So thank you for that. As you just heard from Mr. Sjöström, there are a number of people in the community that don't trust the council for a number of things. And I think this is an opportunity for you to earn back some of that trust for certain areas. And and that is by keeping the Open Governance Commission, making sure that they have enforcement powers. And so the preferred option is, as you heard from the League of Women Voters, to leave the null and void in and work for that. And you heard the we have a couple of attorneys, Robert Sumwalt and Paul Foreman, both have opinions that would slant more and direction of the alternative, that this council does have the power to delegate, that those things you might find that the housing authority and also the electrical utility probably make policy, too, is my bet. And the housing authority used to be part of the city at one point. So what happened and I think it was during the time the Sunshine Ordnance was in effect, that's another opportunity you might have had. There's also a procedural way to do this. You can just decide, okay, you're going to suspend, as you heard the league, when voters ask you suspend all action. And once somebody files a complaint and it never becomes law, so it doesn't have to be declared null and void, you just suspend action until it's clear whether it's a sunshine committee and you've heard and you've disposed of the the complaint. And then you can also in an emergency. If this I know something's come up an emergency ordinance, you're going to require something like a five unanimous vote of all sitting council members, which would be five, to go ahead and override the the sunshine the government committee to get something passed in a hurry if there is a complaint about it. So you have an opportunity here to maintain confidence, increase confidence. Thank you, Mr. Smith. And the next speaker is. Curt Peterson, then Paul Foreman, then Trish Spencer. Okay. Good evening. I already introduced myself earlier. I'm not surprised, Jim, that you don't remember a lot of things about that first meeting. Mr. Peterson. We do not countenance ad hominem attacks from the podium. Will restart your time. But you are not here to address individual council members, but the entire body. Wait a. Second. It's an actual fact. Mayor, I can't state fact. I was making a point that I too do not remember all the things that were in the Commission's bylaws and rules. It was presented to us by our city attorney, Janet Kern, at that time. Okay. Laura was also there. Jim, was there two other people besides myself who were the original people on the commission were there. We took the bylaws without any question, no discussion whatsoever about it. I brought up one key point in that is someone makes a complaint and that if the board doesn't uphold their decision or what their ruled, the ruling was in their favor, that they were banned for making a request. Again, I think three or five years. Well, a long time. I thought that was inappropriate. But the bottom line is, we were given the the right to do that. That hasn't changed. That was in the original one. I want to say, whoever the attorneys team here brought up more questions than answers about this new ordinance that you're talking about. I cannot believe you would respond to it. He can't give us any answers. It's kind of like the same defense Republicans are doing as far as in the Senate right now. I want some answers. Not well, I don't know. The bottom line is, if you had a city attorney that was doing their job the night that this was in question, they should have actually aired with caution rather than not saying we're going to go along with it. I don't see a problem. Why not just say, wait, we'll look at this. Let's take a step back. We'll make sure you're taking all the teeth and all any kind of authority that the Open Government Commission has away. And that's a shameful. Q Thank you, Mr. Peterson. Our next speaker is Mr. Foreman. And be sure to speak right into the speakers. So we get into make sure to speak right into the microphone so we can all hear you. In answer to councilman's valid question about where this all came from, read the minutes of October 18th, 2011, starting with page four. City Council knew exactly what they were doing when they passed this ordinance. They specifically said, We do not want council policing its own process. And that's what they did. They were proud of it. They unanimously passed it and their city attorney vetted it. Now, I must state that the staff report is dead wrong in saying the ordinance had not been reviewed since 2011. I served on the commission in 2015 when we reviewed the ordinance line by line and made several revisions there to a city attorney. Was there didn't say a word about this enforcement provision. Both Attorney Schwartz and myself have conducted email useful dialog with Council member Knox White, and we've written to council and to the city attorney. However, our city attorney has not seen fit to dialog with us and attempt to resolve these differences. We are not attorneys litigating against the city for the benefit of our clients. We are citizens of this community or donating our legal research in the public interest. The A.C.T. letters suggest two options that could retain significant enforcement powers in the AGC, while avoiding the issue of delegating legislative powers. If neither of those suggestions satisfy council or the city attorney, I suggest that we follow the procedure followed in 2011 before the audience with adopted appoint a Sunshine Task Force, including a representative of the City Attorney's Office to resolve our differences and present recommendations to council. I would be happy to serve on such a group. Thank you. Thank you. And Spencer, then Serena Chen, then Brian Schwartz. Good evening, counsel. Staff I agree with the city attorney's recommendation on this. I want to thank you for your research. I did hear the comments of members of the public that they do not trust council. I would submit that the response of not trusting council is not to implement something that is illegal or to continue with something that is illegal. I think the body of law and the position that the attorney, our city attorney has made is correct. This has never been challenged in our city. It's the first time it's happened. I think that's why we're all looking at it. We weren't looking at it before because it hadn't occurred. That's why we're looking at it. The night of the ordinance, when it came to us, we did look at our city attorney. They did make a decision of it being within the Brown Act. When it came up for the second reading again, the issues were made. The city attorney weighed in. This is actually the third city attorney that has ruled on has come out on this. We had Janet Kern, we had Michael Roush, and now we've had your office. They have all landed on the same position of counsel being able to move forward and take action. And so I disagree that if people don't trust the council, you don't vote them in or you recall them, you don't implement the wrong law. It is very important that this law is it is clear. And so I hope that you do. And and in regard to the Open Government Commission, they're like every other commission. They should be they make recommendations to council. They do not supersede council. They don't. So thank you very much and good job. City Attorney. Thank you. Our next speaker is Sabrina Chen Mischief. But evening, Mayor Ashcroft, members of the council. My name is Serena Chen. My middle name is Theresa, which is named after the saint of lost causes. And it starts with a T, and it rhymes with trouble. Basically, I'm the person who filed the Sunshine Ordinance complaint at the urging of several elected officials in this city, not on the council, who, after I told them what had occurred, insisted that I file a complaint and challenge this. I come to you just as a resident of Alameda of over 20 odd years, and I spent 27 years as a public advocate for smokefree, air laws and tobacco control laws. So as in that role, I've attended over 400 city councils, school board and whatever meetings in every single city in this county and in neighboring cities as well as neighboring counties. Every single time anything came up on the agenda, that was in the discussion of the city council that I attended that was different than what was being proposed in the original agenda. The city attorney or someone on that council would lean into the mic and say, Excuse me, Madam Mayor, or excuse me, but I think if we're going down this route, we need to look at whether we want to go with the provisions we have as written or whether we want to rewrite it and bring it back in two weeks. Thanks to that law, I went to the city of Dublin so many times because they kept changing provisions that I saw the hills turn from green to yellow to brown. I wanted a residency there, but it was a pain to have to adhere to the Brown Act. But it was also something that I felt was part of fairness and part of how you run a democracy and good government. Thank you, Mrs. Chen. Our next speaker is Mr. Schwartz. Yes. Madam Mayor. And Council members. My name's Brian Schwartz and the current chair of the Open Government Commission. I'm a civil rights lawyer locally. I have the greatest respect for all of your volunteerism in coming and dedicating all these hours, and also for all the citizens who come here late on a Tuesday night to do this because of their civic engagement. And that's really what I'm here talking about, because the value that we have of openness and encouraging this kind of civic engagement is why we have the Open Government Commission, and it's exactly why it's so important to reject this amendment at this time and give it some more time to figure out the right way to go about this. The I'm concerned by the city attorney representative's effort to minimize what happened with the open government, commissioned by suggesting, first of all, by burying the lead and saying we agreed on nine out of ten things when the one thing that was really driving this was the one we disagreed on. And then by saying there wasn't such agreement, when in fact unanimously and very strongly the open government commissioners appointed by all different Bense from the city rejected this idea just as they had of of of eliminating the authority and just as they had previously remanded back to council the the ordinances on the on the dispensaries. And I think that's very important. Commissioner, I'm sorry. Councilmember Desai I made it really important question, which was what harm is there here? And the answer was very telling. It was it's hard to tell. And that there's might be potentially a sort of incongruence. Okay. On the other hand, what's the harm of not eliminating null and void? I mean, I'm sorry, of eliminating null and void. It is that we have an absence of due process, Brown Act violations and people suing the city who otherwise wouldn't need to. Thank you, Mr. Schwartz. And our next speaker. That's. That's all of our speakers. Okay. Numerous speakers. No one wants to take a speaker, slip out. Okay. With that public comment is closed and we come back to the city council. Who wants to lead off on this one? Councilmember Vella. Um, so I guess I have a few more questions and incorporate them into my comments as well. In Section nine, we lay out a timeline essentially that starts from when the complaint is filed and it reads 30 business days, which is about six weeks, and that's to schedule. The hearing. And then again, a formal written decision on the matter can be at a continued meeting within 30 business days of the conclusion of the hearing or at its next regularly scheduled meeting. And I guess my question to the city attorney's office is, have we you know, it's been raised about due process and timing, and I have a concern about these kind of extended timelines. On the one hand, I, I, I understand wanting to have time for parties to meet. On the other hand, depending on the ordinance in question and the impact that it could potentially have, I'm wondering if that sort of timeline really makes sense. So do we look at that when when this recommendation was put through and why 30 business days? I mean, that's. Sure that. The. Time the 30 business days, I realize that it sounds like a long time, but part of it is informed by the process that happens to get this thing on calendar. You know, you've got to coordinate a bunch of schedules together and sometimes it doesn't always align. And if there's a question about sort of shortening that or making it more aligned with how an ordinance would be sort of rendered null and void so that or that or a clear, incorrect recommendation so that the counsel can kind of get to it in time. That's something would have to involve sort of the city clerk's office, because that's a part of the sort of the nuts and bolts that our office isn't directly responsible for, but we want to be sensitive to those needs as well. So I think my concern is we have all these other commissions are former mayor Trish Spencer referenced that we have a number of commissions. Those commissions tend to meet monthly or at least have a date held. Is it possible for us to you know, I get that they're they're they're under this ordinance meeting twice a year. But to say sunshine or open government commission, whenever a new commission is convened on an annual basis, come up with regular meeting dates, because it seems to me that it's inherently not transparent to not have kind of dates held because then the person filing the complaint doesn't necessarily know what date it could be heard on the other parties that might be of interest. Don't know when that date is, but if we have a date held and the commissioners I'm on the lead abatement JPA, for instance, and, and in October and November of every year we get together and we say, is there a, you know, third Thursday of the month that works for everyone to have this meeting? So is it possible for us? Because it seems to me that those are the types of transparency issues that potentially exist, where we could get rid of a provision that says something like 30 business days. And I'll just give you some past practice just as a little maybe hopefully helpful. You might ask. The Open Government Commission. Two meetings are on the first Monday. And so when we've had a complaint, I've always attempted to schedule on that first Monday because then, you know, that's kind of the date that people are used to and whatever. But sometimes the complaint, it can't make the date. The complaint is required to be at the hearing. So we've had to have some flexibility to accommodate both sides because the complainant is can't have the matter heard if they don't come to the hearing. That's part of the provision. And so we've had to juggle it sometimes to like a Wednesday instead or, you know, if they needed another day. But if there is a date that's on the calendar is being held, then the complainant could look at that and know that's the date that the meeting occurs. It's the same thing that happens with the RAC or the planning board. You know, if you file appeal to planning board, planning boards meetings or planning boards meetings and you basically make it work. So I'm a little concerned that and I hear what you're saying, it's it's just seems like it's odd that we're allowing potentially a delay in actually hearing a matter that I think is of concern. Because if we're trying to legislate something, I think that there needs to be some set process in an expeditious manner to achieving an outcome in that whatever the outcome may be. The other question that I have is, you know, if we remove null and void, what is the remedy? So let's say that that and again, you know, is it just that there's a recommendation and why would somebody go to the Open Government Commission as opposed to just filing in court? Because part of. This is really about getting curing the issue as soon as possible and doing it in a way that removes kind of all the legalese and removes these legal barriers of having to go to court. And so I'm just wondering what what is then the process? So Councilmember Vela, as currently proposed, the process would be that the commission would still hear the matter, just like they would do today. And if they believe that there is a violation, they would issue a recommendation to the originating body, which details their findings. And we believe that by having that recommendation and decision be issued, it serves a number of purposes. We believe that that the open and transparent nature of that decision will probably cause the original body to seriously reconsider the decision that was made. And second of all, we believe that any decision that was ultimately, you know, an unfortunate hypothetical ignored by the city, that decision would probably be accorded significant way by a court on judicial review. So we believe that that issue decision has multiple important audiences and it serves an important function. So I guess the other follow up to that is if there's how does that work? Because the city attorney's office represents the city, but then they're overseeing and advising the AGC. And if the AGC makes a recommendation against the city or against the process, that's been advised by the city, how does that work? So there's well-established judicial precedent that allows a government office to establish ethical walls when appropriate, when conflicting bodies are being represented. And this happens fairly regularly throughout the state. And I'll give another example. When there is an appeal to a personnel board, it's another perfectly good example where the city attorney's office may both be representing the decision maker, which is the Personnel Board and the Human Resources Department, who is proposing a particular discipline and judicial decisions indicate that a government office can impose ethical walls so that its lawyers can represent both functions faithfully. So I think, you know, and my questions are really about the process because I am concerned in having this be a transparent process for people to file complaints. And I want this to be more than just about the ordinance that kind of triggered this whole conversation, because there's other ordinances that we've passed through, you know, emergency ordinances and that sort of thing. And I'm concerned if there was an opportunity to say, put potentially hit pause on one of those, what the what the impact would be. But it also seems like some of these issues are process issues that perhaps and what happened with the cannabis ordinance was really unfortunate because of the timing and us going out to recess that there it snowballed into a bigger issue and there were longer delays. But it seems like maybe we could explore other procedural ways of streamlining this so that those sorts of issues don't happen and where we could region dice something and hear it sooner and have a way for the item to be heard sooner so that we can get resolution on it sooner. So that's kind of where I'm coming from. I, I guess I'm a little concerned about removing the ability to have this be a kind of decision to call, to call the question really on the council without going to court. And that's that was the value of this provision when I spoke with some of the people that were on the council at the time was that this would allow that sort of decision to be made with some teeth. But but to really put the council's feet to the fire without having to go through a long, drawn out court process. And the benefit to the city was that it wasn't a long, drawn out court process. So I'm a little concerned if that incentive goes away and you have another council in place that then doesn't really care what the logic says and moves forward and just keeps the thing on the books. And then we're in a situation where we're in court litigating over this issue. Okay. Who wants to go next? Happy to. Councilmember Desai. Well, thank you very much. You know, we do need a tool that allows us, the city council, to catch ourselves in instances when we make decisions. The details and substance of which was not publicly noticed, public noticing is key so that the public so that the people can weigh in on matters, so that they can give us their opinions on how we might vote and we on the issues that we might think about as as we deal with these public issues. NULL and void is meant to be that tool. It's meant to be that tool that deals with situations when council comes to a vote and a decision on a topic. The public wasn't properly informed about. NULL and void is a tool that supersedes a council decision and therefore represents a power that, when exercised, is above the city council. But the problem with null and void as I look at it, the problem with null and void is that it has no basis in our city charter. Instead, the city charter at Article 3-1 vests all power in the city council. It is true that in the next article, Article three, Dash two, Article three, Dash two says that the the council can delegate powers to commissions. But Article three, Dash two also says that it can only do so in a manner consistent with the charter. So it has to be consistent with the prior Article three, dash one. So to me that's an important sticking point, is understanding what is the basis of null and void and how does that align with the basis of the council's powers? Now, when we talk about powers, the city charter even becomes even more specific. When you look at, for example, Article one, dash two, dash de D, one of the powers that the city council is vested in is the ability to the ability to make and to enforce laws. And when you put it all together, three dash, two, three dash, one article, one dash, 2-d. What that means is that the City Council is invested in making powers and rules, and we can delegate that to commissions and boards, but we cannot delegate it in a way that places the council in an inferior position. And the way in which null and void is being exercised, I believe, does that. So the remedy is to correct a null and void, but still come up with a tool that deals with situations where the public isn't properly noticed. I would encourage us not to be so adamant that null and void is the only tool. It's altogether possible that members of the public, members of the Open Government Commission can come up with a variety of other tools that checks the City Council. When we make a decision that was not public informed, for example, it's altogether possible. Just thinking off the top of my head. This The Council can create an ordinance that allows the LGC to like like a football referee throw a flag. And when they throw a flag and in situations when they clearly point out that a decision was made when the public was wasn't adequately noticed, when that flag is thrown, then subsequent ordinances, council cooking come up with it is that while the decision of the council can move forward, there would still be certain penalties. For example, perhaps one of the penalties is in those decisions where the public will see what the public was not fully formed, informed. Then the council has to vote on a 4 to 1 basis on on those matters. So it becomes it doesn't altogether eliminate the the decision of the council. It just raises the bar of how to move that that issue forward. So council can still exercise its authority. In other words, these are just kind of off the top of my head ideas that that we might look at, that the public might look at as to continue to create the right check on the city council. When we I mean, there are times when we're going to make accidents, when we're going to make some decisions, when we didn't correctly publicly inform the residents. But when we create those checks, um, let's do so in a way that's aligned with the city charter. And I have no doubt that there are, there are ways, there are many ways for us to create the remedies that are similar to null and void that are and as effective. No one on this dais doubts the effectiveness of null and void. It stopped a certain decision in his track. City Council had to go back and redo that decision. No one no one doubts that. But that decision, though, has to grow out of a basis. And that basis is our city charter. And so as we correct null and void. I would hope that the Odyssey and the public as well as City Council figure out ways to do so in a way that's aligned with the city charter. And I and I have no doubt that we can. Thank you. I mean, you can buy me your next wait. Go ahead. Thank you. I I'm going to find myself in high alignment with Councilmember Desai. I appreciate the way in which he laid that out. So I was on the on the Sunshine Task Force with Jeff Mitchell, who was charged with writing the the section for the Open Government Commission, which took a section, and he was the former editor of the Alameda Journal. Transparency was extremely important to him. And at every single meeting when we talked about this, the rallying cry from Jeff and others like voters and I would say the other four of us on the task force was that the Open Government Commission needed to have teeth. This was not just supposed to be a body that says, hey, there's a problem and then everything moves on. How do we make sure that when they make a finding, something happens that causes the city to kind of sit up and reassess? Well, I appreciate that. The staff report in the step reporting that the idea that just a finding that is written that says there's a violation will make the city really reconsider it. I think the one time this has happened shows that that was not true. In fact, the city went into full battle mode to tell the ask, you know, basically ask the Open Government Commission to reconsider, not just null and void, but reconsider their decision that a sunshine violation had happened. Right. Everybody put all their power into discrediting the finding of the of the sunshine of the of the Open Government Commission rather than just re agenda using the darn thing and having it done. I mean, that was what was kind of silly to me about this whole thing. It was such an easy cure. And yet we spent months talking about this thing. So I agree completely with with Councilmember de Sug and others that I mean, obviously, the staff lawyers, three of them now that, you know, from as as they have explained it to me, because I am not an attorney, but well, that null and void is not a legal finding. And now that we have all this written about this, it is problematic, you know, that there was a lot of concern around this issue that somebody would sue. There is going to be an issue, whether it's around development or something else that is hot and right, that's going to drive somebody to file a sunshine complaint that's going to put us in a legal position. And if we have some, you know, we're going to end up in court at some point in time fighting null and void and in it. So but at the same time, I am not supportive of just removing it and hoping that at the end of the day, the Open Government Commission's finding is, you know, it's just a finding that sent and hopefully somebody cares enough to take it back up. So, you know, the way I've been thinking about this, knowing that we, you know, it's problematic for this for this body or anybody to undo the actions of the council. You know, we also know that that sometimes actions of the council take a little time to to. You know, we we we give we set up ordinances all the time that take 30 or 60 or 90 days to actually really get up. You know, we might pass a law, but enforcement of that law really doesn't happen for 60 or 90 days if a violation is found. You know, I would propose that that we have a sunshine ordinance that requires that that agenda, that item get agenda based on the next, you know, reasonable agenda for consideration. And that that consideration be both a finding of concurrence or non concurrence with the with the Open Government Commission's finding, but also that it would be that it would include a an opportunity to cure the issue. So actually what they would do is actually put some pressure. The simplest path would not be to find against the Open Government Commission. The simplest path would be to rehear the item and cure the item. You know, and I think that that if we were to write something that also basically said that we will maintain the status quo during that 30 or 40 day period to get it back up on that agenda. Basically, that means that there's, you know, back to the trust issue. There's not that time for, you know, staff or the council to somehow sneakily do a lot of work on the on it while it while it's in existence. It doesn't it doesn't remove that. But it but it basically gives the the the public the opportunity to come back to that body at a publicly at a properly noticed meeting and to weigh in not only on whether there's violation, but weigh in also on the issue itself, publicly noticed at that point in time, it's you know , I don't want to you know, it's not the same as null and void. It does not undo that. I've heard that. Oh, it's not on doing it because the council can also pass it. But if the council doesn't repass it, it's been undone that I do. You know, I, I am convinced of that. Yeah. I'm going to end by just sharing a quick story. As an advocate, I went to the. California Transportation Commission. They badly noticed something that was very significant and had a big timeline. And we filed a complaint ahead of the meeting that that they had not noticed this properly. And then because they didn't know who I was, I sat with with the staff and the county and the council members. The staff said, don't worry about it. You just pass it tonight, give everybody the assurance that it's going to happen and we'll just bring it back and notice it in 30 days. Right. And then they realized that I was there and everybody ran off and and huddled separately. I want to make sure that we're not getting ourselves in that situation where basically we you know, it's just that the finding is just kind of perfunctory. I think Councilmember Vela spoke, too, that there needs to be something that puts a little bit more teeth in that, which brings it back and puts it on the dais and on tape and allows people to stand up and speak. And so if we can come to something that replaces null and void with with an acceptable alternative, you know, I can support it. But, you know, and I'm not I'm not supportive of the staff's recommended language of just removing one void and kind of hoping shame is enough . Councilmember Councilmember O.D.. Thank you. Thank you for also letting me not go first. Yeah. I was working on it. And trust me, you're not the Iowa Democratic Party, so we will get out of here on time today. Do we have results? I was working. So I also appreciate Councilmember De Sykes comments. Sometimes the non-lawyer distills it in a way that we all can understand. I would just add to it that, you know, there's also the restraints of the United States and the California Constitution. So we could pass any law we want. We could think it's great because Jeff Mitchell thinks it's great. But if it's not constitutional, you know, it's it's not it shouldn't be there. So and I also appreciate both the suggestion from the vice mayor and the suggestion from Councilmember Dysart, you know, that we do replace it with something . So there needs to be some teeth to it and there needs to be some calling out of the council. If we do do something that violates the Sunshine Ordinance, you know, like the idea of immediately putting it on an agenda that we either agree or disagree and then move forward one way or the other. And then, you know, if somebody wants to sue, I mean, there's an opinion on the sunshine or the Open Government Commission, you know, that will have some weight. And then if the council doesn't really have anything supporting of that, you know, I understand that. My only concern here and, you know, I think this is going to not be an issue 99% of the time. So let's not let's not ignore the elephant in the room on what happened here. My my concern is that someone and I'm not saying anyone did this because I think the people on the Open Government Commission exercised their judgment based on their understanding of the rules. And I am not saying anything about the person who filed the complaint, but others, not anyone in this room, not anyone who filed a complaint did say to me that they were going to use that to try to overturn the cannabis. So and which normally wouldn't be a big deal. Right. But the problem that happened was there was an election, there was a swearing in of new people that many people in the community thought had different opinions on it, and that they were going to they were going to use this as a sword to implement their policy and not as a shield to protect the public from non transparency. So and I remember my first meeting, we spent the entire time discussing Del Monte, you know, I can't believe it's still not ground broke yet or maybe it's close to it, but it's been, you know, five, five months. And I guess the argument that was made and maybe it's a legitimate one was that the agenda item said we were discussing delivery only cannabis and then we just and to dispensary's and yet we decided to bump that up to four. So I think that was kind of the that was kind of the gist of the complaint and the finding. So I went back and I remember I went to the meeting on December 2nd, 2014. I sat in the audience back where Catherine sitting now and we had a discussion on the first reading of the De Monte Project and 35 speakers got up. I just kind of the minutes and then after the public comment had closed and the DEA and the masterplan were there, there was a suggestion from the dias to reduce the number of housing units from 414 to 380. Okay. Well, if you're not a housing advocate, you probably don't care about that. But if you are a housing advocate, you didn't go to that meeting thinking that was going to happen, and you didn't go to that meeting thinking that was going to happen after the public comment was closed. So and then we had the second reading, which I wasn't there for, and then we had the thing. So I mean. I think we've got to be careful about what happens during that period when we have a switch, because I think this can be used in a negative way. Now, that's the people that, you know, were against this project, probably didn't know this tool was there and didn't use it. But, you know, if there was a motion to move approval of adding an addendum to modify the master plan on the date to not include city portion A partial B reduced the number of housing units from 414 to 380. And they didn't know about it. I mean, to me, that sounds like a worse violation than anything this council was accused of. So if there are some safeguards that can be put in place during that interim, when there's a change or there might be a change to try to undo a council decision, you know , I'd be open to hear what that is. And the but you know, on the flip side, you know, we don't want to jam things in at the end either. So there has to be some safeguard there. So giving some direction either to the C or staff to develop some replacement that meets the needs that I've heard from my colleagues. But also, you know, doesn't allow this to be used as a sword when there's a change of election, I think would be would be would be super critical to me. Thank you. So I'll go last and thank you all for your time and attention and your emails, your remarks this evening and to staff who's put a lot of time and effort into this. There is an adage in law which is bad facts make bad law. And I do recall the particular item that generated the complaint that Ms.. Chan referenced, and I, I was upset about that, too. But at the same time, we have to follow the law and my colleagues to the left and the right. Councilmember Desai again, Vice Mayor Knox, while I think articulated very well, I come at the remedy a little differently what our authority is, what our authority is, and we have to respect the authority that has been delegated to us, and that is not delegate role to others. I do feel that the order to cure remedy is adequate and sufficient. I would certainly be interested in the you see the Open Government Commission if they so choose to, coming up with something that incorporated some of the suggestions we've heard to make sure, for instance, that there is a set time period so someone's complaint does not languish. But I would emphasize that we have a city attorney's office that takes great pride in doing good legal work and advising the city and its boards and commissions. Everyone is certainly capable of making mistakes because we're all human. But this particular issue has been scrutinized extensively, and I am confident in the in the outcome that we've seen. The question was asked the rhetorical question, so what's the harm if we just let the the null and void clause stand? The harm, I would say, is essentially what Councilmember Desai alluded to. This is not a power we can delegate. And then two points that Councilmember Odie raised. It isn't just about an improperly noticed item. That's not the only thing the null and void remedy could be applied to. It could, in the right set of hands be applied to a law that someone doesn't like. And that's that's that's a concern. And again, we were elected to do this job. Now we've heard it said, by gosh, even the League of Women Voters that people don't trust elected representatives. Well, here's the thing. I say this often. If you choose to be an elected office, you better have thick skin, a sense of humor and a backbone. And I can attest to the fact that every one of us sitting up here don't all agree come from different perspectives. But we're working awfully hard for the people we represent. And then I would further quote my favorite president of recent times, Barack Obama, who in his closing address to the nation said, And if you don't like the folks who are representing you and you think you can do better, pick up a clipboard, collect the signatures, and run for public office. And and I wish more people would serve on our boards and commissions. Use that as a. A stepping stone to elected office. I happen to think we have great representative government in this city. We've come to a point of disagreement on this particular item, but I take very seriously the advice that the city attorney's office has given us. I've read the references to the case law and the city charter. And so I, I support the amendments, all of them that the city attorney's office is recommending. But I would also entertain a further remedy not to bring, you know, null and void light back, but to make sure that the intent, the spirit of this law is is honored. And it was something I was going to say, and there is something that concerned me in the staff report, and perhaps it was paraphrased in correctly, but it it did talk about it. And I, I didn't feel that Mr. Lay was burying his lead when he talked about there was agreement on nine of the ten amendments. There were. I think it's maybe just a way to transition in, but be that as it may, it is stated in the staff report and maybe I'm interpreting it wrong, but the commission further stated first they didn't agree with the null and void decision. Commission further stated that it would not support any similar amendment. So I'm concerned that what that means what if first, if indeed that's what the commission said, because they didn't go back and listen to the the actual meeting. But I would expect that our boards and commissions will work cooperatively and collaboratively with our city attorney's office and vice versa because we respect all of our times. But I think that we can come we can maybe have some additional guidelines that make sure that people who have a complaint are taken seriously. I mean, the analogy to the the penalty, the ref, you know, dropping the the filing the penalty, I will say coming so soon after the Super Bowl was a little painful. But hey, but but that it does stop stop the game until they go and, you know, review the the tape and look at it from all those different angles. I still didn't think that was a touchdown the other night. But anyway, I'm over it almost. But you know something that makes sure that, yes, this is taken seriously. You you tell us that that we there needs to be in order to cure it comes to the city council as quickly as possible. And we don't, you know, buried under the rug. So if someone, you know, wants to suggest a way to do that, I'm all ears and that's all for me. Thank you. Let's start with Councilmember Velvet and the vice mayor, then Councilmember Odie Councilmember. So there was a suggestion earlier by a couple of members of the public that there may be some sort of task force similar to the original task force or that it go back to the Open Government Commission for them to to weigh in on. I think when we had the task force, we didn't necessarily have the AGC and I don't know what happened in 2015. There was a reference to a review of that. I don't know if that was in connection with being on the AGC because I know Mr. Foreman has been on it before, but perhaps the AGC could could weigh in and let us know what options may work or that they think they could recommend in terms of giving something, giving some teeth to this. I also think looking at the process in nine B, because right now we're saying that we want it to come back quickly from the GC. But again, if there's six weeks between when the complaint is filed and the AGC hears it, that could be problematic. And maybe we want to give them some direction that they can hold. Meeting dates that can be posted on the calendar. If there's no complaint filed, then they can just not have their meeting, which is what other boards do. And then the other thing is, with the Sunshine Ordinance in place, that quick turnaround may be difficult. So if they have a regularly scheduled meeting that this is heard at and depending on when in the month that is, yeah , we may need to have some clause in there that allows them to expedite re agenda using it before the council because of the delay. And I'm out of time. Okay. Vice Mayor. I have on our screen, I think I saw staff working on something. I was just going to ask if they pass a. They had language they might want to propose based on the commentary that they've heard. Jon Stewart Sorry, it's not up here, but I was going to warn you that I see you typing, okay? Like, I can't. I can't even read it that small. I just. It seemed like SAP was trying to possibly put put together something. And, you know. His staff want to comment. Oh, so, Madam Mayor, if I may. Yes, I would need a mirror to read that. We've been we've been hearing the council comments and then speaking. To the microphone, please. Oh, yes, we've been hearing the council's comments. And we've we're we've drafted up something for the council's consideration, which I believe addresses both the vice mayor and council member de Suggs concerns that they've raised, which is that one, it comes back to the original commission or the council as soon as practicable, and that this amendment further requires the originating body to make a decision based on the OGC recommendation, which may involve agreeing and caring or disagreeing, and that it further takes into account the vice mayor's concern, which is that lots of things could be happening in the meantime, so that this amendment also provides that the city would take all necessary actions to the extent authorized by law to maintain the status quo. Okay, let's hold that thought, because I think the vice mayor inlets, were those your comments that you could see them? I mean, yeah, that that looks I just wanted to find out if there was possible language before we started possibly developing new task forces and whatever else. But yeah, I am. Thank you for that. Were you done in our call on council member? Thank you. I'm not so sure about that maintaining the status quo because there is a law in place about ordinances and when they take effect in 30 days and so on and so forth. So that would kind of overrule that. And I don't know if that works, but I like the idea of council development in about you having meetings regularly scheduled that if there is some issue that it can be addressed ASAP. I also think that ONGC probably is the best body to come up with ideas on how they think that a violation can be enforced most effectively. I mean, there's a fine provision there and we all care about the budget and that may be something that that maybe can be enhanced. The question I did have, though, and we kind of didn't touch on it because we went into the No. One void, but this whole idea that it supersedes other laws, I mean, does that mean anything that it that's different in the past is changed or anything that we passed in the future that conflicts which hopefully neither of our none of our staff lets us do how? I just was not sure about that. So council members and the laws cannot anticipate what you would do in the future and it cannot bind future councils. So what it does is that it supersedes laws that were in existence at the time of the adoption. In fact, when you adopt an ordinance, you always adopt a provision called implied repeal, which is in any law that's inconsistent with the ordinance that you're adopting at the time. It's a is repealed to the extent necessary to effectuate your new law. So your new law will always take precedence. Well, we should make that clear. That's all. My time is up. To the council everyday. So with 70 seconds, I'm going to speak quickly. It's hard for me to understand whether or not the proposed language has teeth, but I'd love to get input from the AGC or anyone else on that on what's proposed here. And I will make a motion to extend the time because I think this is a an important issue and I don't see that it serves any. Okay. How much time, folks? I'm sorry. Four. Okay. Okay. Motion to extend time. 5 minutes for everybody. Yes. Okay. Okay. That's a second. I've got a motion second on favor. I, I think Councilmember Desai seconded. Okay. Okay. So continue, Councilmember. So that's basically my point. I said it in 17 seconds. I would bring it input as to they understand our broad parameters or broad parameters. It has to be consistent with the charter as we discussed it. But we also have to believe that within those parameters we can still come up with something that's that's that has teeth , but it's just not null and void null and void concept. Okay. So your recommendation to send it back to the board, you see, and that would be the remedy I would favor as opposed to convening yet another subcommittee because I think we want to keep this moving forward. Um, who else didn't finish their comments to Councilmember Gallo? I was going to say, I think having it go back to the AGC makes sense. In this instance, I'm a little wary about drafting something tonight and then adopting it, especially in light of the topic that we're discussing. So I'm not going to be supporting I think that that clearly there are other ideas that exist that are out there. Perhaps these can be brought to the GC and discussed and noticed properly and all of that. I do think, like I said, creating a process similar to call for review or appeal to planning board where we have kind of a date set and a turnaround possible would be helpful. Keeping in mind the other provisions of the Sunshine Ordinance that require us to notice things ten days before and all of that, and because I do worry about an instance, let's say, where it's not a cannabis issue that we're dealing with, but we're dealing with an exigent ordinance. For instance, when we were looking at the issue that impacted a tenant who was going to be evicted, who was a Holocaust survivor, and the emergency ordinance that we put into place, and if that had been formed, what that would mean. So and perhaps it's the AGC that can make the determination to suspend certain rules for noticing and still comply with the Brown Act. But maybe not because it's already been been heard and is now being cured, that there's a shorter time frame for adding to the agenda, an item like that. And my observation would be that since this is the first reading of an ordinance, I think these amendments might take this a bit beyond what we first contemplated and would recommend would would need another first reading anyway. So I would certainly support sending it back to the Open Government Commission. But again, to work with the City Attorney's Office and I am quite confident we will follow the city attorney's recommendations, but I think this can be made a bit better and give some reassurances and however that needs to be worded. Council Would we at least say that this this amended draft might be a good starting point to to work from? I. I don't think so. I don't like the maintaining the status quo because you're basically overriding the state law. Well, no, I'm saying to send back to the the Open Government Commission very fine. Without that, the city shall take all necessary action sentence. If you will. That could be directed to staff. Yeah. Okay. Just adopting it as is with the direction that we've all decided we want to give. I don't know. I don't know what adopting the ordinance is now. It's going to be modified. Why would we adopt it now. For a new first reading? Life we adopted and then tell The Odyssey to come back in two or three months with replacement. I don't want. That. But then in the in the intervening time, this would be the councilman, I mean, councilmember like to be on the council member city attorney. I think Mr. Councilmember Otis point is to adopt a staff recommendation with direction to review. I think that's okay. So I think you're in agreement with the mayor. Okay. Speaking a different language. Okay. Got it. Okay. So are you making a motion? Sure. I'll make a motion to. Adopt the. Adopt the staff report as written with direction for staff to work with the Open Government Commission to find a replacement, an effective replacement to the null and void remedy based on our discussion and anything else they may have. Okay. We have a motion by Councilman Brody and a second by Councilmember de suck discussion Vice Mayor next week. So I won't be supporting this motion. I feel that we should. Like I said in my comments, I'm happy to remove null and void, but I'm only going to remove it when I know what the remedy is. Because I think that removing something like take all necessary actions to maintain the status quo puts us into the they're now making a finding, but everybody just ignores it. And it's basically it has it it removes any meaning and teeth. I'm also going to just we didn't talk about it but the the the fine $250 public works getting the transportation commission getting fined for violating the Brown Act $250 transfer is going to send 250 bucks. Right. You know, laughing to the finance department. I mean, it's not you know, I don't the fine doesn't really unless we're getting into tens and tens of thousands of dollars, it's not going to have a real big impact on noticing in this body because it doesn't the people getting fined are not the people sitting here. So I have. Interject an inquiry. Or. Would you like staff direction to include that you would like the fines and penalties provision revisited. I even if you're not supporting the motion, would you like to see that be part of staff direction? But you don't have to. Sure. Yeah, I just I guess what I'm trying to say is I. Think that's a good point. And then you had more to say. I do, yes. I would like to make sure that our direction is that that, you know, to to the mayor's point earlier, it's I have very much appreciated hearing from almost all the, uh, open government commission members and their concern about removing null and void, but that the direction is that it's going to be removed and that we are accepting the city, the city attorney's position on this. And therefore, I just want to make sure that if we're going to send it back to the Open Government Commission, that we're trying to find that balance where, you know, to me, all necessary actions to maintain the status quo gets us to a place where they're not repealing it. They're just slow walking there. The roll out, their vice mayor, former vice mayor, city council member, fellow still vice mayor, in my mind, you know, came up with the, you know, the idea of maybe if it's an emergency know, maybe there's some exceptions where whatever else. But but I, I feel like for me in order to repeal this, I need to know what I'm repealing it for. I don't want to repeal it. And then in three months, come back and say, yeah, we can't agree on what's going in there. So now it's just repealed and we have nothing. So which, which I fear is, is a possible outcome. And I will just add that I couldn't support anything that is keeping the null and void option in because we've heard several times over that it's it's not a valid remedy given the charter and our authority. So. But we have a motion in a second. Is there any further I'm sorry, Councilmember Rivera. So I'm not going to be supporting this motion and for similar reasons as the vice mayor, I would also I think this has been on the books for a long time, and then we knew it was an issue when the complaint got filed. So. For me, it seems like it's been on the books. We knew there was an issue, there was legal research and we've kind of gone back and forth. And so I don't see the harm in waiting another month or 60 days for the GC to weigh in and give us a remedy because it has been on the books for this period of time and I would like that process to happen and to have some teeth proposed that we can all live with and then put it in there so that it works. So I'm I have a similar position as the Vice Mayor. And I'm looking forward to the AGC coming back with something. But my only point to that is I think we all agree that that is not an authorized remedy under our Charter or the Constitution. So, I mean, if we had an ordinance that says you can discriminate against women and we know that that's unconstitutional, would we just keep that in there until we fix it or would we take it out because we know it violates the law? Okay. We have a motion. We have a second. All in favor. I just want to say you. Yes, yes. Sorry. Yes. The quick comment I want to make is I do think that the points that Councilmember Vela and Vice Mayor Knox White are valid, because if we do take a vote, we run the risk of of taking the leverage out that the GC might have because we've made a decision that we're going to. But but by the same token, Councilmember Odie raises a good point that if there is a rule that that is in contradiction to, to a higher rule, do we sit around and let it be? So for me, I'm going to have to believe I'm going to have to have faith that the city attorney is going to work in good faith with the Open Government Commission and the public in creating the language that that is akin to null and void, that does provide some teeth, but is aligned with how we're interpreting the city charter. So I'm going to have faith that that's going to occur even as we move forward with staff recommendations. So that's why I will remain in favor of the vote. Thank you. All in favor. I oppose. No. No. The motion carries 3 to 2. And I just want to comment that this has been an excellent council discussion and I really appreciate the very thoughtful comments and also the melding of different suggestions and perspectives. Thank you, everyone. We look forward to this coming back to us and I'm ready to go on to the next item, people. Okay. Remind me what that is. 60, 60. We have 60 up next. Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. We are conducting a council meeting. Excuse me, Mr. Peterson. I'm going to call a break if you don't leave now. Miss Smith, would you please would you please give us the. Can I read the title really quickly? Thank you.

Thank you. Council in Montreal. Your motion to adopt. Thank you, Mr. President. I move that proclamation 16 be adopted. It has been moved in seconded comments from members of council. Councilwoman Monteiro. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I want to say that I'm thrilled to be able to offer the support of this part of the Council, hoping that it will pass for the RTD application for the National Western Center. I believe that this will be one of the major candlelit catalytic projects for global Illyria Swans here, the state and the region. We we have a great application moving forward and we wouldn't want to come to Denver and experience the urban Southwest unique combination of agriculture, industry and academic process while enjoying an exciting array of modern multi-use facilities integrated with the history and culture of the surrounding neighborhoods. This is the last chance for Denver and the metro area to take advantage of the Regional Tourism Act, as this is a final application process that will be funding projects under the statewide Act. I can't imagine a better project that could meet the desired outcomes of the RTD, RTA while preserving a Colorado treasure. As I mentioned earlier at the National Western Center, we have the base and momentum with our record breaking attendance at the stock show this year. Final attendance, as I said before, was 600 682,539. Which is 42,517 17 attendees higher than last year. We have a growing event and we want to build on and make it an even more attractive local, national and international event year round. This is very significant because part of applying for the RTA is that we're able to demonstrate that we want. Tourists. And we have the entertainment and all the possibilities and the leverage and the political will to have to have the National Western grow and be part of this. So this couldn't be more perfect for the RTA. The new vision for the National Western Center will become a must see tourist attraction that will give great hope, greater economic gains for our city. The National Western Citizens Advisory Committee that includes neighbors from Galerius wants you local neighborhood registered neighborhood organizations. Local Business Owners, Colorado State University, National Western Stock Show, Denver Museum of Nature and Science Focus Points, Family Resource Center. Visit Denver Historic Denver History, Colorado Groundwork Denver. Riverside Cemetery Clinica Ted Byock, Habitat for Humanity Rhino Arts in Grow House has written a letter of support for the RTA. A application as well. And we believe this application will help to uplift the neighborhoods through improved connectivity for local streets, educational and employment opportunities, open space including activation of the river and areas for community building and expertize at the National Western with our critical partners, co-founders, National Western Stock Show, CSU and the Globe Illyria neighborhood. We are building a creative culture that people will want to be a part of, and I look forward to seeing it. All. Come to fruition. Thank you, Mr. President. And I look forward to the support of my colleagues for this RTA application proclamation. Thank you. Thank you. Councilwoman Monteiro. Councilman Brooks. I thank you, Mr. President. And I want to thank Councilwoman Monteiro for bringing this proclamation forward. This is huge. This isn't just another application that we just get lucky to have in in the city of Denver. Number one, this is the last of its kind for the state. But number two, and Councilwoman Monteiro so eloquently put this together, it's bringing grass tops and grass roots together. Urban agriculture in our in our state is the number one industry. And we are developing an urban ag center here in our city in one of the most underserved communities in our city. And to see how this has been beautifully woven together, it just makes a lot of sense. And it's going to bring a lot of individuals here to the city who who don't live in the city and will spend money in this city. And so we are in I am incredibly supportive of this. We are incredibly supportive of this. But I want to thank Kelly LEED and his team as well for for putting this together. It has been a huge effort to bring all the resources to put this application together. It's very, very complex. You got to get a lot of support. And I want to thank all the regional partners and I hope you, Kelly, will talk about those regional partners. When you come up here who have said, you know what, we think this is good for the region, not just for Denver and Globeville, Elyria, Swansea, but for the metro area. So I'm really excited about that. And Paul Andrews, who's worked so hard to to be excellent in this facility that he's in currently and has just done a great job of envisioning what this thing can be. And this is going to be so much bigger than the National Western Stock Show. It's going to be the center is going to be the connection point in this city where all of these sectors come together. And I'm really excited to support this. So thank you. Thank you so much for putting this together and Councilman Monteiro for reading it. Thank you. Thank you, Councilman Brooks. Councilman added. Thank you, Mr. President. I think Councilwoman Monteiro said it all. And what tiny bits that she didn't say, Councilman Brooks said. So I just wanted to add my enthusiastic support to this proclamation instead of just an I. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Levitt, the other comments. Proclamation 16. Seen none. Madam Secretary, roll call. Montero. I never I Ortega. I Rob I Shepherd. SUSSMAN All right. Brooks, I. Brown I thought I had each. LEHMAN All right. LOPEZ All right, Mr. President, I. Madam Secretary, please first vote in and announce the results. 3939 as Proclamation 16 has been adopted. Councilwoman Monteiro, is there anyone you'd like to have come to the podium to receive the proclamation? Yes, I would like to invite Kelly Lead from the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative and also a representative from National Western. You can come on up. Counsel, thank you so much. My name is Kelly LEED, and I'm the executive director of the North Denver Cornerstone Collaborative. But I'm appointed the mayor overseeing six projects in this region. And I think the National Western Project exemplifies the vision of the mayor, of how we strategically align these projects and ultimately their implementation, because this is as much about connecting neighborhoods and reclaiming our river and a big part of our city that's at our front door. So this has been this is a long journey that we're on. And I think the the early efforts of so many people, hundreds of people, to pull this together. And, you know, we're taking the plan through council now and the RTA application will get submitted in February. And this is the first of many steps towards taking this plan to reality. But I am enormously grateful for council support and for all the work of Paul and his team and everyone that's been involved. And this has been a lot of fun. So I'm just excited about making it real and this is the first step to make it real. We are competing against potentially two other municipalities for what is two remaining slots of the RTA and there's no guarantee we have to put our best efforts forward and we're, as I like to say, we're running like we're behind and we're going to submit the very best application we can to the state. But I'm hopeful that this will start a bigger conversation about the importance of the National Western to our to our state and to our our history and more importantly, not just about our past, but what's in front of us. I mean, we're going to solve big issues as part of this. And one of the best examples comes from Tony Frank. And we're going to have to figure out how to feed 9 billion people by 2050. And we have an opportunity to bring a collection of public and private homes together to talk about how we feed 9 billion people. And some of those solutions are going to come from this facility and the conversations we have at this facility. So with that, I think that just as an example of all the cool things that are going to come out of this and Paul, would you like to say anything? One quick word. You know, I just want to add that it is an honor and a pleasure to be standing here, partners with the man to my right , partners with all of you. The city and county of Denver and the National Western Stock Show have been partners since 1906. And I'm the happiest guy in the room that that's going to continue for the next hundred years due to the greatness that this complex will bring, not just to the National Western Stock Show, but the entire city, as you all have pointed out. So thank you to Kelly. Thank you, Judy, for all your great leadership that we wouldn't be at this point without you. So thank you very much. And all that's left to do is build it. Thank you. Thank you both. Thank you. Counsel Monteiro. Councilman Brooks, you had a comment? Yeah, I just wanted to have Kelly talk about the regional. So I think it's 22 municipalities are supporting this as well. Yeah. So, you know, one of the things that makes this, I think a testament to it being bigger than Denver is as of this last week, we have 24 front range cities that are supporting the application through a proclamation the mayor developed. And then last count was over 20 other just general letters of support from public, private and nonprofit interests that run the gamut. So I don't know what the final numbers will be, but I think there will be a broad spectrum of both public and private support for the application as it goes forward. Thanks. All right.

Just one sec here. Okay, let's move to committee reports. Please read the first agenda item. The report of the Governance, Equity and Technology Committee Agenda Item one Council Bill 119 427 relating to the regulation of the for hire industry, removing certain considerations between an exclusive driver representative, representative and the Director of Finance, Administrative Services and many sections 6.3 10.7 35 for code and repealing rules and regulations to the extent they are inconsistent with this ordinance. Committee recommends the bill passed. Thank you very much. I'll say a few opening words about what this bill is doing and then certainly turn it over to Councilman O'Brien, who shown your strong leadership in this area. So our goal in this legislation has always been to put the city of Seattle in the best position to address the issue of what we consider fair compensation to all TNC taxing for hire drivers without compromising the ability of these companies themselves to thrive in a competitive marketplace. In light of ongoing litigation, we are amending ordinance 124968, which provides council with most flexibility and options directly and efficiently to address the issue of driver compensation. The ordinance we passed in 2015, as many of you know, have been has been tied up in court. And our introduction of this bill, 119427, we think is common sensibly allows us to look at all options on the table regarding driver compensation without any more additional litigation delays. Again, just by way of background, in December 2015, you may recall that we passed an ordinance again under Councilmember Bryant's leadership and many of us looking at these issues relating to the regulation of the transportation and for hire industry and under which for hire drivers could determine whether or not to engage in collective negotiations over various terms with companies who contract with those drivers, examples being Uber, Lyft and and taxi companies. And among other things, the ordinance that we did pass elicited certain subjects to be collectively negotiated, including best practices relative to vehicle equipment standards, safe driving practices, criminal background checks, the nature and amount of payments made to or withheld from drivers hours and conditions of work, etc.. So I was one of the many council members who supported this. And again, the legislation today are just removing as a sub subject of bargaining the nature and amount of payments received by or withheld from drivers. There's a few other technical corrections, but nothing substantive in nature. So that's what we hope to do today. And Councilmember O'Brien, I hope I left you something to say with there. I'll turn it over to you. Council President, you did a great job of summarizing that. So you didn't leave me much to say, but I appreciate your support and strong words for this. I also support this legislation and I'll just reiterate that, that by taking this action, we still, as a body, reserve the right to to set fares and standards like we do for other parts of the industry. There's no plan at the moment to do that, but it's something that we might consider going in the future. But again, as you said, just to reiterate, this still leaves most of the terms of employment or work, I should say, for these independent contractors to be subject to the collective bargaining agreement . It just takes this one item out, as you mentioned. Very good. Any comments? I mean, our colleagues and I'll just say sort of in closing that as many of these TNC companies sort of struggle or are in many cities throughout this country and actually across the world with what a regulatory. Framework looks like. I'm really optimistic that we can figure this out in Seattle. What's fair to both the drivers, those, whether the part time or full time and to the companies themselves to allow competitive choices that we could figure out what a healthy regulatory scheme looks like here. And and again, maybe other cities in this country could sort of follow our lead. And that's the work we're going to do this year. And I look forward to it. So. Can I just ask question about the schedule? What do you anticipate and when do you think we would have something for review? Yeah, I know I should have talked that much and I was going to keep the question. I'm optimistic that first quarter this year we'll be firing up the committee and looking at these issues. We're still struggling with some issues on how to get some of the data that we want and the executives on board also assisting us , trying to get data on the types of rides and the number of rides in certain areas of the city, because there are other issues in addition to the composition of the drivers that we're concerned about with how our streets look. So but I anticipate first quarter of this year, we'll be doing some work on it. Okay. Having said that, please call the role on the passage of the bill. Make sure.
