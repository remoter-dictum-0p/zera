    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].

    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

","To calculate the area of a triangle given its three sides, we can first check if the triangle is valid by using the triangle inequality theorem which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Once we confirm that the triangle is valid, we can apply Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle using its three sides.

Here is the step-by-step plan for the implementation:
1. Check if the triangle is valid by verifying the triangle inequality theorem.
2. If the triangle is valid, calculate the semi-perimeter (half of the perimeter) of the triangle.
3. Using Heron's formula, calculate the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter and the three sides.
4. Return the area rounded to 2 decimal places.
5. If the triangle is not valid, return -1.

We can create the function `triangle_area(a, b, c)` to implement the above logic:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem
    if a + b > c and b + c > a and a + c > b:
        # Calculate the semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
        area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
        return round(area, 2)  # Return the area rounded to 2 decimal places
    else:
        return -1  # Return -1 if the sides do not form a valid triangle
```

This implementation first checks if the sides form a valid triangle, and if they do, it calculates and returns the area of the triangle.

","To determine if a list is sorted in ascending order with no more than 1 duplicate of the same number, we can iterate through the list checking if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. Additionally, we need to keep track of the count of each number and ensure that if a number appears more than once, it must be the immediately previous number. 

Here is a step-by-step logical plan:
1. Initialize a variable to store the count of the previous number (initialize to 1 as the first element will have one occurrence by default).
2. Iterate over each element in the list starting from the second element.
3. For each element:
   - Check if it is greater than or equal to the previous element.
   - If not, return False indicating the list is not sorted.
   - If it is equal to the previous element, increment the count.
   - If the count exceeds 1, return False indicating the list has more than one duplicate of the same number.
   - If it is a new number, reset the count to 1.
4. If the loop completes without returning False, return True indicating the list is sorted with at most 1 duplicate for the same number.

By following this plan, we can implement the `is_sorted` function as described in the problem statement. 

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    prev_num = lst[0]  # Initialize with the first element
    count = 1          # Count of the first element

    for i in range(1, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] < prev_num:
            return False  # Not sorted
        elif lst[i] == prev_num:
            count += 1
            if count > 1:
                return False  # More than 1 duplicate
        else:
            prev_num = lst[i]
            count = 1

    return True  # Sorted with at most 1 duplicate

","To implement the function `count_up_to(n)`, we need to generate an array of the first n prime numbers that are less than n.

We can approach this problem by creating a helper function that checks if a number is prime. Then, we iterate from 2 to n and filter out the prime numbers less than n.

Here is the step-by-step logic for the implementation:
1. Create a helper function `is_prime(num)` that takes a number as input and returns True if it is prime, otherwise False.
2. Initialize an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers less than n.
3. Iterate over each number i from 2 to n (exclusive).
4. For each number i, check if it is prime using the `is_prime` function.

    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of

    Otherwise return -1
    Three sides make a valid triangle when the sum of any two sides is greater 
    than the third side.

","To solve this problem, we need to check whether the given sides of the triangle form a valid triangle. A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Once we determine the validation, we can calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula if it is a valid triangle.

Here is the step-by-step logic:
1. Check if a + b > c, b + c > a, and a + c > b. If any of these conditions are not met, return -1 as the sides do not form a valid triangle.
2. If the sides form a valid triangle, calculate the semi-perimeter using the formula: s = (a + b + c) / 2.
3. Calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula: area = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)). Round the result to 2 decimal points.
4. Return the calculated area.

Let's proceed with implementing the function:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c or b + c <= a or a + c <= b:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    # Round the area to 2 decimal points
    area = round(area, 2)

","To implement the `factorize` function, we need to find all prime factors of a given positive integer `n`. The approach involves iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` to check for divisors. If a divisor is found, we add it to the list of factors. We then divide the number by that divisor and repeat the process until the number becomes 1.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:
1. Initialize an empty list to store the prime factors.
2. Start a loop from 2 to the square root of `n`.
3. Inside the loop, check whether the current number divides `n` evenly.
4. If a divisor is found, add it to the list of factors and update `n` by dividing it by the divisor.
5. Repeat this process until the number is reduced to 1.
6. Finally, return the list of prime factors in the order from smallest to largest.

Following this logic, we can implement the `factorize` function in Python as shown below:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    divisor = 2
    sqrt_n = int(math.sqrt(n))

    while n > 1 and divisor <= sqrt_n:
        if n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        else:
            divisor += 1
    
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return factors

","To implement the function `int_to_mini_roman`, the task involves converting a given positive integer into its Roman numeral representation. The rules for Roman numerals are well-defined with specific symbols assigned for different values, such as I, V, X, L, C, D, M representing 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 respectively.

The general strategy to convert an integer to a Roman numeral is to iteratively extract the largest possible Roman numeral symbol from the integer and append it to the final result. This process continues until the integer becomes 0. A key aspect to consider is the special cases where subtractive notation is used (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9, etc.).

A common approach is to create parallel lists or dictionaries mapping integers to their Roman numeral equivalents, then iterating through the mapping while processing the given integer. To handle subtractive notations, it is often helpful to check for specific patterns as we iterate through the mappings.

Therefore, we will proceed to implement the `int_to_mini_roman` function following this strategy.

```python
def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    # Define the integer to Roman numeral mapping
    roman_numerals = {
        1000: 'm', 900: 'cm', 500: 'd', 400: 'cd',
        100: 'c', 90: 'xc', 50: 'l', 40: 'xl',
        10: 'x', 9: 'ix', 5: 'v', 4: 'iv', 1: 'i'
    }

    # Ensure input is within the range 1 <= number <= 1000
    if not 1 <= number <= 1000:
        raise ValueError(""Input must be between 1 and 1000"")

    roman_numeral = ''  # Initialize the result
    
    # Iterate through the mapping and build the Roman numeral
    for value, numeral in roman_numerals.items():
        while number >= value:
            roman_numeral += numeral
            number -= value

    return roman_numeral  # Return the Roman numeral in lowercase
```

","Logical Reasoning:
To encrypt a string, we need to rotate each character by two multiplied to two places down in the alphabet. We'll approach this by following these steps:
- Initialize an empty string `encrypted` to store the encrypted result.
- Iterate over each character in the input string:
  - Check if the character is a lowercase alphabet letter.
  - Calculate the new position by moving the character down by two multiplied to two places in the alphabet.
  - Append the encrypted character to the `encrypted` string.
- Return the final `encrypted` string.

We have to consider the rotation within the lowercase alphabet (wrapping around if exceeding 'z') and handle non-alphabetic characters like spaces or punctuation.

car_race_collision","    return n**2
","Logical Reasoning:
To solve this problem:
- We can think of this as a question of pairs of cars crossing each other. 
- When a car moving left crosses a car moving right, it constitutes a collision.
- Since the cars' positions are symmetric, we can focus on one side and calculate the number of collisions, then double that to account for the other side.
- The time it takes for the collision to happen can be represented by the positions of the cars. In one time unit, their position relative to each other changes by 1 unit. 
- Consider the first car moving left to be at position 0, the next at position 1, the next at position 2, and so on. 
- The right-moving cars will start at positions 2n, 2n-1, 2n-2, and so forth.
- A collision happens when a car from the left set is at the same position as a car from the right set.
- The number of collisions happening at a particular position can be represented as the minimum of the car indices at that position (divided by 2 to get the true position).
- We then sum these minimum values for all positions to get the total number of collisions.

Implementation:
```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    total_collisions = sum(min(i, 2*n-i) // 2 for i in range(1, 2*n))

To determine if a list is sorted in ascending order with the specific requirements provided, we need to iterate through the list:
- We'll start by initializing two variables to keep track of the previous number (`prev_num`) and its occurrence count (`duplicate_count`).
- We then iterate through the list to compare each element with the previous one:
  - If the current number is less than the previous one, return False as the list is not sorted.
  - If the current number is equal to the previous one, we check if it is more than twice; if so, we return False.
  - Update the `prev_num` to the current element and reset the `duplicate_count`.
- If the loop completes without returning False, it implies the list is sorted while adhering to the specified conditions, hence return True.

def is_sorted(lst):
    prev_num = None
    duplicate_count = 1

max_fill","    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid])
","Logical Reasoning:
To solve this problem, we will iterate through the given grid of wells row by row. We will track the current water level in each column/position as we move from left to right. We will use this information to determine the number of times we need to extract water to lower the water level to the bucket_capacity.

Implementation:
1. Initialize a variable `num_times_to_lower` to keep track of the total times to lower the buckets.
2. Iterate through each row of the grid:
   - Start a loop from the leftmost column to the rightmost column.
   - While iterating, keep track of the current water level in the current column.
   - If the current water level exceeds the bucket_capacity, calculate the number of times we need to lower the water level and update `num_times_to_lower`.
3. Return the `num_times_to_lower` as the output.

This approach ensures that we correctly consider each well, its water level and how many times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty that particular well.

Let's now implement this approach in Python:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    num_times_to_lower = 0
   
    for row in grid:
        current_water_level = [0] * len(row)  # Track water level in current column
        for j in range(len(row)):
            # Calculate the water level in the current column
            for i in range(len(grid)):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    current_water_level[j] += 1

            # Calculate the number of times to lower the bucket
            if current_water_level[j] > capacity:
                num_times_to_lower += current_water_level[j] - capacity

    return num_times_to_lower
```

Approach:
- Initialize an empty list (`flipped_chars`) to store the flipped characters.
- Iterate through each character in the input string:
  - If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase and append to `flipped_chars`.

    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following steps:

- Check if this index is equal to 0. If it is, return True since the array is already sorted.
- After performing the necessary right shifts, we should have a sorted array. Verify if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. Iterate over each index and element in the input list.
3. Check if the index is a multiple of 3 or 4:
   - If it is a multiple of 3, square the element and add it to `sum_entries`.
   - If it is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, cube the element and add it to `sum_entries`.
4. Return the sum of the modified elements after iterating through the list.

Implementation:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    sum_entries = 0

    for index, element in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 3 == 0:

To find the biggest even integer number between the range `[x, y]`, we can iteratively start from `y` and move downwards checking if it's even. If we find the first even number, we can return it. If no even number is found, we return `-1`.

- Start iterating from `y` down to `x` inclusive.
- Check if the current number is even.
- Return the first even number found.
- If no even number is found in the range, return -1.

- We need to find the number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells.
- Initialize a variable `lowering_count` to 0 for keeping track of the total number of lowerings.
- Iterate through each column of the grid (each time a column represents a level for all wells).
- For each level, calculate the total water (sum of all 1s at that level) in the wells.
- Calculate the number of times the buckets need to be lowered at the current level.
- Increment `lowering_count` by this number of lowerings required.
- Return the final `lowering_count`.

- We need to consider the capacity of the buckets. Each lowering should be in multiples of the bucket capacity.
- We do not need to lower any buckets if all wells are empty.

- Initialize an empty string `result` to store the digits of the converted number.
- Perform a loop while `x` is greater than 0:
  - Find the remainder when dividing `x` by `base`.
  - Prepend this remainder to the left side of the `result` string (since we are converting right-to-left).
  - Update `x` to be the result of integer division of `x` by `base` to continue the process.
- Finally, return the `result` string which now contains the representation of `x` in the target base.

- If the input number `x` is 0, the result should also be '0' in any base.

    """"""


starts_one_ends","    if n == 1: return 1
    return 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))
","1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - We are tasked with writing a Python function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the count of the numbers of `n`-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.
  
2. **Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to consider two main cases:
     1. When `n = 1`, as there is only one `1`-digit integer that starts and ends with 1.
     2. For integers with more than one digit:
        - When constructing an `n`-digit number:
          - The first and last digits can independently be any number from 1 to 9 (non-zero).
          - For all the remaining digits in between, they can be any digit from 0 to 9.
        - This gives the count of numbers that start or end with 1 when considering all possibilities. 
        - However, there is an overlap for the numbers starting and ending with 1, so we need to subtract this overlap.
        - To avoid double counting, we subtract the count of `1`-digit numbers that start and end with 1.
  
3. **Implementation:**
   - Define the function `starts_one_ends(n)`.
   - Handle the special case where `n = 1`.
   - For `n > 1`, calculate the total number of `n`-digit numbers that start or end with 1.
   - Subtract the count of `1`-digit numbers that start and end with 1.
   - Return the final count.

4. **Edge cases:**
   - The function should work correctly with border cases where `n` is very small (such as 1) and very large (to ensure efficiency). 

Now, let's implement the code following this logic:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1  # Only one 1-digit number possible that starts and ends with 1

    total_numbers = 9 * (10**(n - 2)) * 2  # Total numbers start or end with 1
    overlap_correction = 9  # Correct for the 1-digit numbers that start and end with 1
    
    return total_numbers - overlap_correction

# Test cases
print(starts_one_ends(1))  # Output: 1
print(starts_one_ends(2))  # Output: 18
print(starts_one_ends(3))  # Output: 171
print(starts_one_ends(4))  # Output: 1620

","Reasoning:
- To solve this problem, we need to iterate through each number between `a` and `b`, inclusive, and identify the even digits.
- We will create a helper function `get_even_digits` that takes a number and returns a list of its even digits.
- Initialize an empty list to store the even digits found.
- Iterate through the numbers between `a` and `b`, inclusive:
  - Use the helper function to get the even digits of the current number.
  - If there are even digits, append them to the result list.
- Return the result list with even digits in ascending order.

Implementation: 

```python
def get_even_digits(num):
    return [int(d) for d in str(num) if int(d) % 2 == 0]

def generate_integers(a, b):
    result = []

","Reasoning:
- We need to return the sum of elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of the given array.
- Initialize a sum variable to keep track of the total sum of elements with at most two digits.
- Loop through the first k elements of the array:
    - Check if the absolute value of the element is less than 100 (has at most two digits):
        - If it satisfies the condition, add it to the sum.
- Return the final sum as the result.
- Consider constraints:
    - The array is non-empty, so no need to check for empty array.
    - Ensure constraints are satisfied for array length and k.
- There might be negative numbers in the array, so consider their absolute values for digit count.

Implementation:

```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    # Initialize sum of elements with at most two digits
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Loop through the first k elements in the array
    for i in range(min(k, len(arr))):  # Considering minimum of k and array length to prevent out of range
        if abs(arr[i]) < 100:  # Check if absolute value has at most two digits

    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path of length k means visiting exactly k cells (not
    necessarily distinct).
    You CANNOT go off the grid.
    A path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less

","Reasoning:
- We need to find the minimum path of length k in the grid by visiting exactly k cells.
- It must start from any cell and in each step move to any neighboring cell.
- A path A is considered less than a path B if the lexicographically ordered lists of the values on the cells in path A are lexicographically less than those in path B.
- One key observation is that for a path length k, the values will be from 1 to k+1, as every integer from 1 to N*N appears exactly once in the grid.
- We need to find the minimum path that meets the lexicographical ordering criteria.

Approach:
1. Find all starting points in the grid where the value is 1 (starting point for the path).
2. For each starting point, perform a Depth First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths of length k starting from that cell.
3. At each step in DFS, keep track of the visited cells and the current path.
4. In the DFS function, when reaching the path of length k, compare it with the current minimum path found so far based on the lexicographical ordering.
5. Update the minimum path if the current path is lexicographically less.
6. Return the ordered list of values in the minimum path found.

Implementation:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    def dfs(x, y, path):
        nonlocal min_path

        path.append(grid[x][y])  # Add current cell value to path

def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """"""
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    """"""


car_race_collision","    return n**2
","Reasoning:
- To determine the collisions, every left-moving car needs to be checked against every right-moving car.
- For each left car, if there are `k` right cars to its left, then there will be `k` collisions.
- Thus, the count of collisions for a left-moving car is the number of right-moving cars on its left side.
- The total number of collisions is the sum of collisions for all left-moving cars.
- To find the number of right cars to the left of a specific car `i`, we can consider there are `i-1` right-moving cars.
- With this logic, we can calculate the total number of collisions by summing up the counts from `1` to `n`.

Implementation:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Initialize total collisions
    total_collisions = 0

    # Loop through all cars from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Add the count of right-moving cars to the left of car i
        total_collisions += i - 1

    located between the orbit of planet1 and the orbit of planet2, sorted by 
    the proximity to the sun. 
    The function should return an empty tuple if planet1 or planet2
    are not correct planet names.

","Reasoning:
- Define a list of planets in the correct order from the Sun.
- Given two planet names `planet1` and `planet2`, we need to find the planets whose orbits lie between the orbits of `planet1` and `planet2`.
- We will first check if `planet1` and `planet2` are valid planet names from the list of planets, returning an empty tuple if either one is invalid.
- Find the indexes of `planet1` and `planet2` in the list of planets to determine the range of planets to return.
- Finally, return a tuple of planets whose indexes are within the range determined by `planet1` and `planet2`.

Implementation:

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    planets = [""Mercury"", ""Venus"", ""Earth"", ""Mars"", ""Jupiter"", ""Saturn"", ""Uranus"", ""Neptune""]

    # Find the range of planets between planet1 and planet2
    start = min(planets.index(planet1), planets.index(planet2)) + 1

    # Return planets whose indexes are within the range
    return tuple([planet for idx, planet in enumerate(planets) if start <= idx <= end])

- To solve this problem, we need to determine whether the input `n` is a prime number.
- We will define a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.

Implementation:
- Create a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime.
- In `x_or_y` function, call `is_prime` with input `n`, and return `x` if prime, otherwise return `y`.

The implementation steps are as follows:
1. Define a helper function `is_prime` that returns True if a number is prime, False otherwise.
2. Implement the `x_or_y` function:
   a. Call the `is_prime` function with the input `n`.

        lst.remove(res[-1])
        switch = not switch
    return res
","Reasoning:
- To implement the strange sort operation, we need to organize the elements starting with the minimum value, then the maximum of the remaining elements, and alternately continue this pattern.
- It's important to consider edge cases like an empty list, which should return an empty list as there are no elements to sort in any specific order.
- We can achieve this by sorting the input list in ascending order and then creating the output list by interleaving the sorted list's first half in the ascending order and second half in descending order.

Implementation:
- Sort the input list `lst` in ascending order.
- Initialize an empty list `result` to store the strange sorted elements.
- Divide the sorted list into two halves: `left` and `right`.
- Iterate over the range of half the length of the sorted list using `i`:
  - Append the element at index `i` from the left half of the sorted list to `result`.
  - Append the element at index `-i-1` from the right half of the sorted list to `result` to maintain the strange sorting order.
- If the original list had an odd number of elements, it will leave out the middle element in the final sorted list, which remains at the end.
- Return the constructed `result` list as the strange sorted list.

This logic accounts for sorting the list in a strange order as requested.

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    lst.sort()  # Sort the input list in ascending order
    result = []

    left = lst[:len(lst)//2]  # First half of the sorted list
    right = lst[len(lst)//2:]  # Second half of the sorted list

    for i in range(len(left)):
        result.append(left[i])
        result.append(right[-i-1])  # Append elements in reverse order from the right half

    if len(lst) % 2 != 0:  # If there is a middle element

- To calculate the area of a triangle given three sides, we can use Heron's formula, which calculates the semi-perimeter of the triangle and then uses it to find the area.
- First, we need to check if the given three sides can form a valid triangle. This is possible when the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
- If the sides do form a triangle, we calculate the semi-perimeter using the formula `(a + b + c) / 2`.
- With the semi-perimeter, we calculate the area using Heron's formula: `sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))`, where `s` is the semi-perimeter.
- The final result should be rounded to 2 decimal points.
- If the sides do not form a valid triangle (i.e., the given sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem), we return -1.

- We'll begin by initializing two variables: `product` as 1 (to hold the product of digits) and `has_odd_digit` as False (to confirm we've encountered at least one odd digit).
- Convert the integer `n` to a string to conveniently iterate digit-by-digit.
- For each digit, convert character back to integer, and then:
  - If it is odd (digit % 2 == 1), multiply it with `product` and set `has_odd_digit` to True.
- After going through all digits:
  - Return `product` if any odd digit was encountered.
  - Otherwise, return 0.

","Logical Reasoning:
- We have n cars moving in two opposite directions on an infinitely long straight road.
- Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, collisions do not affect their motion, and they continue after the collision.
- In the scenario provided, cars from both directions move at the same speed.
- To detect a collision, we observe that the cars are initially far from each other, and the collision happens when a car from one direction reaches a position previously occupied by a car from the other direction.
- We can deduce that the number of collisions is equal to the number of cars, as each pair of cars will collide exactly once.

The core of the algorithmic logic for this task:

- For each digit, converted back into integer form:
  - If the digit is odd (digit % 2 == 1), multiply it into `product`, and set `has_odd_digit` to True.
- After checking all digits:
  - If no odd digit was found (`has_odd_digit` is False), return 0.

- The task requires us to find three distinct integers within the given list that sum up to zero.
- We need to consider all possible combinations of three distinct elements within the list and check if their sum equals zero.
- To achieve this, we can use a nested loop to iterate through all combinations of three elements and check their sum.

Important Points:
- We should consider all distinct combinations, not permutations, as the order does not matter.
- We need to handle cases where the input list has less than three elements.
- It is necessary to check for distinct elements to avoid counting duplicates.

","Logical Reasoning:
- To determine how many times a given substring appears in the original string (considering overlapping occurrences), a straightforward approach involves iterating through the original string and checking if the substring matches different slices of the original string.
- We'll initialize a count variable to keep track of the number of occurrences found.
- Iterate over the original string with a loop that considers slices of the original string with the same length as the substring.
- For each slice, check if it matches the given substring, increment the count if it does.
- Return the count as the final result.

Important Conditions and Edge Cases:
- There are no specific edge cases mentioned for this task. However, considering an empty original string should return 0 occurrences.

Python Implementation:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    if not string or not substring:
        return 0

    count = 0
